To this aim, first, the spectrum sensing problem is reformulated to account for the PU mobility. Then, the effects of the PU mobility are studied with the objective to determine the parameters that affect the spectrum sensing functionality. For this, two performance metrics are analytically derived: i) the detection capability, which measures the PU mobility impact on the CR user detection probability; ii) the mobility-enabled sensing capacity, a new metric that measures the expected transmission capacity achievable by a CR user in the presence of PU mobility. The mathematical analysis is carried out in different scenarios, by using mobility and spectrum occupancy models. The results show that the detection capability is affected by five parameters: the PU protection range, the network region size, the PU mobility model, the CR spatial distribution, and the number of PUs that use the same spectrum band. Moreover, it is shown that the sensing capacity can significantly increase in the presence of PU mobility if the PU protection range is smaller than the network region size. The mathematical results are derived by considering the dynamic PU traffic, and validated through simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","startPage":"451","endPage":"456","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140001.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary-user mobility impact on spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6140001/","displayDocTitle":"Primary-user mobility impact on spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507689","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary-user mobility impact on spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p451cacciapuoti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07061S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140003,"authors":[{"name":"Bassem Zayen","affiliation":[""],"firstName":"Bassem","lastName":"Zayen"},{"name":"Aawatif Hayar","firstName":"Aawatif","lastName":"Hayar"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140003","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Fading","Cognitive radio","Computational modeling","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Monte Carlo methods","probability","radio spectrum management","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dimension estimation-based spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","false alarm probability","dimension estimation-based detector","DED","Akaike information criterion","AIC","minimum description length","MDL","binary hypothesis test","cumulative density function","CDF","Monte-Carlo simulation","Tracy-Widom distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sensing","dimension estimation","threshold calculation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of dimension estimation-based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","endPage":"466","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140003","startPage":"462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140003","abstract":"In this paper, we will derive closed-form expressions of false alarm probabilities for a given threshold for the dimension estimation-based detector (DED) using Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the minimum description length (MDL) criterion.

Information transmitted from the source passes through several wireless relay nodes before reaching the destination.

We study optimal power allocation strategies that maximize the end-to-end throughput of the network under the constraint of strictly limited interference to external users. We show that for networks that can be modeled as a line topology the optimal solution is achieved when the capacities of every intermediate link are equal and the interference power constraint is satisfied with equality. High- and low-SNR approximations that simplify the problem of finding the optimal power allocation are presented as well. The numerical results show good performance compared to schemes with equal power allocation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12507694","htmlLink":"/document/6140006/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p472girnyk.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073102S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6140007,"authors":[{"name":"Musbah Shaat","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Musbah","lastName":"Shaat","id":"37392258400"},{"name":"F.

The interference to the PU resulting from the transmission from the cognitive nodes is kept below a specified limit. First, we consider relay beamformer designs assuming the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI). For this case, a mean-square error (MSE)-constrained beamformer that minimizes the total relay transmit power, and an MSE-balancing beamformer with a constraint on the total relay transmit power are proposed. Next, we consider relay beamformer designs assuming that the available CSI is imperfect. For this case too, we consider the same problems as those in the case of perfect CSI, and propose beamformer designs that are robust to the errors in the CSI.

In a cognitive radio, multiband receivers are required to make use of unused frequency bands. On the other hand, MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) spatial multiplexing is also used to increase transmission capacity. This paper proposes a multiband MIMO receiver with ordered successive detection based on heterodyne reception. Because the use of an RF-BPF (radio frequency-bandpass filter) with a wide pass band is required in the receiver for multiband reception, the heterodyne receiver suffers from image-band interference. Therefore, the proposed receiver is designed not only to detect spatially multiplexed signals but also to suppress image-band interference. Computer simulation shows that the proposed receiver achieves superior BER performance even in the presence of strong image-band interference signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140011.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiband MIMO receiver with ordered successive detection for cognitive radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Bit error rate","Vectors","Interference","Training","MIMO","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","cognitive radio","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband MIMO receiver","ordered successive detection","cognitive radio","multiband receiver","multiple-input multiple-output spatial multiplexing","heterodyne reception","radio frequency-bandpass filter","image-band interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A multiband MIMO receiver with ordered successive detection for cognitive radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140011/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507699","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiband MIMO receiver with ordered successive detection for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p498ohta.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058541S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140013,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Vakili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Vakili","id":"38232344500"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140013","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Signal detection","Discrete Fourier transforms","Random variables","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive energy detection technique","cognitive radio networks","primary user","secondary users","spectrum sensing technique","performance evaluation","ED"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive energy detection technique applied to cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","endPage":"514","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140013.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140013","startPage":"509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140013","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is an important functionality of cognitive radio as a means to detect the presence or absence of an existing user (EU), including the primary user or other secondary users, in a certain spectrum band. Energy detector (ED) is a widely used spectrum sensing technique based on the assumption that the EU is either present or absent during the whole sensing period. However, this assumption is not realistic in a dynamic environment where the EU could appear or disappear at any time. The performance of the conventional ED actually deteriorates in the scenario where the EU activity status changes during the sensing period.

However such networks have their own set of implementation and performance issues. Clustering helps in organizing the networks and providing a backbone for routing data packets over multi-hop links. However multi-hopping itself can cause a loss in performance compared to single-hop systems. This is because, as shown in the paper, the ergodic capacity of links in such networks is a decreasing function of the number of hops. Also error-propagation over multiple hops can result in a much reduced performance. Hence it is beneficial to reduce the number of hops in multi-hop networks. One way to do this is to employ cooperative MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) techniques to increase the range of these devices. This will result in reducing the number of hops. However incorporating cooperative MIMO in an ad-hoc network without central control and with self-organised routing can be challenging. In this paper, we present a novel joint clustering and routing mechanism to simplify and define the procedure for nodes to employ cooperative MIMO to gain an increase in performance. We introduce the concept of 'cooperative-MIMO-linked neighboring clusters' and describe how that can be used in conjunction with our specialized routing mechanism AOCMR (Ad-hoc On-Demand Cooperative MIMO Routing), to enable nodes to efficiently communicate in large scale networks in a decentralized manner.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint clustering and routing scheme to maximize link performance in cooperative MIMO ad-hoc networks","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140015","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140015.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A joint clustering and routing scheme to maximize link performance in cooperative MIMO ad-hoc networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140015/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507703","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint clustering and routing scheme to maximize link performance in cooperative MIMO ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p51zafar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037226S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6140017,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Imadur Rahman","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Kista, Sweden"],"lastName":"Muhammad Imadur Rahman","id":"38184234600"},{"name":"J\u00f6rgen S.

By using different types of radar characteristics (e.g. radio navigations radars, meteorological radars, etc) and a protection requirement of -10dB Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR), we have shown that in some scenarios, the required distances for adjacent channel radar usage in 2.7-2.9GHz band are quite reasonable. This means, in those scenarios, it could be possible to utilize the radar bands for secondary LTE systems. A protection margin of 18 to 20dB can be added for capturing the aggregate interference effects from multiple secondary interferers for downlink direction.

However, the wide deployment of WiFi access points in unlicensed bands in urban areas brings difficult challenges regarding co-existence of ad hoc mobile users with residential access points. In this paper, we propose a new mobile user protocol for dynamic channel selection via channel workload estimation.

The design goal is to minimize the total transmitted power across the secondary transmitters subject to the constraints of the received SINR at each secondary user and the received interference power at each primary user.We propose two alternative decentralized approaches where iterative beamformer designs are based on primal and dual decomposition methods. Beamformers are calculated locally relying on the limited backhaul message passing between secondary transmitters. Since the original problem is convex, both decentralized approaches converge to the globally optimal solution for static users' channels. Moreover, a feasible set of beamformers are guaranteed at each iteration. The proposed beamformer designs apply directly to the case of hierarchical femtocell networks where multiple macro- and femtocells co-exist. Convergence behavior of the algorithms is demonstrated through simulations. In addition, sum power performance of the optimal decentralized beamforming is compared with zero-forcing beamforming in a quasi-static flat fading scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12507713","htmlLink":"/document/6140025/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized coordinated downlink beamforming for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized coordinated downlink beamforming for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p566pennanen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054316S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6140027,"authors":[{"name":"Shamsad Parvin","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Elctro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shamsad","lastName":"Parvin","id":"37848415400"},{"name":"Takeo Fujii","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Elctro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37277000800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140027","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140027","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Delay","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Routing protocols","Spread spectrum communication","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication network routing","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum aware routing","multihop cognitive radio mesh networks","communication paradigm","spectrum scarcity problem","distributed routing","primary user","channel priority lists","secondary users"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140027","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140027.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel spectrum aware routing scheme for multi-hop cognitive radio mesh networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) technology is a new communication paradigm that can be a solution for the spectrum scarcity problem. A new open spectrum operation necessitates a novel routing scheme to exploit the available spectrum opportunistically. In this paper, we propose a distributed routing scheme for multi-hop cognitive radio mesh networks. In cognitive radio networks the behavior of the primary user influences the secondary networks connectivity and the relevant performance. Some primary users may be hidden node and some primary user may be exposed node to the secondary users. The proposed routing schemes can avoid the primary exposed and primary hidden node problem during routing. We propose, a channel priority lists is kept by the secondary users. The secondary users select the channel among the channel priority lists depending on the primary user activity. Therefore it can avoid the end to end reroute procedure due to the exposed or hidden node problem. Throughput and end to end delay is used for the evaluation criteria. Simulation result shows that the proposed routing scheme enhances the network throughput and reduces the end to end delay significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140027/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12507715","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140027/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel spectrum aware routing scheme for multi-hop cognitive radio mesh networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel spectrum aware routing scheme for multi-hop cognitive radio mesh networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p572shamsad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059037S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6140030,"authors":[{"name":"Arshdeep S.

Unlike the previous works that assumed exact circular exclusion regions (or guard zones), we incorporate a sensing mechanism to decrease the significant effect of the nearby interferers. We consider Rayleigh-faded links, large-scale power control, and the knowledge of the initial outages in the absence of the secondary network. We derive an upper bound on the outage probability and show it to be tight when the co-channel primary receivers are separated by relatively significant distances, which is inherently the case for the cellular network. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression that shows the significant impact of the sensing mechanism on the spectrum sharing gains.. Additionally, we optimize the decision threshold, which is used by secondary network users to decide whether to transmit or not, in order to maximize the spectrum sharing gains under the given outage constraints.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140030","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140030.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage in a cellular network overlaid with an ad hoc network: The uplink case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140030/","displayDocTitle":"Outage in a cellular network overlaid with an ad hoc network: The uplink case","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507718","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140030/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage in a cellular network overlaid with an ad hoc network: The uplink case","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p588kahlon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125739S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140031,"authors":[{"name":"Shameek Bhattacharjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shameek","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","id":"38236524900"},{"name":"Saptarshi Debroy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Saptarshi","lastName":"Debroy","id":"37394935900"},{"name":"Mainak Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37278542600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140031","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140031","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Monitoring","Ad hoc networks","Fuses","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly monitoring","distributed cognitive radio networks","spectrum sensing data falsification attack","SSDF attack","malicious nodes","advertised spectrum usage reports","secondary nodes","attack probability","counter-intuitive observation","trust computation","trust based fusion","heuristic trust threshold"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140031","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140031.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust computation through anomaly monitoring in distributed cognitive radio networks","abstract":"The open philosophy of cognitive radio networks makes them vulnerable to various types of attacks which compromises the efficiency of these networks. One such attack is the Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) attack where malicious nodes report false spectrum occupancy data to others which when used leads to inference that is far from the true spectrum occupancy. Thus, there is a need to identify the malicious nodes or at least find the trustworthiness of nodes such that the data sent by malicious nodes could be filtered out. This paper proposes a scheme for trust based fusion by monitoring anomalies in advertised spectrum usage reports by secondary nodes. Such monitoring leads to evaluation of trust of a node by its neighbors. The calculated trust is then used to determine if a neighbor node's advertised data could be used for fusion or not. We provide a heuristic trust threshold for nodes to disregard malicious nodes while fusing the data, which holds good for any probability of attack. To validate our model we conduct extensive simulation experiments. Our results show that majority of the nodes are able to fuse data with greater accuracy for various probabilities or intensities of attack. We also compare our results with blind fusion scheme and observe improvement in accuracy of fusion from individual nodes' as well as overall network's perspective. We also report a very counter-intuitive observation: at lower probabilities of attack, a malicious node's contribution to the overall gain in cooperation is more than the damage done.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140031/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12507719","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140031/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trust computation through anomaly monitoring in distributed cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust computation through anomaly monitoring in distributed cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p593bhattacharjee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056396S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140032,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Khabazian","affiliation":["Qatar University Wireless Innovations Center, Doha, Qatar","INRS, University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Khabazian","id":"37595022900"},{"name":"Sonia A\u00efssa","affiliation":["INRS, University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada","Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, KAUST, Thuwal, KSA"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"A\u00efssa","id":"37273216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140032","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140032","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Queueing analysis","Throughput","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Numerical models","Stability analysis","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","queueing theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","cooperative communications","cognitive radio networks","primary user","secondary user","queuing theory","probability generating functions","performance measure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140032","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140032.pdf","startPage":"598","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and performance analysis of cooperative communications in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In this paper, we study the performance of a network comprised of a primary user and a secondary user with the latter having cognitive radio capabilities.

These primary arrival models have been commonly used for the teletraffic analysis of CRNs in the literature. However, the performance of CRNs under these arrivals models has not been compared in the open literature yet. This is the subject under discussion in this work. In order to provide a fair basis of comparison for the ON/OFF and Poisson arrival models, similar average primary channel occupancy characteristics are considered. Specifically, performance comparison is carried out considering both the same resource utilization factor and the same mean white space duration in both arrival models. In addition, different traffic scenarios (i.e., probability distributions of the channel holding time for primary users) are considered to provide deep insights into the performance behavior of CRNs under these arrival models. Our numerical results show the relevance of the adequate characterization of the primary channel occupancy to accurately evaluate the performance of CRNs. In particular, system performance results obtained with the Poisson model are more pessimistic than those obtained with the ON/OFF model. This is due to the fact that the variance of the white space duration is greater in the Poisson model. Finally, it is observed that performance metrics (i.e., call blocking and forced termination probabilities) for the CRN are practically insensitive to the distribution type of the channel holding time in the primary network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12507722","htmlLink":"/document/6140034/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of cognitive radio networks under ON/OFF and Poisson primary arrival models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of cognitive radio networks under ON/OFF and Poisson primary arrival models","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p609castellanoslopez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083681S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6140035,"authors":[{"name":"Lokman Sboui","affiliation":["Signals and System Department, Tunisia Polytechnic School (EPT), University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Lokman","lastName":"Sboui","id":"38234483900"},{"name":"Zouheir Rezki","affiliation":["Physical Science and Engineering (PSE) Division, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Zouheir","lastName":"Rezki","id":"37294101200"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Physical Science and Engineering (PSE) Division, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140035","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"abstract":"In this paper, we study the ergodic capacity of secondary user channel in a spectrum sharing scenario in which the secondary transmitter is instantaneously aware of estimated versions of the cross link (between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver) and the secondary link Channel State Information (CSI).

In order to gain some insights on the capacity behavior, numerical results are shown for independent Rayleigh fading channels where it is found for instance, that at low SNR regime, only the secondary channel estimation matters and that the cross link CSI has no effect on the ergodic capacity;

In this paper we study the performance of the cognitive network for various cell sizes and transmit power levels when deployed co-located with a mobile primary system that uses a cellular reuse pattern with seven frequencies. Co-location of secondary and primary base stations has been found to be very important in order to reduce network costs. An expression for the degree of co-location of secondary and primary base stations is derived and used for identifying optimal secondary cell sizes. For these optimal secondary cell sizes, we determine the performance in terms of throughput, packet loss, delay, coverage and connectivity when using spectrum holes in the space, time and frequency domains. Especially, we find that cell size and transmit power levels are crucial for secondary system performance, and that smaller cell sizes and less expensive base stations for the secondary system such as WiFi access points and femto-cells is beneficial.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12507727","htmlLink":"/document/6140039/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a Sensor Network Aided Cognitive Radio system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a Sensor Network Aided Cognitive Radio system","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p629grnsund.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132041S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6140041,"authors":[{"name":"Luxmiram Vijayandran","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Luxmiram","lastName":"Vijayandran","id":"37392255500"},{"name":"Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Optical Communications Research Group, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Prathapasinghe","lastName":"Dharmawansa","id":"37541394300"},{"name":"Torbj\u00f6rn Ekman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Torbj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ekman","id":"37318026000"},{"name":"Chinthananda Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada","Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Chinthananda","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37069241900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140041","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","digital television","probability","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aggregate interference","finite area cognitive radio networks","interference management","primary user","performance evaluation","outage probability","bit error rate","finite reconfigurable model","IEEE 802.22 digital TV scenario","WRAN digital TV scenario","moment generating function","MGF"]}],"abstract":"Interference management is a major issue in underlay cognitive radio networks.

In contrast, we investigate the more realistic finite area, and further consider various practical spatial configurations. Two of the possible applications the proposed finite reconfigurable model can advocate are the IEEE 802.22 (WRAN) digital TV scenario and the aggregate interference considering different path loss exponents. We first derive the exact moment generating function (MGF) of the interference, then quantify the mean, the variance, and the skewness. Subsequently, the primary system performances are evaluated leading to novel expressions based on the interference MGF.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140041","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140041.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140041","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","startPage":"640","endPage":"644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggregate interference and system performance in finite area cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Aggregate interference and system performance in finite area cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140041/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140041/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507729","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregate interference and system performance in finite area cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p640vijayandran.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084864S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140044,"authors":[{"name":"Jayaprakash Rajasekharan","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Signal Processing Laboratory, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jayaprakash","lastName":"Rajasekharan","id":"38073468200"},{"name":"Jan Eriksson","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Signal Processing Laboratory, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Eriksson","id":"37273830800"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Signal Processing Laboratory, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140044","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":392},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Sensors","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative game theory","spectrum allocation","cognitive radio","spectrum sharing","secondary users","transferable utility cooperative game","Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism","primary user"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of spectrum sharing in cognitive radios where secondary users (SUs) cooperatively sense the spectrum for identifying and accessing unoccupied spectrum bands.

SUs form coalitions to jointly sense the spectrum. The worth of each SU is calculated according to the work done for the coalition in terms of the information obtained about primary user (PU) activity from sensing the spectrum. The resulting games are balanced and superadditive and each SU gets a pay-off according to her worth in the coalition. Depending upon their spectrum needs, SUs use this pay-off to bid for unoccupied bands of spectrum through an VCG auction. VCG auction mechanism provides SUs with an incentive to bid truthfully according to their demand and is socially optimal.

We thus propose an iterative algorithm to determine the BF vectors for the secondary transmission. The optimization of the Lagrange multipliers involved in the optimization problem is based on the subgradient method. The expression of the BF vector can be interpreted as dual Uplink (UL) MMSE receiver that takes into account the interference caused by a fictitious link between the primary user and secondary base station. Finally Deterministic Annealing is applied to make the convergence of the algorithm easier.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140045","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140045.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted sum rate maximization in the underlay cognitive MISO Interference Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140045/","displayDocTitle":"Weighted sum rate maximization in the underlay cognitive MISO Interference Channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507733","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140045/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted sum rate maximization in the underlay cognitive MISO Interference Channel","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p661gallo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048678S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6140050,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Li","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Li","id":"37539236100"},{"name":"Philemon Ivan Derwin","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"lastName":"Philemon Ivan Derwin","id":"38234439900"},{"name":"Marius Pesavento","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Pesavento","id":"37285062000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140050","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference","Binary phase shift keying","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio links","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","scheduling","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol error rate analysis","multiuser underlay cognitive radio system","secondary transmitter","secondary receiver","primary receiver","data transmission","peak interference","fading state","link reliability","opportunistic scheduling","numerical simulation","error floor region","fixed interference constraint"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140050","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140050","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","abstract":"We consider an underlay cognitive radio system consisting of a secondary transmitter (ST), K secondary receivers (SRs) and a primary receiver (PR). Data transmission is granted to the ST under the constraint that the generated peak interference to the PR is below a predetermined interference temperature level. Assuming that the ST can adaptively adjust its transmit power according to the fading state of the channel, our objective is to analyze the link reliability in terms of the symbol error rate (SER). In particular, we derive the exact SER expressions under the assumption that opportunistic scheduling is applied at the ST, where the SR with the highest channel gain is exclusively selected for data transmission. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the obtained SER expressions. Our results show that there exists an error floor region due to the interference constraint, i.e., the SER approaches to a certain constant as the allowed peak transmit power threshold increases. Moreover, we show that opportunistic scheduling can improve the SER performance under a fixed interference constraint.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","startPage":"681","endPage":"684","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140050.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol error rate analysis in multiuser underlay cognitive radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6140050/","displayDocTitle":"Symbol error rate analysis in multiuser underlay cognitive radio systems","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507738","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol error rate analysis in multiuser underlay cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p681li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078506S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140052,"authors":[{"name":"Mikio Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikio","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37270352600"},{"name":"Kentaro Ishizu","affiliation":["Smart Wireless Laboratory, NICT, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kentaro","lastName":"Ishizu","id":"37283847400"},{"name":"Homare Murakami","affiliation":["Smart Wireless Laboratory, NICT, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Homare","lastName":"Murakami","id":"37270645100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Harada","affiliation":["Smart Wireless Laboratory, NICT, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37276707400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140052","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Wireless networks","Radio access networks","Neurons","Quality of service","Throughput","NIST"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","optimisation","radio access networks","telecommunication computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic heterogeneous wireless networks","distributed radio resource usage optimization","distributed radio access network","base stations","noncognitive legacy terminals","mutually-connected neural networks","higher-order neural networks","nonuniform heterogeneous wireless network","complex optimization problems","legacy noncognitive terminals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","heterogeneous wireless networks","cognitive radio","optimization","neural networks","radio resource management"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140052","abstract":"This paper investigates effectiveness of distributed radio access network (RAN) selection schemes to optimize radio resource usage, for the realistic heterogeneous wireless networks, in which the distribution of the base stations are non-uniform and the non-cognitive legacy terminals also connect to the same RANs.

Unlike traditional centralized reconstruction, in this paper, we centralized recover the spectrums by exploiting the block-sparsity which is rather prevalent in multi-band signals. In DCS, first each CR samples the signals with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate independently, then the sampled data are uploaded to the fusion center (FC), finally FC reconstructs these data simultaneously. To exploit the block-sparsity, two new centralized recovery algorithms simultaneous block orthogonal matching pursuit (S-BOMP) and simultaneous binary tree based block orthogonal matching pursuit (S-BTBOMP) are developed. Simulation results show they outperform existing simultaneous recovery algorithms which don't take block-sparsity into consideration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140053.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"699","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed compressed sensing for block-sparse signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Compressed sensing","Sensors","Fading","Wideband","Signal to noise ratio","Binary trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressed sensing","fading channels","iterative methods","radio receivers","signal reconstruction","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed compressed sensing","block-sparse signal","shadow fading","additive noise","DCS","spatial diversity","fading channel","multiband signal","CR sample","subNyquist sampling rate","fusion center","FC","simultaneous block orthogonal matching pursuit","S-BOMP","simultaneous binary tree based block orthogonal matching pursuit","S-BTBOMP","distributed compressed sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","distributed compressed sensing","block-sparsity","simultaneous recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed compressed sensing for block-sparse signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140053/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507741","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed compressed sensing for block-sparse signals","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p695wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073427S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6140054,"authors":[{"name":"Soumya Das","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Soumya","lastName":"Das","id":"38106067900"},{"name":"Peerapol Tinnakornsrisuphap","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Peerapol","lastName":"Tinnakornsrisuphap","id":"37268976100"},{"name":"David Ott","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ott","id":"37282326400"},{"name":"Samir S.

Beside the detection and estimation methods, spectrum sensing procedures can also benefit from the modeling and prediction of the wireless spectrum usage. Markovian, regressive and other approaches are introduced for time or frequency domain channel modeling however, the research on the spectrum allocation methods indicates that location information has also an important influence on the spectrum occupancy characterization. In this paper, linear autoregressive prediction approach for binary time series is employed to investigate channel occupancy prediction performance based on spectrum measurements conducted in four different locations synchronously. Through the modeling procedure, dependency in frequency domain is also taken into consideration by modeling the adjacent frequency bands together. The model order is selected based on mean residual magnitudes and Akaike information criterion, mode order parameters are tabulated, and comparative prediction analysis considering the observation time is given for each location. The performance of the proposed linear modeling method is also compared with continuous-time Markov chain modeling in one of the locations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507744","htmlLink":"/document/6140056/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An autoregressive approach for spectrum occupancy modeling and prediction based on synchronous measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An autoregressive approach for spectrum occupancy modeling and prediction based on synchronous measurements","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p705gorcin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069411S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140057,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Qing","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Huang Qing","id":"37605474400"},{"name":"Xu Shaoyi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xu Shaoyi","id":"38234485100"},{"name":"Jin Xiaojun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jin Xiaojun","id":"37297619800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140057","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Delay","Buffer storage","Vehicle dynamics","Bandwidth","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","broadcast channels","cognitive radio","mathematical analysis","performance evaluation","probability","queueing theory","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","dynamic spectrum access system","licensed wireless spectrum","broadcast bands","spectrum scarcity problem","spectrum usage","licensed bands","cognitive radio system","licensed system","bandwidth","finite buffer","preempted secondary users","secondary usersservices","delay-loss multichannel preemptive priority queuing model","mathematical analysis","secondary system performance","forced termination probability","blocking probability","preempted probability","waiting time","system delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","cognitive radio","Markov","proformance"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio/Dynamic Spectrum Access, which intelligently and opportunistically uses underutilized portions of licensed wireless spectrum such as broadcast bands, has been proposed to effectively address spectrum scarcity problem. However, the dynamics of spectrum usage in licensed bands influences the performances of cognitive radio system because the licensed system takes priority over the cognitive radio system. In this paper, a cognitive radio system is analyzed with the primary users and the secondary users sharing different bandwidth and a scheme is proposed in which a finite buffer is used to store the preempted secondary users to avoid forced termination of the secondary user's services. A delay-loss multi-channel preemptive priority queuing model is developed and mathematical analysis was presented to study the secondary system performance in terms of forced termination probability, blocking probability, preempted probability and waiting time. Numerical results show that the forced termination is totally eliminated at the price of increasing the delay of the system.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140057","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140057.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140057","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","startPage":"710","endPage":"714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of secondary users in Dynamic Spectrum Access system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of secondary users in Dynamic Spectrum Access system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140057/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140057/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507745","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of secondary users in Dynamic Spectrum Access system","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p710qing.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050069S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140060,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Laboratories (China), Research and Innovation Center, Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Tao Yang","id":"37714294100"},{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Laboratories (China), Research and Innovation Center, Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Lu Zhang","id":"37406068900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140060","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Interference","Real time systems","Macrocell networks","Propagation losses","Loss measurement","Standardization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous power control","co-channel deployment","macrocell","femtocell","downlink interference","user equipments","DL power control","primary inter-cell interference cancelation","3GPP standardization","autonomous parameter-estimation"]}],"abstract":"For co-channel deployment of Macrocell and indoor Femtocell, in order to mitigate downlink (DL) interference toward user equipments (UEs) of Macrocell, DL power control (PC) at Femto has been considered as the primary inter-cell interference cancelation (ICIC) strategy in 3GPP standardization. Further, currently, the 3GPP-agreed baseline for backhaul is that there is no direct X2/S1 interface between Macrocell and Femtocell, which means the real-time Macro-Femto coordination does not exist. Thus, autonomous triggering of Femto DL ICIC and autonomous PC at Femto have been recommended in 3GPP standardization. In this paper, to enhance the feasibility and performance of Femto's autonomous PC, we firstly design a strategy for Femto to properly determine the self-configured threshold used to autonomously trigger DL ICIC. Then, more importantly, to improve the autonomous parameter-estimation approaches used for implementing autonomous PC at Femto, an effective strategy is designed for Femto to autonomously estimate whether there exists at least one indoor victim Macro UE (MUE). Simulations show that the proposed strategies work well and provide obviously enhanced ICIC benefit for the focused autonomous Femto PC scheme.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140060","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140060.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaches to enhancing autonomous power control at Femto under co-channel deployment of Macrocell and Femtocell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140060/","displayDocTitle":"Approaches to enhancing autonomous power control at Femto under co-channel deployment of Macrocell and Femtocell","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507748","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140060/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaches to enhancing autonomous power control at Femto under co-channel deployment of Macrocell and Femtocell","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p71yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04481S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6140065,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Hsiang Wang","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hung-Hsiang Wang","id":"38240083800"},{"name":"Hsin-An Hou","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-An Hou","id":"37401375600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140065","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140065","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Antenna measurements","Throughput","Delay","Global Positioning System","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","Global Positioning System","railway communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed railway communication","broadband high-mobility communication","high speed railway system","beamforming platform","transmitter antenna","Taiwan high speed railway","THSR","received signal strength indicator","RSSI","carrier to interference plus noise ratio","CINR","real time receiver Global Positioning System information","real time receiver GPS information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-Speed Railway","Route-Tracking Beamforming","Global Positioning System (GPS)","Path Loss Model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140065","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140065.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental analysis of beamforming in high-speed railway communication","abstract":"The demand of broadband high-mobility communication increased dramatically with the rapid development of high speed railway system.

The use of IM/DD technique inherently eliminates the problem of carrier frequency offset. Therefore, time-frequency synchronisation in optical OFDM system reduces to frame synchronisation and sampling clock synchronisation. Sampling clock offset causes irreducible intercarrier interference (ICI) and symbol timing offset. A technique to mitigate the impact of sampling clock offset is proposed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the received signal is oversampled at twice the Nyquist rate and the odd samples are punctured. The symbol timing offset is estimated using pilots and when the symbol timing offset exceeds \u00b10.5 of sample duration, the puncturing pattern flips between puncturing the odd series and the even series. This in effect, constraints the symbol timing offset within \u00b11 sample duration. The residual symbol offset can be perfectly corrected using linear phase equaliser. The results show that the proposed method attains a performance comparable to the system that is ideally synchronised provided that the sampling clock offset is lower than 50 ppm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time and frequency synchronisation in optical wireless OFDM networks","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140080","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140080.pdf","startPage":"819","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Time and frequency synchronisation in optical wireless OFDM networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140080/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507768","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time and frequency synchronisation in optical wireless OFDM networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p819ghimire.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087501S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6140082,"authors":[{"name":"Yoann Corre","affiliation":["Radio Department, SIRADEL S.A.S., Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Yoann","lastName":"Corre","id":"37268844500"},{"name":"Julien Stephan","affiliation":["Radio Department, SIRADEL S.A.S., Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Stephan","id":"38241695400"},{"name":"Yves Lostanlen","affiliation":["Wireless Expertise and Research Center, SIRADEL, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Lostanlen","id":"37268822600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140082","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1083},"abstract":"Two different indoor-to-outdoor path-loss models are proposed in this paper: an analytical formula derived for link-level and system-level simulations in heterogeneous radio networks, and a ray-tracing based model providing deterministic path-loss predictions, helpful for precise radio analysis or radio-planning tasks.

With rising requirements it becomes more expensive to provide components with sufficient linearity. Especially in the receiver, where out-of-band radiation is not an issue, relaxing the requirements on the analog components could significantly reduce development and production costs as well as increase the energy efficiency. There are numerous algorithms to mitigate the effects caused by nonlinearities. This paper presents a method for the blind estimation of nonlinearity parameters which can be applied to a large class of nonlinearities. The estimator is integrated in an OFDM system with nonlinearity mitigation and it shows that there is negligible performance degradation compared to perfect knowledge. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived and it is shown that the estimator reaches it in the high SNR region. Special care was taken to provide a solution with low computational complexity that can be readily implemented on current platforms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140083.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"833","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind estimation and mitigation of nonlinear channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Transforms","Vectors","Maximum likelihood estimation","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind estimation","nonlinear channels mitigation","nonlinear distortions","out-of-band radiation","energy efficiency","nonlinearity parameters","OFDM system","Cramer-Rao lower bound","performance degradation","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Blind estimation and mitigation of nonlinear channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140083/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507771","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind estimation and mitigation of nonlinear channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p829dohl.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048239S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6140087,"authors":[{"name":"Eng Hwee Ong","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Helsinki, Finland"],"lastName":"Eng Hwee Ong","id":"37653341300"},{"name":"Jarkko Kneckt","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarkko","lastName":"Kneckt","id":"37706597400"},{"name":"Olli Alanen","affiliation":["Magister Solutions Limited, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Olli","lastName":"Alanen","id":"37304219600"},{"name":"Zheng Chang","affiliation":["Magister Solutions Limited, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"38236304200"},{"name":"Toni Huovinen","affiliation":["Magister Solutions Limited, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Huovinen","id":"37426221000"},{"name":"Timo Nihtil\u00e4","affiliation":["Magister Solutions Limited, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Nihtil\u00e4","id":"37313351200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140087","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":6527},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Numerical models","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Throughput","Bandwidth","Training","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","computer network performance evaluation","numerical analysis","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11ac","very high throughput WLAN","VHT WLAN standard","PHY data rates","numerical analysis","numerical simulation","frame aggregation mechanism","aggregate MAC service data unit","aggregate MAC protocol data unit","hybrid A-MSDU-A-MPDU aggregation","spatial streams"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE 802.11ac is an emerging very high throughput (VHT) WLAN standard that could achieve PHY data rates of close to 7 Gbps for the 5 GHz band.

According to these standard specifications, a MATLAB code has been used to generate the channel model for simulations. The same code representing the channel impulse response has been imported to a radio channel emulator to imitate the wireless channel behavior for the laboratory measurements. For the proposed transceiver operating in the frequency range (3.1-4.1GHz), single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and MIMO configurations have been considered. A comparative study between standard channel models (CM) 1 and 4 is presented for each scenario. The results demonstrate a significant performance enhancement when an extra branch is used at the receiver of the SIMO, MIMO systems. This is due to the advantage of added diversity obtained in multiple-output systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","accessionNumber":"12507782","htmlLink":"/document/6140094/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"OFDM-UWB MIMO transceiver implementation in realistic fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM-UWB MIMO transceiver implementation in realistic fading channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p879aljerjawi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074922S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6140107,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Quitin","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium","ICTEAM, Electrical Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Quitin","id":"37319785800"},{"name":"Claude Oestges","affiliation":["ICTEAM, Electrical Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Belgium"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Oestges","id":"37278300500"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Bellens","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Bellens","id":"38315269400"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane van Roy","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"van Roy","id":"37670943100"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Horlin","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Horlin","id":"37268157100"},{"name":"Philippe De Doncker","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"De Doncker","id":"37319019000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140107","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"abstract":"In previous work, it has been observed that the specular and the diffuse component are linked in the angular domain.

Both nomadic and mobile node scenarios are considered and compared. Empirical models are eventually derived. Our analysis reveals that the average separation between two MIMO links sharing a joint transmitter is usually lower in mobile scenarios than in nomadic scenarios, and is strongly related to the spatial correlation of the individual MIMO links. However, there appears to be no relationship between the correlation matrix distance and the shadowing correlation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140108.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"949","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical investigation of multi-link separation for indoor MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","MIMO","Mobile communication","Shadow mapping","Fading","Peer to peer computing","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","indoor radio","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","mobile radio","radio links","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilink separation","indoor MIMO channel","multinode multiantenna channel measurement","multiwall office environment","MIMO links","correlation matrix distance","shadowing correlation","nomadic scenario","mobile node scenario","joint transmitter","spatial correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Empirical investigation of multi-link separation for indoor MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140108/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507796","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical investigation of multi-link separation for indoor MIMO channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p945oestges.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056531S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6140109,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyi Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"lastName":"Xiaoyi Zhu","id":"37536984800"},{"name":"Angela Doufexi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Doufexi","id":"37276844100"},{"name":"Taskin Kocak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Taskin","lastName":"Kocak","id":"38266211600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140109","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1041},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","OFDM","MIMO","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless personal area networks","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","performance evaluation","personal area networks","space division multiplexing","space-time block codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","MIMO systems","IEEE 802.11ad WPAN","millimeter-wave wireless communications","multiple-input multiple-output techniques","wireless personal networks","packet error rate","space-time block codes","STBC","spatial multiplexing","SM","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WPAN","60 GHz","IEEE 802.11ad","OFDM","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE 802.11ad task group has published its first draft to cope with the characteristics in 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communications.

The fast fading can destroy the orthogonality of subcarriers and cause serious InterCarrier Interference (ICI), thus leading to significant performance degradation that becomes severe as Doppler shift increases. To tackle this problem, a frequency domain iterative ICI mitigation algorithm is mathematically derived. By fully exploiting the separation property of Channel Transfer Function (CTF) matrix, ICI can be iteratively subtracted from received symbols and then Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) detection is performed to suppress multistream interference among different antennas. In particular, the complexity of the proposed strategy can be drastically reduced by restricting the interference computation to limited eighteen adjacent subcarriers, whereas the performance loss is quite minor. Simulation results illustrate that this scheme can effectively alleviate the impairment of ICI and asymptotically approach the ICI free performance at low-to-moderate Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140111.pdf","startPage":"959","endPage":"963","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative InterCarrier Interference mitigation for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Equalizers","Doppler shift","Complexity theory","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","iterative methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","iterative intercarrier interference mitigation","multicarrier transmission","time varying frequency selective fading channels","multiple input multiple output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","subcarrier orthogonality","Doppler shift","frequency domain algorithm","channel transfer function matrix","parallel interference cancellation","multistream interference suppression","adjacent subcarriers","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Iterative InterCarrier Interference mitigation for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140111/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507799","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative InterCarrier Interference mitigation for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p959zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060904S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140113,"authors":[{"name":"Feng-Seng Chu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Feng-Seng Chu","id":"37712324300"},{"name":"Kwang-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kwang-Cheng Chen","id":"37278248500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1347-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"6140113","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Minimization","Energy consumption","Resource management","Complexity theory","Benchmark testing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient OFDMA","transmission energy","wireless communications","energy consumption","reduced-complexity algorithm","resource allocation","computation energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","Energy efficiency","Routing","Resource allocation","Relay"]}],"abstract":"We study minimization of overall energy consumption of OFDMA systems, which are widely adopted in future wireless communications. Based on the existing resource allocation to minimize transmission energy, the computation energy increases due to the complexity of allocating algorithms. Since high performance algorithms usually have high complexity, there exist trade-offs between transmission energy and computation energy. To systematically minimize overall energy consumption comprised of transmission and computation, we propose to minimize transmission energy by resource allocation while keeping the computation energy low via reduced-complexity algorithm. We further extend this idea to relay since it is well known to reduce transmission energy but only a few of works to minimize total energy consumption. In our numerical results, we demonstrate that in the scenario without relay, our algorithm can achieve near-minimum transmission energy (80% savings) under quite computation energy. In the scenario with relay, our algorithm can do even better by saving more transmission energy (88% savings) under a minor increase of computation energy. Both scenarios suggest that the global energy minimum can be achieved by proper trade-off between communication and computation energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140113","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126164/6139643/06140113.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139643","startPage":"96","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient OFDMA: Trade-off between computation and transmission energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient OFDMA: Trade-off between computation and transmission energy","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140113/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507801","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6140113/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient OFDMA: Trade-off between computation and transmission energy","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p96chu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060345S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6126164","isNumber":"6139643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6126164","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6139643","articleId":"6140113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6140115,"authors":[{"name":"Ponnu Jacob","affiliation":["Centre of Multimedia and Network Technology, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ponnu","lastName":"Jacob","id":"38241572900"},{"name":"A.S.

Many efforts have been done to save energy: MAC with duty cycle, energy-aware routing protocols, data aggregation schemes, etc. Recently, beacon-less strategies have emerged as new direction to improve considerably the WSN lifetime. However, the main contributions are not suitable to real radio environments because of hole avoiding strategies based on either planarization or explicit neighbor solicitations. We propose PFMAC (Pizza-Forwarding Medium Access Control), which combines beacon-less geo-routing and energy efficient MAC protocol via a cross-layer design to save more energy with higher reliability. PFMAC supports radio interferences, asymmetric radio links, etc. PFMAC supports a greedy forwarding strategy and, a reactive and optimized neighborhood discovery at 2-hop to deal with holes.

This manuscript investigates the damping performance of the Static Var Compensator (SVC) equipped with an auxiliary controller based on Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). First of all, a modified Heffron-Phillips model of the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system installed with SVC is established. In the following an auxiliary fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for SVC is designed to enhance the transient stability of the power system. Next, an ANFIS based auxiliary damping controller is well-designed and compared with the FLC. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed ANFIS based controller in damping of LFO, the SMIB power system is subjected to a disturbance such as changes in mechanical power. The complete digital simulations are performed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment to provide comprehensive understanding of the issue. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed ANFIS based controller would be more effective in damping electromechanical oscillations in comparison with the FLC and conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller.","startPage":"I-80","endPage":"I-84","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132475/6140121/06140145.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power oscillations damping by Static Var Compensator using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power oscillations damping by Static Var Compensator using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy controller","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140145/","accessionNumber":"12495726","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140145/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power oscillations damping by Static Var Compensator using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy controller","confLoc":"Bursa, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056475S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132475","isNumber":"6140121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6140121","articleId":"6140145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chamber of Turkish Electric","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140172,"authors":[{"name":"Dogan D.

The algorithm employs three specially designed multi-state cellular neural networks (CNNs) connected in cascade. Analysis of 106 high-resolution images from 23 women acquired using a 3T MR scanner shows that the algorithm is exceptionally effective with high precision, high true-positive volume fraction, and low false-positive volume fraction with an overall performance of 99.1\u00b12.0%, 99.4\u00b11.4%, and 0.1\u00b10.2%, respectively. The use of multi-state CNN reduces the false segmentations on the images due to noise, intensity inhomogeneity and partial volume artifacts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140172/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12495753","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140172/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of breast region from MR images using multi-state cellular neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of breast region from MR images using multi-state cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Bursa, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059054S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132475","isNumber":"6140121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6140121","articleId":"6140172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chamber of Turkish Electric","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6140173,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, biometric technology applies complex, compute-intensive image processing algorithms which demand to be executed on powerful computers for acceptable processing times. This prevents biometric systems to be used in applications that require low-cost embedded solutions. This paper presents a novel approach to personal verification that utilizes infrared finger vein biometrics implemented in an FPGA-based System-on-Chip platform. To improve performance, we apply the hardware-software co-design approach, using hardware acceleration for the image preprocessing tasks and image buffer management while leaving feature extraction and template matching to software. The system is prototyped on an Altera Nios2 FPGA development board running the Nios2-Linux RTOS at 100MHz clock. The proposed finger vein biometric system achieves a matching accuracy of EER (average) of 0.08% and a verification processing time of 1.27 seconds, demonstrating that the design approach taken can be effective for embedded vein biometric authentication system.","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132475/6140121/06140173.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140121","startPage":"II-171","endPage":"II-176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personal verification using finger vein biometrics in FPGA-based System-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Personal verification using finger vein biometrics in FPGA-based System-on-Chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140173/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12495754","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6140173/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personal verification using finger vein biometrics in FPGA-based System-on-Chip","confLoc":"Bursa, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10654S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132475","isNumber":"6140121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6140121","articleId":"6140173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chamber of Turkish Electric","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140175,"authors":[{"name":"Halit Oztekin","affiliation":["Institute of Science Technology, Computer Engineering Dep, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey","Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bozok University, Yozgat, Turkey"],"firstName":"Halit","lastName":"Oztekin","id":"37546073700"},{"name":"Feyzullah Temurtas","affiliation":["Institute of Science Technology, Computer Engineering Dep, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Feyzullah","lastName":"Temurtas","id":"37546074200"},{"name":"Ali Gulbag","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bozok University, Yozgat, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Gulbag","id":"37546077400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-6-0501-0090-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0160-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-605-01-0204-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6140175","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"abstract":"An important problem in Computer Architecture and Organization course is the migration from theory to practice.

In this work, a single layer reflectarray unit cell is designed by using Minkowski shape radiating element. The reflection phase of unit cell is simulated varying geometric parameters of patch and substrate thickness within range 10-12 (GHz). After that Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN) is carried out to predict the phase characterization of reflected wave.

We perform optimization in an augmented-Lagrangian framework, which decouples the difficult \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n-dimensional constrained-optimization problem into a sequence of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n easier scalar unconstrained problems that we solve efficiently via traditional wavelet shrinkage. Our method can handle arbitrary gradient-based regularizers. In particular, it can be made to adhere to the popular principle of least total variation. It can also be used as a maximum a posteriori estimator for a variety of priors. We illustrate the performance of our method for image denoising and for the statistical estimation of sparse stochastic processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140548/","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6140548/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12524106","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Shrinkage With Consistent Cycle Spinning Generalizes Total Variation Denoising","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Shrinkage With Consistent Cycle Spinning Generalizes Total Variation Denoising","sourcePdf":"lsp-kamilov-2185929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054303S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6145223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6145223","articleId":"6140548","onlineDate":"27 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6140553,"authors":[{"name":"A.

DisPATCh converts soil temperature fields into soil moisture fields given a semi-empirical soil evaporative efficiency model and a first-order Taylor series expansion around the field-mean soil moisture. In this study, the disaggregation approach is applied to Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite data over the 500 km by 100 km Australian Airborne Calibration/validation Experiments for SMOS (AACES) area. The 40-km resolution SMOS surface soil moisture pixels are disaggregated at 1-km resolution using the soil skin temperature derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and subsequently compared with the AACES intensive ground measurements aggregated at 1-km resolution. The objective is to test DisPATCh under various surface and atmospheric conditions. It is found that the accuracy of disaggregation products varies greatly according to season: while the correlation coefficient between disaggregated and in situ soil moisture is about 0.7 during the summer AACES, it is approximately zero during the winter AACES, consistent with a weaker coupling between evaporation and surface soil moisture in temperate than in semi-arid climate. Moreover, during the summer AACES, the correlation coefficient between disaggregated and in situ soil moisture is increased from 0.70 to 0.85, by separating the 1-km pixels where MODIS temperature is mainly controlled by soil evaporation, from those where MODIS temperature is controlled by both soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration. It is also found that the 5-km resolution atmospheric correction of the official MODIS temperature data has a significant impact on DisPATCh output. An alternative atmospheric correction at 40-km resolution increases the correlation coefficient between disaggregated and in situ soil moisture from 0.72 to 0.82 during the summer AACES. Results indicate that DisPATCh has a strong potential in low-vegetated semi-arid areas where it can be used as a tool to evaluate SMOS data (by reducing the mismatch in spatial extent between SMOS observations and localized in situ measurements), and as a further step, to derive a 1-km resolution soil moisture product adapted for large-scale hydrological studies.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2175000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2175000","startPage":"1556","endPage":"1571","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6186863/06140561.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disaggregation of SMOS Soil Moisture in Southeastern Australia","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Disaggregation of SMOS Soil Moisture in Southeastern Australia","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","volume":"50","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140561/","accessionNumber":"12691989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140561/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disaggregation of SMOS Soil Moisture in Southeastern Australia","sourcePdf":"tgrs-merlin-2175000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168806S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6186863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6186863","articleId":"6140561","onlineDate":"27 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":6140562,"authors":[{"name":"Lele Qu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Shenyang AeroSpace University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6243179/6140562/6140562-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lele Qu received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Insitute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2010.","He is currently with the School of Electronic Information Engineering, Shenyang Aerospace Univerisity, Shenyang, China.

The intrinsic sparseness of target space offers a migration imaging method to make the high-quality image of underground region based on compressive sensing (CS) theory. In this paper, the effects of air/ground interface and antenna beamwidth on CS-based SFCW GPR migration imaging are presented and analyzed. It is shown that the presence of the strong air/ground interface reflection and finite antenna beamwidth usually challenges the robust CS migration imaging algorithm in practice. To overcome this problem in the context of CS migration imaging, an improved CS migration imaging method for SFCW GPR system is proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that the approach is robust to deliver a high-quality image of underground region.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6243179/06140562.pdf","startPage":"3143","endPage":"3149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2179049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2179049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6243179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Air/Ground Reflection and Antenna Beamwidth for Compressive Sensing SFCW GPR Migration Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency measurement","Ground penetrating radar","Antennas","Antenna measurements","Thyristors","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical equipment","geophysical image processing","ground penetrating radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air reflection investigation","ground reflection investigation","Antenna Beamwidth","SFCW GPR migration imaging","stepped frequency continuous wave","ground penetrating radar","point-like scatters","target space image pixels","high-quality image","compressive sensing theory","air-ground interface","antenna beamwidth","CS migration imaging","SFCW GPR system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Air/ground reflection","antenna beamwidth","compressive sensing","ground penetrating radar (GPR)","stepped frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Air/Ground Reflection and Antenna Beamwidth for Compressive Sensing SFCW GPR Migration Imaging","volume":"50","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6140562/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12866537","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Air/Ground Reflection and Antenna Beamwidth for Compressive Sensing SFCW GPR Migration Imaging","sourcePdf":"tgrs-qu-2179049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106151S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6243179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6243179","articleId":"6140562","onlineDate":"27 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6140564,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Savaghebi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, the Center of Excellence for Power System Automation and Operation, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6361304/6140564/6140564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Savaghebi (S'06) was born in Karaj, Iran, in 1983.

The DGs are properly controlled to autonomously compensate for voltage unbalance while sharing the compensation effort and also active and reactive powers. The control system of the DGs mainly consists of active and reactive power droop controllers, a virtual impedance loop, voltage and current controllers, and an unbalance compensator.

The parasitic ringing caused by different parasitic effects is analyzed. Two different methods, the use of an RC snubber and the use of suppression ferrite component, are investigated for dampening the parasitic oscillations. It is found that applying a ferrite bead not only dampens the parasitic oscillations, but also results in significantly lower switching losses. Furthermore, it is shown that the capacitive coupling between SiC devices in the bridge leg and heat sinks significantly deteriorates the JFETs' switching performance. The effect of two substrates, an insulated metal substrate and a printed circuit board, on the capacitive coupling is investigated. A method in which the use of two separate heat spreaders minimizes the capacitive coupling, thus, exploiting the full potential of fast SiC JFETs is proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving SiC JFET Switching Behavior Under Influence of Circuit Parasitics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2185951","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6184677/06140582.pdf","startPage":"3843","endPage":"3854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2185951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6184677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Improving SiC JFET Switching Behavior Under Influence of Circuit Parasitics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6140582/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12670072","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving SiC JFET Switching Behavior Under Influence of Circuit Parasitics","sourcePdf":"tpel-josifovic-2185951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078203S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6184677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6184677","articleId":"6140582","onlineDate":"27 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6140589,"authors":[{"name":"Chenyuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6169213/6140589/6140589-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenyuan Wang received the B.A.Sc. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2009.

In contrast to the existing literature, which assumes perfect self-interference cancellation, we consider imperfect self-interference cancellation at both sources that exchange information through multiple relays, and maximal-ratio combining is then applied to improve the decision statistics under imperfect signal detection. We derive the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) subject to noisy channel estimation, and based on this SNR, the system outage probability is given. In addition, we derive the closed-form expression of the average system bit error rate (BER) and the asymptotic expressions for both outage probability and BER. Furthermore, instead of employing all relays, we examine the impact of imperfect CSI on a single relay selection (RS) scheme. To mitigate the negative impact of imperfect CSI, we show that power allocation (PA), by minimizing either the outage probability or the BER, can suitably be cast as the geometric-programming problem. Numerical results validate the correctness of the derived expressions and show that the adaptive-PA scheme outperforms the equal-PA scheme under the aggregated effect of imperfect CSI.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2185964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6169213/06140589.pdf","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2185964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Channel Estimation Error on the Performance of Amplify-and-Forward Two-Way Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Channel Estimation Error on the Performance of Amplify-and-Forward Two-Way Relaying","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140589/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592444","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Channel Estimation Error on the Performance of Amplify-and-Forward Two-Way Relaying","sourcePdf":"tvt-dong-2185964-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148429S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6169213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6169213","articleId":"6140589","onlineDate":"27 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6140596,"authors":[{"name":"Pere L.

While this line of research is now mature enough to be built into demonstrative working systems for scenarios involving a (limited) passive/eavesdropping adversary model, the case of an active (jamming) adversary has not been sufficiently studied. Under an active adversary, information-bits that need to be exchanged during the process of key setup will not only be subject to eavesdropping, but also message disruptions that could lead to a high communication cost per bit of secret key generated. Measuring efficiency of key exchange as the ratio of communication cost to the size of secret key generated, in this paper, we address the following question: Is generating a secret key by exploiting wireless fading an efficient process? We obtain analytical results that quantify the minimum number of information-bits that must be exchanged to obtain one bit of shared secret key and show that this number rapidly increases with an active adversary's signal power. Thus, through our analysis, we conclude that the effectiveness of generating a secret key from wireless fading is limited when considering active adversaries.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Wireless communication","Protocols","Communication system security","Security","Random variables","Jamming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","private key cryptography","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secret key generation","wireless fading channel","active adversary model","information-theoretic shared secret key","passive-eavesdropping adversary model","communication cost ratio","information-bits","active adversary signal power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active adversary","channel fading","jamming","secret key","wireless security"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNET.2012.2183146","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6329526/06140616.pdf","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6329526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2012.2183146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations of Generating a Secret Key Using Wireless Fading Under Active Adversary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Limitations of Generating a Secret Key Using Wireless Fading Under Active Adversary","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140616/","volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140616/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13039039","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations of Generating a Secret Key Using Wireless Fading Under Active Adversary","sourcePdf":"tnet-zafer-2183146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109802S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6329526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6329526","articleId":"6140616","onlineDate":"27 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6140618,"authors":[{"name":"Rabih A.

This formulation has two features: first, it employs a convex representation of the network model which is based on the conic quadratic format of the power flow equations and second, it optimizes the exact value of the network losses. The use of a convex model in terms of the continuous variables is particularly important because it ensures that an optimal solution obtained by a branch-and-cut algorithm for mixed-integer conic programming is global. In addition, good quality solutions with a relaxed optimality gap can be very efficiently obtained. A polyhedral approximation which is amenable to solution via more widely available mixed-integer linear programming software is also presented.

It provides efficiency, reliability, maintainability. The challenge of interpreting the results of performance analysis and generate alternative design to build component system is quite critical in the software performance domain. Although, many approaches have been proposed and were successfully applied to predict software performance, still span of design space hinder the selection of the appropriate design alternative. Meta-heuristics such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) methods have proven its usefulness to solve the problem even with multi-degree of freedom. But, in recent investigations Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), an alternative search technique, often outperformed GA when applied to various problems. In this paper we describe performance prediction approach based on PSO for component-Based system development. The proposed approach aids developers to effectively trades-off between architectural designs alternatives. Boundary search technique and PSO are used to provoke more efficient results. To the best of our knowledge we are the first who employ PSO in software performance prediction. Outlines of our approach are presented and a case study applied using GA is described to be used by our approach for validation. This paper has concluded that, PSO technique can be used to effectively generate alternatives in spanned design space and facilitate the design decision during the development process.","doi":"10.1109/MySEC.2011.6140670","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Malaysian Conference in Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6129720/6140630/06140670.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Malaysian Conference in Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MySEC.2011.6140670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying particle swarm optimization to software performance prediction an introduction to the approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Computer architecture","Software performance","Optimization","Search problems","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","software performance prediction","component based system","CBS","genetic algorithms","GA","PSO","architectural designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["performance","prediction","model-based","heuristics approach","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Applying particle swarm optimization to software performance prediction an introduction to the approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140670/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"13-14 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12496359","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying particle swarm optimization to software performance prediction an introduction to the approach","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"MySECT3188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088399S","chronDate":"13-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6129720","isNumber":"6140630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6129720","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6140630","articleId":"6140670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6140679,"authors":[{"name":"Hamdi A.

The supervised learning technique using the LVQ method with training the neural network based on a competitive learning rule, that uses class information to move the voronoi vectors slightly, so as to improve the learning time process and the quality of the classifier decision regions. Furthermore, the window size of the feature map topology was selected based on the spatial distance between the winning neuron and its neighbors automatically.

The relays use a simple Amplify-and-Forward relaying mechanism. For such networks, we formulate the max-min and sum capacity optimization problems. The formulated optimization problems are non-convex and nonlinear in nature. We obtain the optimal solution of the optimization problems by using a known technique called Global Optimization Algorithm (GOP). We note that the computational complexity of the GOP algorithm grows exponentially with the number of relays. Therefore, we propose low-complexity heuristics that provide suboptimal solutions to the given optimization problems. The simulation results show that the performance of the heuristics is close to that of the respective optimal solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140819","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140819.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140819","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Optimization Algorithm and sub-optimal algorithms for power allocation in two-way relay assisted cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Global Optimization Algorithm and sub-optimal algorithms for power allocation in two-way relay assisted cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140819/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140819/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12495845","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Optimization Algorithm and sub-optimal algorithms for power allocation in two-way relay assisted cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061959S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140827,"authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Denno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Denno","id":"37279596500"},{"name":"Jun Imamura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Imamura","id":"37396374300"},{"name":"Masahiro Morikura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Morikura","id":"37282342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1180-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1179-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1178-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6140827","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Correlation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","receiving antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual layered signal processing receiver","16-QAM","transmit signal rotation","high speed signal transmission","wireless communication system","virtual channel","layered streams","received antenna","transmission speed","maximum likelihood estimation","channel matrix","signal constellation","BER performance","MIMO system"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel receiver, named as \u201ca virtual layered signal processing receiver for 16 QAM\u201d for high speed signal transmission in wireless communication systems. In the proposed receiver, the ordered successive detection is applied with the concept of virtual channel, which enables to detect layered streams even when the number of the layered streams is more than that of the received antennas. Therefore, the proposed receiver can increase the transmission speed of the down link in which a receiver is implemented in small terminals with a small number of antennas. The proposed receiver unfortunately degrades compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLD), however, when the channel matrix of the virtual channel is not full rank. To avoid the performance degradation, this paper proposes a technique that transmit signal constellation is phase-rotated with information fed back from the receiver. Actually, it is confirmed by computer simulation that only 1-bit of feed back information is enough to achieve the upper bound in BER performance in a 2 \u00d7 1 MIMO system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A virtual layered signal processing receiver for 16-QAM with transmit signal rotation","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140827","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140827.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A virtual layered signal processing receiver for 16-QAM with transmit signal rotation","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140827/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12506960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A virtual layered signal processing receiver for 16-QAM with transmit signal rotation","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053376S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140836,"authors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Malon","affiliation":["Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Malon","id":"37859172800"},{"name":"Jerzy Lopatka","affiliation":["Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Lopatka","id":"37371893400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1180-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1179-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1178-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6140836","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Time domain analysis","Frequency modulation","Generators","Frequency domain analysis","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","cognitive radio","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","spectrum pooling cognitive radio","OFDM signal","cognitive radio network","spectral resource","primary users identification","radio resources","temporary unused channels","primary user traffic","secondary users spectrum access","adaptive modulation scheme","OFDM modulation","band interference reduction"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio networks are promising systems to enable efficient use of spectral resources, thanks to identification of Primary Users (PU) possessing guaranteed radio resources and Secondary Users (SU), trying to use temporary unused channels.

A model of the WCDMA access control algorithm was developed and used to investigate network performance under jamming and various loading conditions. Jamming effectiveness was found to become less predictable as the load was increased. Increased loading levels were also found to generally increase the range to target at which jamming occurs. The viability of utilizing high-speed, constant bit rate, circuit-switched data calls as surrogates for multiple low-rate voice calls in a test environment was investigated.

To meet the growing demand for mobile data, we need to improve radio resources reuse capability. Partitioning of radio resources is a common practice in cellular network as it provides a simple and reliable way to distribute the resources over systems nodes. The reuse factor of one is hard to achieve in legacy cellular systems; with relaying and with adopting OFDMA and Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) technologies, we will try to achieve this goal by partitioning the radio resource over the relays within a single cell and efficiently reuse them. Some reuse schemes are proposed and studied along with other schemes presented in the literature. The tradeoff between outage performance and throughput enhancement is studied and the impact of power control, the number of hops and reuse capability is considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011

sensor network due to its flexibility and cost-effectiveness in deployment. Particularly, IEEE 802.16-2004 based on time division multiple access (TDMA) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) air interface supports mesh mode operation for last-mile connection to backhaul networks by means of distributed control functionalities. For the distributed operation, network and scheduling information is conveyed via control channels under a channel access protocol, named mesh election (ME). Meanwhile, in order to provide high data rate multimedia services, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) has been widely accepted by many proponents in the standardization parties such as 3GPP and IEEE 802.16. In these respects, we propose efficient two-dimensional ME protocols for OFDMA-based WMNs. The proposed protocols simply work by separating its procedure into two steps, subframe-and subchannel-level elections, which satisfy collision-free criteria for broadcast transmission and reception. Also, we suggest summation and product metrics for subchannel-level election, which have better performance in terms of transmission interval and resource utilization than that of independence metric by increasing the probability that a node succeeds in subframe- and subchannel-level elections subsequently.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140852","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140852.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient 2-D mesh election algorithms for OFDMA-based wireless mesh networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient 2-D mesh election algorithms for OFDMA-based wireless mesh networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140852/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12495870","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6140852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient 2-D mesh election algorithms for OFDMA-based wireless mesh networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052363S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6140858,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

We focus on the problem of assigning the relays, the relay powers and allocating the subcarriers to the destination nodes using the sum capacity of the cognitive radio system as the objective function to be maximized under the constraint of maximum acceptable levels of interference for the primary users (PU). The computational complexity of this assignment using exhaustive search algorithm grows exponentially with the number of relays, subcarriers and receivers. Thus we propose Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for this assignment problem. EDA is a probabilistic evolutionary algorithm which updates its population at each iteration on the basis of the probability densities obtained from the population of superior candidates evaluated and chosen at the previous iteration. EDA employed with our allocation scheme has low computational complexity and its performance is comparable to the Upper Bound of the solution as shown by various simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140858","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EDA-based joint power, subcarrier allocation and relay assignment scheme for multiuser relaying in OFDMA-based cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EDA-based joint power, subcarrier allocation and relay assignment scheme for multiuser relaying in OFDMA-based cognitive radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140858/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12495876","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6140858/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EDA-based joint power, subcarrier allocation and relay assignment scheme for multiuser relaying in OFDMA-based cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111261S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140866,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Mostafa","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Mostafa","id":"37085335186"},{"name":"Werner G.

Therefore they are used to solve classification and optimization problems in many scientific disciplines. This can be done because they are stable in the sense of Lyapunov. A RNN can be globally or locally stable depending on the fulfilled inherent stability conditions. When using a RNN in an optimization task, the global stability is in general preferred to avoid spurious responses or local minima. In this paper, we present some stability results (global and local) of the RNN (continuous-time and discrete-time) and we discuss the global and local stability issues on the basis of a RNN vector equalizer. We analyze also the impact of the stability conditions on the performance of the RNN vector equalizer.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140866","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140866.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global vs. local stability of recurrent neural networks as vector equalizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140866/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Global vs. local stability of recurrent neural networks as vector equalizer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140866/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12495881","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global vs. local stability of recurrent neural networks as vector equalizer","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098077S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6140871,"authors":[{"name":"Xiong Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Yin","id":"37899439400"},{"name":"Zhaoxia Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoxia","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37899617900"},{"name":"Yi Dan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Dan","id":"37903052700"},{"name":"Zhenglin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhenglin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37065922500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1180-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1179-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1178-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6140871","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Floors","Filling","Cost function","Encoding","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-rate long-length structured QC-LDPC","error performance","data storage","code-design algorithm","structured quasicyclic low-density parity-check code","SQC-LDPC code","parity-check matrix","optimized degree distribution","density evolution","differential evolution","cost function","short block-cycle","cycle extrinsic message degree","simulation curve","Shannon limit","error floor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SQC-LDPC","high-rate","long-length","error floor","ACE"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve error performance of data storage, this paper presents a code-design algorithm for a class of structured quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (SQC-LDPC) codes with high rate ( R >;= 0.9 ) and long-length (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n <; 60 n).

A tracking algorithm was proposed to track small targets in grayscale videos whose size was from 7\u00d77 pixels to 25\u00d725 pixels. The algorithm included six steps: (1) enlarge the target and the surrounding region by bilinear interpolation; (2) enhance the target features of the enlarged region by histogram equalization; (3) expand the single grayscale video into three channel video by pixel gradient; (4) establish the target model and the target candidates by kernel density estimation in the enlarged and equalized image space; (5) obtain the target location in the enlarged image by mean shift method; and (6) transform the location of target from the enlarged image to the original image. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(n). The experimental results showed that the algorithm was able to track the small targets steadily, accurately and quickly. The deviation of target location was zero for most frames and no more than 2 pixels for a few frames in which the target rotated at a large angle. The time spent in tracking the small target in a frame was 15 or 16 ms for the two testing cases in this study.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140873.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bilinear interpolation mean shift small target tracking algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Target tracking","Histograms","Interpolation","Videos","Algorithm design and analysis","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","object tracking","target tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilinear interpolation","mean shift small target tracking algorithm","grayscale video","histogram equalization","pixel gradient","kernel density estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["small target tracking","interpolation","histogram equalization","mean shift","kernel density estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A bilinear interpolation mean shift small target tracking algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12495888","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bilinear interpolation mean shift small target tracking algorithm","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063545S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6140876,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadali Mohammadi","affiliation":["K.

Nakagami-m fading channels. Our analysis considers a semi-blind relay equipped with a single antenna, and a multiple-antenna source and destination. We first derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Utilizing this CDF, closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the symbol error rate (SER) of the considered relay networks are derived. Furthermore, a closed-form approximation expression for the ergodic capacity is presented along with a respective asymptotic formula. Numerical results are given to verify our analysis through representative examples. In particular, the approximation curves are in very close agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations. In the high SNR regime, the asymptotic curves tightly converge to the approximation and simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140880.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO AF semi-blind relay networks with OSTBC transmission over Nakagami-m fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Approximation methods","Closed-form solutions","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antennas","approximation theory","error statistics","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels","orthogonal codes","probability","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO AF semiblind relay network","OSTBC transmission","Nakagami-m fading channel","dual-hop multiple-input multiple-output network","amplify-and-forward network","orthogonal space-time block coding","single antenna","multiple-antenna source","cumulative distribution function","CDF","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","outage probability","symbol error rate","SER","closed-form approximation","ergodic capacity","Monte Carlo simulation","asymptotic curve"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"MIMO AF semi-blind relay networks with OSTBC transmission over Nakagami-m fading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140880/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12495893","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO AF semi-blind relay networks with OSTBC transmission over Nakagami-m fading","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062729S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6140882,"authors":[{"name":"George D.

Our simulations indicate that the proposed algorithms come within 3 dB of the spectral efficiency of the optimal Water-Filling AMC method and 2 dB of the BL-AMC model, but with significantly reduced computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Adaptive Modulation and Coding techniques for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140882","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140882.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Adaptive Modulation and Coding techniques for OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140882/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12495895","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Adaptive Modulation and Coding techniques for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047314S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140891,"authors":[{"name":"Torbj\u00f6rn Wigren","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden","WCDMA RAN System Management, Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Torbj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Wigren","id":"37284683400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1180-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1179-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1178-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6140891","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Noise","Estimation","Interference","Floors","Complexity theory","Thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","communication complexity","Kalman filters","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity Kalman filtering","intercell interference","power based load estimation","WCDMA uplink","online estimation","intracell interference","enhanced uplink","wideband code division multiple access","WCDMA cellular system","Kalman filter estimator","dedicated physical control channels","complexity reduction","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block matrices","complexity reduction","enhanced uplink","estimation","inter-cell interference","intra-cell interference","load","Kalman filter","noise floor power estimation","WCDMA"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents an algorithm for on-line estimation of the intra- and inter-cell interference in the enhanced uplink (EUL) of the wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) cellular system.

A cluster of wireless sensors, also known as motes, can be distributed in a certain location creating an IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network island that can convey information among its nodes. In many cases, multiple 802.15.4 islands exist within the same environment, such that the islands are out of motes' radio range of communication. In such cases, it is desirable to integrate the islands in order to exchange sensor information between them. In addition, in case of remote access of data, interconnecting the islands allows users to access information remotely from any island through a single Internet gateway. This article proposes a system for integrating 802.15.4 wireless sensor network islands. For certain applications, e.g., a battlefield, security is of high importance. Thus, in addition to providing reliable high speed communication links between the islands, these links should be secure and invulnerable to eavesdropping. Free Space Optical (FSO) links can be used to achieve these goals by providing secure, reliable, high-bandwidth communication among the 802.15.4 islands. An integration system consisting of two islands is implemented and tested. Information from one of the motes in the first island is sent to the second island through an FSO link. The integration system in this article presents a novel approach accompanied by an actual implementation. It is the author's hope that the suggested framework can be profitably employed in a wide range of WSN applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnection of IEEE 802.15.4 islands through free space optical communication links","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140892","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140892.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Interconnection of IEEE 802.15.4 islands through free space optical communication links","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140892/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12506967","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnection of IEEE 802.15.4 islands through free space optical communication links","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103289S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140896,"authors":[{"name":"Yasuhiro Takano","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Takano","id":"38241353700"},{"name":"Khoirul Anwar","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Khoirul","lastName":"Anwar","id":"37396266500"},{"name":"Tad Matsumoto","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan","Centre of Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tad","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37277382600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1180-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1179-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1178-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6140896","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neodymium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","channel estimation","decoding","equalisers","mobility management (mobile radio)","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo equalization","doped accumulator","channel estimation","broadband single carrier signalling","TEQ-ACC","decoder","soft replica generation method","frame-error-rate","pedestrian mobility channel assumption","adaptive subspace tracking technique","low rank adaptive filtering","sliding window singular value decomposition-based technique"]}],"abstract":"The major objective of this paper is to reveal the performance of the turbo equalization using doped accumulator (TEQ-ACC) when it is combined with channel estimation, in broadband single carrier signalling.

Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantage of the proposed training design for the linear minimum mean-squared-error (LMMSE) channel vector estimation over the training design for the LMMSE channel matrix estimation.","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6133550/6140814/06140900.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2011.6140900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for amplify-and-forward relaying with spatially correlated antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for amplify-and-forward relaying with spatially correlated antennas","htmlLink":"/document/6140900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12506969","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for amplify-and-forward relaying with spatially correlated antennas","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077059S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6133550","isNumber":"6140814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6133550","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6140814","articleId":"6140900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6140904,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngmin","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37577459600"},{"name":"Hyundong Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyundong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37287623300"},{"name":"Tony Q.

In the presence of perfect channel state information (CSI), we formulate the optimization algorithms in a semi-decentralized manner by introducing the signal-to-leakage plus noise ratio criteria. Taking into account imperfect CSI, we also propose robust algorithms tailored by the worst-case design to mitigate the effect of channel uncertainty.

The ultra-wide PLL-stabilization was achieved using a reverse frequency position mixer in the PLL (offset-PLL) resulting in a compensation of the variation of the oscillators tuning sensitivity with the variation of the N-divider in the PLL. The output power of the transceiver chip, as well as of the mm-wave module (containing a waveguide transition), is sufficiently flat versus the output frequency (variation <;3 dB).

Only a tiny fraction of the produced collisions can be stored offline and immense real-time data reduction is needed. An effective trigger system must maintain high trigger efficiencies for the physics we are most interested in while suppressing the enormous QCD backgrounds. This requires massive computing power to minimize the online execution time of complex algorithms. A multi-level trigger is an effective solution to meet this challenge. The Fast Tracker (FTK) is an upgrade to the current ATLAS trigger system that will operate at full Level-1 output rates and provide high-quality tracks reconstructed over the entire inner detector by the start of processing in the Level-2 Trigger. FTK solves the combinatorial challenge inherent to tracking by exploiting the massive parallelism of associative memories that can compare inner detector hits to millions of pre-calculated patterns simultaneously. The tracking problem within matched patterns is further simplified by using pre-computed linearized fitting constants and relying on fast DSPs in modern commercial FPGAs. Overall, FTK is able to compute the helix parameters for all tracks in an event and apply quality cuts in less than 100 \u03bcs.

In the proposed DR strategy, consumers will have their own choices to determine which load to control and when.

However, write-through policy also incurs large energy overhead due to the increased accesses to caches at the lower level (e.g., L2 caches) during write operations. In this paper, we propose a new cache architecture referred to as way-tagged cache to improve the energy efficiency of write-through caches. By maintaining the way tags of L2 cache in the L1 cache during read operations, the proposed technique enables L2 cache to work in an equivalent direct-mapping manner during write hits, which account for the majority of L2 cache accesses. This leads to significant energy reduction without performance degradation. Simulation results on the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves 65.4% energy savings in L2 caches on average with only 0.02% area overhead and no performance degradation. Similar results are also obtained under different L1 and L2 cache configurations. Furthermore, the idea of way tagging can be applied to existing low-power cache design techniques to further improve energy efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140944/","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6140944/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13188370","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient L2 Cache Architecture Using Way Tag Information Under Write-Through Policy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient L2 Cache Architecture Using Way Tag Information Under Write-Through Policy","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-dai-2181879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063657S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6387661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6387661","articleId":"6140944","onlineDate":"26 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6140950,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Liu","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37677856300"},{"name":"Yuhong Kang","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuhong","lastName":"Kang","id":"38238328400"},{"name":"Mohini Verma","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohini","lastName":"Verma","id":"38235352800"},{"name":"Marius K.

Data from measured devices are used to model the statistical variation of an MTJ's critical switching current and resistance. The sensitivity of the design space to different design parameters is also analyzed for the scaling of both the MTJ and the underlying transistor technology. A design flow, using a sensitivity-based analysis and an MTJ switching model based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, is proposed to optimize design margins for gigabit-scale memories. Design points for improved yield, density, and memory performance are extracted from MTJ-compatible complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies for 90-, 65-, 45-, and 32-nm processes.

The key is to operate the R-FSPM motor in the remedial mode by injecting harmonic currents, the so-called remedial injected-harmonic-current (RIHC) operation mode. Moreover, the motor losses at the existing and the proposed remedial operations are compared for evaluation.

Signal sparse representation with an overcomplete basis can accurately distinguish correlated or even coherent broadband signals coming from different positions in a single realization of data. Therefore, beamspace weighting beamforming based on sparse representation can enhance the on-axis signals while suppressing the interference from the off-axis ones thoroughly and improve the resolution and SNR of PW emission ultrasonic imaging system. Several simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithm in terms of parameter selection, resolution and contrast enhancement, robustness to additive noise, and selection of the lateral range of dictionary are performed. The results show that the proposed method is robust to additive noise, and both higher resolution and contrast are attainable with SRBF in PW emission by comparing with conventional delay and sum, minimum variance beamformer, and phase coherence factor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sparse Representation Beamformer for High-Frame-Rate Ultrasound Imaging Instrument","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2181778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6178360/06140968.pdf","startPage":"1323","endPage":"1333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2181778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sparse Representation Beamformer for High-Frame-Rate Ultrasound Imaging Instrument","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6140968/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12639189","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sparse Representation Beamformer for High-Frame-Rate Ultrasound Imaging Instrument","sourcePdf":"tim-zhang-2181778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087574S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6178360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6178360","articleId":"6140968","onlineDate":"26 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6140974,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6410053/6140974/6140974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Zhang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Nanchang University, Nanchang, China, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in electric measurement technology and instrument from Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2009.

The scheme is then formulated as a quadratic program (QP), which is subject to an equality constraint and a bound constraint, and such a QP problem is solved by a discrete QP solver, i.e., a numerical algorithm.

The message is assumed to be broken down into packets, and the transmission is conducted over multiple frames. Each frame is divided into time slots, and each link in the routing tree is assigned one time slot in which to transmit its current packet. We present an algorithm for determining the number of time slots and the scheduling of the links in these time slots to optimize the connectivity of the network, which we define to be the probability that all links can achieve the required throughput. In addition to time multiplexing, the MIMO nodes also employ beamforming to manage interference when links are simultaneously active, and the beamformers are designed with the maximum connectivity metric in mind. The effects of outdated channel-state information are taken into account in both the scheduling and the beamforming designs. We also derive bounds on the network connectivity and sum transmit power to illustrate the impact of interference on network performance. Our simulation results demonstrate that the choice of the number of time slots is critical in optimizing network performance and illustrates the significant advantage provided by multiple antennas in improving network connectivity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2185858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6197275/06140985.pdf","startPage":"1762","endPage":"1778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2185858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6197275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-Aware Scheduling for Connectivity in MIMO Ad Hoc Multicast Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6140985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6140985/","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Aware Scheduling for Connectivity in MIMO Ad Hoc Multicast Networks","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12711960","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6140985/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-Aware Scheduling for Connectivity in MIMO Ad Hoc Multicast Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-jiang-2185858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148526S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6197275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6197275","articleId":"6140985","onlineDate":"26 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6141022,"authors":[{"name":"Saber M.

The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than well-known state-of-the-art algorithms with a faster convergence behavior.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2011.6141022","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2011.6141022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140986","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6111769/6140986/06141022.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved genetic algorithm for constrained optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141022/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved genetic algorithm for constrained optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141022/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12507832","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved genetic algorithm for constrained optimization","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"043Paper59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097218S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6111769","isNumber":"6140986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6111769","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6140986","articleId":"6141022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6141025,"authors":[{"name":"Hala M.

Several factors affect the recognition performance; experimental results are applied to the ORL database which contains variability in expression, pose, and facial details. The experimental result showed that the Eigenfaces/RBF system has recognition error rates that are lower than those of the Eigenfaces/MLP system by 3%.

Daily compensation of the deficiency requires 4-6 insulin injections to be taken every day. The aim of this insulin therapy is to maintain normoglycemia - i.e., a blood glucose level between 4-7 [mmol/L]. To determine the quantity and timing of these injections, several different approaches are used. Prediction of future glucose values can be used for early hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic alarms for adjustment of insulin injections or insulin infusion rates of manual or automated pumps. Recent developments in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices open new opportunities for glycemia management of diabetic patients. CGM technologies provide glucose readings at high frequency and consequently detailed insight into the subject's glucose variations. The objective of this research is to use glucose readings that are obtained from CGM devices, to develop a feed forward neural network model (NNM) to predict future glucose values. This NNM can be used in model predictive control systems to automatically adjust the glucose level in type-1 diabetic patients. The results of our research indicate that the NNM can be used to accurately predict future glucose values for prediction horizons of 30 minutes or less without time delay between the predicted output and the real glucose samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141026/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12507835","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141026/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of subcutaneous glucose concentration for type-1 diabetic patients using a feed forward neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of subcutaneous glucose concentration for type-1 diabetic patients using a feed forward neural network","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"052Paper85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079444S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6111769","isNumber":"6140986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6111769","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6140986","articleId":"6141026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6141033,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Hassan Mansour","affiliation":["Manufacturing Engineering Dept., Arab Organization for Industrialization, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Hassan Mansour","id":"37885600700"},{"name":"Salwa H.

In this paper, the wavelets of the Daubechies family are exploited for extracting the relevant movement information in moving image sequences using 3D wavelet. The proposed algorithm is applied for traffic monitoring systems. The objective and subjective experimental results obtained by applying the wavelet types are compared and interpreted in terms of the wavelet properties and the characteristics of the image sequences. The comparisons show the superior performance of the low order Daubechies wavelets in the presence of noisy images and changing lighting conditions when compared to the application of high order Daubechies wavelets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2011.6141044","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6111769/6140986/06141044.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2011.6141044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the selection of the proper wavelet for moving object detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the selection of the proper wavelet for moving object detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507847","htmlLink":"/document/6141044/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the selection of the proper wavelet for moving object detection","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"081Paper51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067106S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6111769","isNumber":"6140986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6111769","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6140986","articleId":"6141044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6141047,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed A.-Megeed Salem","affiliation":["Department of Scientific Computing, Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences, Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohammed A.-Megeed","lastName":"Salem","id":"38181601700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0128-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0127-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0126-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6141047","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Wavelet analysis","Three dimensional displays","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","image motion analysis","image representation","image resolution","image segmentation","object detection","pedestrians","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing","video surveillance","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving object detection","temporal resolution mosaic","spatial resolution mosaic","computational complexity","video surveillance applications","multiresolution analysis","wavelet transform","visual details degree","image representation","3D wavelet packet","image sequence analysis","vehicles traffic","pedestrian zones"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Segmentation","3D Wavelet Packet","Multiresolution Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141047","abstract":"Algorithms that offer a simultaneous accurate detection of moving objects and low computational complexity are yet a challenge for video surveillance applications.

However, most of these solutions calculate only the alignment similarity score without finding the actual alignment. This paper presents an efficient solution to find the optimal alignment of the huge DNA sequences. This solution releases the condition of the sequence size to be in megabyte-scale instead of few kilobytes. The fundamental innovation in this work is developing an efficient, linear space complexity, parallel solution to achieve the optimum alignment with relatively good performance. The shared memory parallel architecture is the focus of this work therefore; we have considered off-the-shelf systems like multi-core CPUs as well as advanced shared memory platforms. Experimental results show that the proposed solution achieved high records compared to other solutions that targeted the same goal with less hardware requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2011.6141059","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6111769/6140986/06141059.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2011.6141059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140986","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","startPage":"295","endPage":"300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An efficient solution for aligning huge DNA sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141059/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12507860","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient solution for aligning huge DNA sequences","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"103Paper50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070539S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6111769","isNumber":"6140986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6111769","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6140986","articleId":"6141059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6141148,"authors":[{"name":"Remo Ribichini","affiliation":["UK Research Centre in NDE, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6141134/6141148/6141148-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Remo Ribichini Was born in Ancona, Italy, in 1982.

The fundamental shear horizontal (SH) wave mode in plates and the torsional mode in pipe-like structures are especially useful because of their non-dispersive character. Guided waves can be generated by either piezoelectric transducers or electro- magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), and EMATs can be based on either the Lorentz force or magnetostriction. Several EMAT configurations can be used to produce SH waves, the most common being Lorentz-force periodic permanent magnet and magnetostrictive EMATs, the latter being directly applied on the sample or with a bonded strip of highly magnetostrictive material on the plate. This paper compares the performance of these solutions on steel structures. To quantitatively assess the wave amplitude produced by different probes, a finite element model of the elementary transducers has been developed. The results of the model are experimentally validated and the simulations are further used to study the dependence of ultrasonic wave amplitude on key design parameters. The analysis shows that magnetostrictive EMATs directly applied on mild steel plates have comparatively poor performance that is dependent on the precise magneto-mechanical properties of the test object. Periodic permanent magnet EMATs generate intermediate wave amplitudes and are noncontact and insensitive to the variations in properties seen across typical steels. Large signal amplitudes can be achieved with magnetostrictive EMATs with a layer of highly magnetostrictive material attached between the transducer and the plate, but this compromises the noncontact nature of the transducer.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2120","startPage":"2571","endPage":"2581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6141134/06141148.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study and comparison of different EMAT configurations for SH wave inspection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"Study and comparison of different EMAT configurations for SH wave inspection","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","volume":"58","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141148/","accessionNumber":"12524235","pubMedId":"23443693","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141148/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study and comparison of different EMAT configurations for SH wave inspection","sourcePdf":"t11c2571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064064S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6141134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6141134","articleId":"6141148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6141155,"authors":[{"name":"Hojong Choi","affiliation":["National Institutes of Health (NIH) Resource Center for Medical Ultrasonic Transducer Technology and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6141134/6141155/6141155-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hojong Choi Received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Kyunghee Univeristy, Yongin, Korea, in 2000, and the M.S.

This approach is required to minimize the parasitic capacitances in the receive mode, especially in catheter-based volumetric imaging arrays, for which the elements must be small. Furthermore, optimization of the available silicon area and minimized number of connections occurs when the CMUTs are fabricated directly above the associated electronics. Here, we describe successful fabrication and performance evaluation of CMUT arrays for intravascular imaging on custom-designed CMOS receiver electronics from a commercial IC foundry. The CMUT-on-CMOS process starts with surface isolation and mechanical planarization of the CMOS electronics to reduce topography. The rest of the CMUT fabrication is achieved by modifying a low-temperature micromachining process through the addition of a single mask and developing a dry etching step to produce sloped sidewalls for simple and reliable CMUT-to-CMOS interconnection. This CMUT-to-CMOS interconnect method reduced the parasitic capacitance by a factor of 200 when compared with a standard wire-bonding method. Characterization experiments indicate that the CMUT-on-CMOS elements are uniform in frequency response and are similar to CMUTs simultaneously fabricated on standard silicon wafers without electronics integration. Ex- periments on a 1.6-mm-diameter dual-ring CMUT array with a center frequency of 15 MHz show that both the CMUTs and the integrated CMOS electronics are fully functional. The SNR measurements indicate that the performance is adequate for imaging chronic total occlusions located 1 cm from the CMUT array.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6141134/06141156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141134","startPage":"2659","endPage":"2667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic CMUT-on-CMOS Integration for Intravascular Ultrasound Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic CMUT-on-CMOS Integration for Intravascular Ultrasound Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12524243","pubMedId":"23443701","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6141156/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic CMUT-on-CMOS Integration for Intravascular Ultrasound Applications","sourcePdf":"t11c2659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152656S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6141134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6141134","articleId":"6141156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6141159,"authors":[{"name":"Hoe Woong Kim","affiliation":["BK21 School for Creative Engineering Design of Next Generation Mechanical and Aerospace Systems, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6141134/6141159/6141159-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hoe Woong Kim was born in Namwon, Korea. in 1977.

Motivated by recent developments in magnetostrictive transducer technology, which is especially efficient in torsional and shear wave generation, the goal of this investigation is to extend this technology for simultaneous identification of the axial and circumferential locations of cracks by using shear horizontal (SH) waves. Unlike the conventional magnetostrictive patch method using a single complete patch wound around the pipe's circumference, the proposed method segments the patch into several pieces to generate SH waves propagating over the pipe surface. Accordingly, SH waves in a pipe are generated and sensed individually by a meander coil placed separately on each segment. By using two sets of segmented-patch arrays separated by some distance, the cylindrical surface of a pipe can be inspected both axially and circumferentially. After the underlying angular profile of the patch segment is investigated, experiments identifying the axial and circumferential locations of multiple cracks in a pipe are carried out to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6141134/06141159.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141134","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shear-horizontal wave-based pipe damage inspection by arrays of segmented magnetostrictive patches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shear-horizontal wave-based pipe damage inspection by arrays of segmented magnetostrictive patches","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12524246","pubMedId":"23443704","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6141159/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shear-horizontal wave-based pipe damage inspection by arrays of segmented magnetostrictive patches","sourcePdf":"t11c2689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068573S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6141134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6141134","articleId":"6141159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6141160,"authors":[{"name":"Haiying Huang","affiliation":["Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering Department, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6141134/6141160/6141160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haiying Huang (M'98) received the B.S. degree in aircraft propulsion from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA) in 1987.

Cloud has given a new meaning to distributed, and off-premises computing. Although, Cloud offers great benefits, it also introduces a myriad of security threats to the information and data which is now being ported from on-premises to off-premises. Where cloud computing can help organizations accomplish more by paying less (in the longer run) and breaking the physical boundaries between IT infrastructure and its users, due to openness of accessible information and data relying on trust between cloud provider and customer, heightened security threats must be overcome in order to benefit fully from this new computing exemplar. Breach in the security of any component in the cloud can be both disaster for the organization (the customer) and defacing for the provider. This paper explores the security issues related to the cloud. The paper also discusses the existing security approaches to secure the cloud infrastructure and applications and their drawbacks. Finally, we explore some key research challenges of implementing new cloud-aware security solutions that can provide the likes of pre-emptive protection for complex and ever dynamic Cloud infrastructure, followed by conclusion where we try to entail the whole research and try to formulate a security strategy which will enable the Cloud providers and customers alike to fight against ever emerging security threats.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emerging security challenges in cloud computing: An insight to cloud security challenges and their mitigation","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141247","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141247.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Emerging security challenges in cloud computing: An insight to cloud security challenges and their mitigation","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141247/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12507974","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emerging security challenges in cloud computing: An insight to cloud security challenges and their mitigation","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp041P161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049599S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6141249,"authors":[{"name":"Kawaljeet Kaur Kapoor","affiliation":["School of Business and Economics, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"],"firstName":"Kawaljeet Kaur","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"38234555200"},{"name":"Michael D.

The performance of PSO depends on its parameters to a great extent. Among all other parameters of PSO, Inertia weight is crucial one that affects the performance of PSO significantly and therefore needs a special attention to be chosen appropriately. This paper proposes an adaptive exponentially decreasing inertia weight that depends on particle's performance iteration-wise and is different for each particle. The corresponding variant is termed as Fine Grained Inertia Weight PSO (FGIWPSO). The new inertia weight is proposed to improve the diversity of the swarm in order to avoid the stagnation phenomenon and a speeding convergence to global optima. The effectiveness of proposed approach is demonstrated by testing it on a suit of ten benchmark functions. The proposed FGIWPSO is compared with two existing PSO variants having nonlinear and exponential inertia weight strategies respectively. Experimental results assert that the proposed modification helps in improving PSO performance in terms of solution quality and convergence rate as well.","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141283","startPage":"424","endPage":"429","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141283.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new fine grained inertia weight Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Benchmark testing","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine grained inertia weight particle swarm optimization","bird flock behaviour","fish schools","global optimizer","particle performance iteration-wise","swarm diversity","stagnation phenomenon","speeding convergence","nonlinear inertia weight strategies","exponential inertia weight strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","parameters","nonlinear adaptive inertia weight","stagnation","convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A new fine grained inertia weight Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141283/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12508010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new fine grained inertia weight Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp077P243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137777S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6141287,"authors":[{"name":"Sudhir B.

The existing designs usually have two important assumptions that the users are delay insensitive and Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSI) is perfect. In practice, users have heterogeneous delay requirements and CSI usually becomes outdated in time varying channel, which in turn leads to systematic packet errors and hence results in significant degradation on the throughput. CSI at the physical layer and scheduling using queuing theory at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, in order to maximize the throughput and spectral efficiency under the heterogeneous delay constraints. In this paper we study the effect of the imperfect channel state information (CSI) on the performance of adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. To perform resource allocation, CSI must be fed back to the transmitter. Such feedback CSI is always imperfect due to the time varying channel.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141287.pdf","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient resource allocation scheme with partial Channel State Information","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141287","startPage":"450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An efficient resource allocation scheme with partial Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141287/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12508014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6141287/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient resource allocation scheme with partial Channel State Information","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp081P252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079328S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6141294,"authors":[{"name":"Manal Osman Suliman","affiliation":["SE Department EC., Osmania University, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Manal Osman","lastName":"Suliman","id":"38235292700"},{"name":"Vellanki S.S.

There are tradeoff between time and cost to complete the activities of a project; in general, the less expensive the resources used, the longer it takes to complete an activity. This problem represents a challenging task because the activity duration and cost have uncertainty associated with them, which should be considered when performing schedule optimization. This paper proposes a hybrid technique that combines simulated annealing algorithms (SA) with fuzzy logic to solve construction project time-cost trade-off problem under uncertainty. Fuzzy set theory is applied to model the managers' behavior in predicting time and cost pertinent to a specific option within an activity. SA is used as a searching mechanism to establish the optimal time-cost profiles under different risk levels. A simple case study is used for testing the proposed approach. In comparison with the previous models, the new model provides managers with greater flexibility to analyze their decisions in a more realistic manner. The results also indicate that SA is able to generate solutions with high quality make it suitable for solving trade off optimization problems in the construction management field.","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141294","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141294.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"494","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of uncertain construction time-cost trade off problem using simulated annealing algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of uncertain construction time-cost trade off problem using simulated annealing algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12508021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6141294/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of uncertain construction time-cost trade off problem using simulated annealing algorithm","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp088P266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063254S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6141296,"authors":[{"name":"Vinnakota Bapi Raju","firstName":"Vinnakota Bapi","lastName":"Raju","id":"38232138600"},{"name":"T.

Advantages of multi application smart cards include ease in carrying a single card instead of multiple cards, ease of use among other advantages. With its limited memory size, storage of data efficiently plays an important role. A major challenge faced in multi application smart card is the storage of various images including fingerprint, personal identity photo and medical images. Lossless image compression techniques may not fully satisfy the space constraints faced in multi application smart cards, whereas lossy medical image compression cannot be applied satisfactorily across all the images stored in the card. Segmentation techniques to identify Non Region of Interest (NROI) and Region of Interest (ROI) can improve the compression rate by lossy compression for the NROI area and lossless compression for ROI area. In this paper it is proposed to implement an extension of the active contour segmentation model using the proposed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the segmentation. The ROI obtained through the proposed segmentation is compressed using lossless compression and the NROI is compressed using lossy compression.","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141302","startPage":"535","endPage":"539","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141302.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective image segmentation using Particle Swarm Optimization for image compression in multi application smart cards","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Smart cards","Image segmentation","Active contours","Particle swarm optimization","Wavelet transforms","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image segmentation","particle swarm optimisation","smart cards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","particle swarm optimization","lossless image compression techniques","multi application smart cards","driving license","health insurance card","national identity card","access card","limited memory size","data storage","personal identity photo","medical images","nonregion of interest","region of interest","lossy compression","NROI area","ROI area","active contour segmentation model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart cards","Image Segmentation","Image Compression","Active contour model","Particle Swarm Optimization","Wavelets","Symlet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effective image segmentation using Particle Swarm Optimization for image compression in multi application smart cards","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141302/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12508029","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective image segmentation using Particle Swarm Optimization for image compression in multi application smart cards","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp096P280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036603S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6141313,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

To satisfy the requirement, one can leverage multi-core architectures to parallelize traffic monitoring so as to progress information processing capabilities over traditional uni-processor architectures. In this paper an effective scheduling framework for multi-core processors that strike a balance between control over the system and an effective network traffic control mechanism for high-performance computing is proposed. In the proposed Cache Fair Thread Scheduling (CFTS), information supplied by the user to guide threads scheduling and also, where necessary, gives the programmer fine control over thread placement. Cloud computing has recently received considerable attention, as a promising approach for delivering network traffic services by improving the utilization of data centre resources. The primary goal of scheduling framework is to improve application throughput and overall system utilization in cloud applications. The resultant aim of the framework is to improve fairness so that each thread continues to make good forward progress. The experimental results show that the parallel CFTS could not only increase the processing rate, but also keep a well performance on stability which is important for cloud computing. This makes, it an effective network traffic control mechanism for cloud computing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Cache Fair Thread Scheduling for multi core processors using wait free data structures in cloud computing applications","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141313","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141313.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Cache Fair Thread Scheduling for multi core processors using wait free data structures in cloud computing applications","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141313/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12508040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Cache Fair Thread Scheduling for multi core processors using wait free data structures in cloud computing applications","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp107P303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055927S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6141322,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It exploits the inefficient utilization of radio frequency spectrum without causing destructive interference to the licensed/primary user communication. In recent past, most of the studies on spectrum sensing are focused on cooperative/multinode detection approaches. However, they are confined to the detection of signals in a single frequency band or narrow band. In order to improve the opportunistic throughput, the CR must sense the signals in multiple bands or wideband. This paper presents a wideband spectrum sensing technique based on energy measurement in each sub band.

FIR filter design is a multi-modal optimization problem. An iterative method is introduced to find the optimal solution of FIR filter design problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is similar to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in that it performs a structured randomized search of an unknown parameter space by manipulating a population of parameters to converge to a suitable solution. IPSO is an improved PSO that proposes a new definition for the velocity vector and swarm updating and hence the solution quality is improved. Evolutionary algorithms like real code genetic algorithm (RGA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) have been used here for the design of linear phase band stop FIR filter. In the design process, the filter length, pass band and stop band frequencies, feasible pass band and stop band ripple sizes are specified. A comparison of simulation results reveals the optimization efficacy of the algorithm over the prevailing optimization techniques for the solution of the multimodal, non-differentiable, highly non-linear, and constrained filter design problems.","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141331","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141331.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"704","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIR band stop filter optimization by improved particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"FIR band stop filter optimization by improved particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12508057","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6141331/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FIR band stop filter optimization by improved particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp125P348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100439S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6141348,"authors":[{"name":"Akash Punhani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, F.E.T.

The performance of the system may vary from user to user as simple routing can work for simple transferring but as the new era techniques of come into existence new parameters came into existence like the bandwidth requirement for VoIP is one of them. Not only the bandwidth is the single requirement but on time packet delivery less loss of packets may also be the criteria. These all add some constrains into deciding the route of a packet from source to the destination. As we have the multiple criteria for evolution the problem of deciding the path becomes an NP hard problem. The Genetic Algorithms have been efficiently used for solving such type of Problem in Past. So an effort is made to solve the QOS Routing Problem using Evolutionary algorithm using the different sorting techniques to improve the performance time of the most efficient algorithm that is NSGA II.

evaluation of decision tree versus artificial neural network based classifiers in diversity of datasets","abstract":"Large databases of digital information are ubiquitous. Data from the neighborhood store's checkout register, your bank's credit card authorization device, records in your doctor's office, patterns in your telephone calls and many more applications generate streams of digital records archived in huge databases, sometimes in so-called data warehouses A new generation of computational techniques and tools is required to support the extraction of useful knowledge from the rapidly growing volumes of data. These techniques and tools are the subject of the emerging field of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining. Data mining plays an important role to discover important information to help in decision making of a decision support system. It has been the active area of research in the last decade. The classification is one of the important tasks of data mining. Different kind of classifiers have been suggested and tested to predict the future events based on unseen data. This paper compares the performance evaluation of decision tree and artificial neural network based classifiers in diversity of datasets. Three decision trees (CHAID, QUEST and C5.0), and one ANN based back propagation classifier have been compared in terms of predictive accuracy, training time and comprehensibility. Out of the decision trees, QUEST generates trees with lesser levels and depth showing more comprehensibility. C5.0 and back propagation classifier show predictive accuracy of the same order. Back propagation based classifier shows zero comprehensibility. This research work shows that decision tree based classifiers are better for organizational decision support systems as compared to ANN based classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141349/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12508075","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141349/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of decision tree versus artificial neural network based classifiers in diversity of datasets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of decision tree versus artificial neural network based classifiers in diversity of datasets","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp143P396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056402S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6141351,"authors":[{"name":"Pardeep Kumar","affiliation":["Department of CSE & IT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Pardeep","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38583528800"},{"name":"Nitin","affiliation":["Department of CSE & IT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"lastName":"Nitin","id":"37302882300"},{"name":"Vivek Sehgal","affiliation":["Department of CSE & IT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Sehgal","id":"37683821300"},{"name":"Kinjal Shah","affiliation":["Department of CSE & IT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Kinjal","lastName":"Shah","id":"38238502700"},{"name":"Shiv Shankar Prasad Shukla","affiliation":["Department of CSE & IT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Shiv Shankar Prasad","lastName":"Shukla","id":"38236859600"},{"name":"Durg Singh Chauhan","affiliation":["Uttarakhand Technical University, Sudhowala, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Durg Singh","lastName":"Chauhan","id":"37581240700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0126-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0127-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0125-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6141351","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1091},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Fires","Cloud computing","Databases","Security","Data mining","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer network security","data mining","hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing security","hidden Markov model","IT industry","data management","data seeking","data providers","cloud providers","data mining","intrusion detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","firewall gateway","filter networks","cluster analysis","hidden markov model","data mining"]}],"abstract":"In today's fastest growing IT industry Cloud Computing is gaining much more popularity because the Cloud providers feel that it is very easy to manage the data in the cloud environment rather than normal web-sites in form of simple web pages.

Deploying VoIP in opportunistic communication models like cognitive radio requires thorough analysis of the factors involved in design and implementation. The objective of this paper is to implement VoIP successfully over a cognitive radio network and maintain the call quality at an acceptable limit. Initially, a model of VoIP is built over cognitive radio network using OPNET Modeler 16.0.A. The QoS parameters of delay, jitter and packet loss are analyzed over a basic cognitive radio cycle in the developed model.

An on board real time digital signal processing system is designed using FPGA, the architecture and the state-of-the art of the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) make them especially suitable to act as interface between an high speed ADC and a data processing unit. The platform can decode process of various kinds of digital and analog signals simultaneously For the optimum performance a 16 bit 1 MSPS ADC is interfaced with FPGA to make all the data processing onboard in real time[1] The Virtex4-SX FPGAs offer designers a low cost and feature rich platform for interfacing with high speed Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). Interfacing high speed ADCs can present several challenges to designers including: DDR to SDR Conversion, LVDS Buffers, Tight Timing Margins, and High Data Rates in FPGA[5].As the need for data bandwidth increases for end systems, data transmission rates continue to increase for Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) and the associated FPGA solution to interface to the ADCs and other parts of the system.AD7671 features a very high sampling rate mode (Warp) and, for asynchronous conversion rate applications, a fast mode (Normal) and, for low power applications, a reduced power mode (Impulse) where the power is scaled with the throughput[8]. It is fabricated using Analog Devices high-performance, 0.6 micron CMOS process, with correspondingly low cost.","doi":"10.1109/WICT.2011.6141428","publicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6132196/6141189/06141428.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICT.2011.6141428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interfacing 16-bit 1-MSPS CMOS ADC to FPGA based signal processing card","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141428/","displayDocTitle":"Interfacing 16-bit 1-MSPS CMOS ADC to FPGA based signal processing card","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12508152","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141428/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interfacing 16-bit 1-MSPS CMOS ADC to FPGA based signal processing card","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"rp222P565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061576S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6132196","isNumber":"6141189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6132196","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6141189","articleId":"6141428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6141431,"authors":[{"name":"Akhter Mohiuddin Rather","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"lastName":"Akhter Mohiuddin Rather","id":"37088326575"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0126-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0127-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0125-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6141431","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141431","abstract":"This paper presents a prediction based neural networks approach for stock returns.

A dedicated indoor atmospheric chamber, replicating the outdoor environment, is being used to evaluate the FSO link performance under the fog condition. Theoretical analysis supported by the experimental evaluation has been carried out for the intensity modulation/direct detection on-off keying non-return-to-zero (OOK-NRZ), OOK return-to-zero (OOK-RZ) and four pulse position modulation (4-PPM) modulation formats at the Ethernet baseline data-rate. The results shown indicate that the 4-PPM signalling scheme is the most robust to the fog attenuation due to its high peak-to-average power ratio. Moreover, results also show the potential of the indoor atmospheric chamber to replicate outdoor atmospheric effects (such as fog) and be able to quickly characterise and assess the FSO system under a controlled environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141489/","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6141489/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12577167","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ethernet FSO Communications Link Performance Study Under a Controlled Fog Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ethernet FSO Communications Link Performance Study Under a Controlled Fog Environment","sourcePdf":"408-cl1203-perez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058053S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6164481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6164481","articleId":"6141489","onlineDate":"27 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6141490,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Wu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South East University, Nanjing, China","Institute of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37595599700"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South East University, Nanjing, China","Institute of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Jiaheng Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539031300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6141490","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Games","Ad hoc networks","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Educational institutions","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","Pareto analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-constrained ad hoc networks","correlated equilibrium","CE-based distributed cooperation policy selection game","Pareto optimal","global energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","cooperative communication","energy efficiency","game theory","correlated equilibrium"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141490","abstract":"In this letter, we propose a distributed cooperation policy selection scheme for energy-constrained ad hoc networks.

Firstly, a precoding matrix is designed for multiuser interference suppression, with the help of the QR decomposition of generalized MMSE channel inversion. And then, using a signal leakage criterion, the second precoding matrix is designed to suppress OCI and residual MUI. The proposed algorithm can avoid user feedback in multiuser TDD MIMO systems.

We adopt the Viral Trait Spreading Framework for human intervention in the GA operations. Firstly, we classify GAs operation and then put each group of operation in the Framework. Most of all genetic algorithm operations fall into the Trait Adoption component. We optimized the design of genetic representation and genetic operators to tackle the fixed element constraint and row permutation constraint of Sudoku puzzle. Then, we implemented our approach in net logo, a multiagent programmable modeling environment. Experiment results showed that GA is capable of finding the optimal solution and the human intervention through Viral Trait Spreading Framework guides the GA in searching processes in the narrower search space.","doi":"10.1109/ICI.2011.33","pdfPath":"/iel5/6141507/6141640/06141665.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"154","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Informatics and Computational Intelligence","publicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Informatics and Computational Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICI.2011.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guiding Genetic Algorithm via Viral Trait Spreading for Solving Sudoku Puzzle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Guiding Genetic Algorithm via Viral Trait Spreading for Solving Sudoku Puzzle","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12508334","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6141665/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guiding Genetic Algorithm via Viral Trait Spreading for Solving Sudoku Puzzle","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"4618a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090988S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6141507","isNumber":"6141640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6141507","xplore-issue":"6141640","articleId":"6141665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6141670,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, RC alone fails to track any non-periodic reference signal. Another control scheme such as Model Reference Control (MRC) or Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) is required to do such task. MRC is employed when the plant parameters are known, while MRAC is used when the plant parameters are unknown. Therefore, MRC/MRAC needs to be combined with RC in order to simultaneously track any reference signal (not necessarily periodic) and reject the periodic disturbance. The design of RC mostly assumes the constant frequency of disturbance which leads to the selection of a fixed sampling period. In practical, disturbance is possibly time-varying in frequency. The sampling period has to be carefully adjusted in order to keep the number of samples per period remains constant. This sampling period adjustments change the plant parameters. This paper proposes the design of MRAC combined with RC for system subject to periodic disturbance with time-varying frequency. As a preliminary, the design of MRC combined with RC is also discussed here.","doi":"10.1109/ICI.2011.38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICI.2011.38","startPage":"185","endPage":"190","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Informatics and Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/6141507/6141640/06141670.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Informatics and Computational Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Repetitive Control of System Subject to Periodic Disturbance with Time-Varying Frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Repetitive Control of System Subject to Periodic Disturbance with Time-Varying Frequency","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141670/","accessionNumber":"12508339","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141670/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Repetitive Control of System Subject to Periodic Disturbance with Time-Varying Frequency","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"4618a185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088862S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6141507","isNumber":"6141640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6141507","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6141640","articleId":"6141670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6141691,"authors":[{"name":"Siti Amely Jumaat","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia","Faculty of Electrical and Engineering, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Siti Amely","lastName":"Jumaat","id":"37946761800"},{"name":"Ismail Musirin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Musirin","id":"37294282200"},{"name":"Muhammad Mutadha Othman","affiliation":["Fac. of Electr.

In recent years, this topic has been widely studied by using various mathematical theories. The employed theory decides the objective of optimization, complexity and performance, so it is a must to understand the potential mathematical theories and choose the appropriate one for obtaining the best result. Therefore, this paper systematically studies the most important mathematical theories used for modeling the network selection problem in the literature. With a carefully designed unified scenario, we compare the schemes of various mathematical theories and discuss the ways to benefit from combining multiple of them together. Furthermore, an integrated scheme using multiple attribute decision making as the core of the selection procedure is proposed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6449396/06141834.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2012.010912.00044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2012.010912.00044","startPage":"271","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical Modeling for Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks \u2014 A Tutorial","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141834/","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical Modeling for Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks \u2014 A Tutorial","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141834/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13284899","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2013","publicationDate":"First Quarter 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical Modeling for Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks \u2014 A Tutorial","sourcePdf":"16kuo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139097S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6449396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"6449396","articleId":"6141834","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6141994,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"A.

In the general problem formulation, a minimum information rate must be guaranteed for a prioritized user whose channel state information (CSI) is known, while the data rate for the other user with completely unknown CSI is \"best-effort.\" The drawbacks of the classic spatial water-filling algorithm are discussed, and two modified water-filling algorithms are proposed that either balance the required transmit power with the number of spatial dimensions available for each user, or minimize the number of transmit spatial dimensions allocated for the prioritized user. We then specialize to applications in the MIMO wiretap channel, the MIMO multiuser downlink channel, and spectrum underlay in MIMO cognitive radio networks, where existing methods are not applicable under the asymmetric CSI scenario. Numerical results verify the performance advantages of the proposed transmission schemes for each of these case studies.","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.012712.110227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6182606/06141994.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.012712.110227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6182606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Waterfilling Algorithms for MIMO Spatial Multiplexing with Asymmetric CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6141994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6141994/","displayDocTitle":"Modified Waterfilling Algorithms for MIMO Spatial Multiplexing with Asymmetric CSI","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12656229","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6141994/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Waterfilling Algorithms for MIMO Spatial Multiplexing with Asymmetric CSI","sourcePdf":"089-wcl1204-mukherjee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058378S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6182606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6182606","articleId":"6141994","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6141996,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas P.

In this paper, we show that the LSM can also be exploited to devise a novel effective approximation of the scattering phenomenon, that leads to a new noniterative linear inversion method for the estimation of the target's electric contrast. Since the introduced approximation relies on the broad applicability of the LSM, the proposed inversion method is suitable to tackle inverse scattering problems involving nonweak scatterers. As such, it represents an innovative, yet effective, way to tackle quantitative imaging. Examples with numerical and experimental data are given to show the performance of the approach. In particular, results obtained with Fresnel data-sets show that the proposed method is capable of successfully imaging targets which have been so far processed using nonlinear iterative schemes and taking advantage of frequency diversity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6178353/06142024.pdf","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2186250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2186250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Linear Sampling Method as a Way to Quantitative Inverse Scattering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Inverse problems","Equations","Scattering","Image reconstruction","Sampling methods","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","electromagnetic wave scattering","estimation theory","inverse problems","iterative methods","sampling methods","shape recognition","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear sampling method","quantitative inverse scattering","targets shape","noniterative linear inversion method","target electric contrast estimation","nonweak scatterers","quantitative imaging","Fresnel data-sets show","nonlinear iterative scheme","frequency diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Born approximation","electromagnetic scattering inverse problem","linear sampling method","microwave tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Linear Sampling Method as a Way to Quantitative Inverse Scattering","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6142024/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639383","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Linear Sampling Method as a Way to Quantitative Inverse Scattering","sourcePdf":"tap-crocco-2186250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069609S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6178353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6178353","articleId":"6142024","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6142025,"authors":[{"name":"Sema Dumanli","affiliation":["Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6178353/6142025/6142025-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sema Dumanli (M'11) was born in Elazig, Turkey, in 1984.

Because of the statistical environment created inside a reverberation chamber, they offer a unique test facility. In particular, these chambers are ideally suited for performing radiated power measurements of either an antenna or device under test, and as such, it is possible to determine the efficiency of antennas. There have been several reverberation chamber techniques proposed over the years for measuring the antenna efficiency; however, these techniques require either the use of a reference antenna (i.e., an antenna with a known efficiency) and/or require the assumption that the two antennas used in the test have identical efficiencies. In this paper, we present three different approaches for determining both the radiation and total efficiencies of an unknown antenna that overcome these limitations and assumptions. We present a one-antenna approach, a two-antenna approach, and a three-antenna approach. We present measured data for three different antennas in order to compare these three approaches. We also discuss the uncertainties related to these types of measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2186263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6178353/06142030.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2186263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178353","startPage":"1758","endPage":"1770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverberation Chamber Techniques for Determining the Radiation and Total Efficiency of Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reverberation Chamber Techniques for Determining the Radiation and Total Efficiency of Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639389","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6142030/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverberation Chamber Techniques for Determining the Radiation and Total Efficiency of Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-holloway-2186263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082581S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6178353","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"6178353","articleId":"6142030","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":6142031,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Honma","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Iwate University, Morioka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6178353/6142031/6142031-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naoki Honma (M'00) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan in 1996, 1998, and 2005, respectively.","In 1998, he joined the NTT Radio Communication Systems Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), Yokosuka, Japan.

This method uses the channel state information at the receivers and predicts the channel even at the parasitic antennas that have tunable reactances instead of receivers. The channel prediction accuracy is investigated by considering the effect of the noise, and it is found that the channel at the parasitic antennas is well predicted from a few trials without recourse to iterated measurements when the signal to noise ratio is higher than 20 dB. The results of the simulation and measurement show that the interference can be suppressed even when the estimation accuracy is affected by the noise if the number of trials is sufficient. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a fourfold channel capacity improvement and 10 dB improvement in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) compared to two antennas without the parasitic antennas .","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6178353/06142031.pdf","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2186217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2186217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Control Method of Parasitic Antennas Using Noniterative Algorithm in Multiantenna System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Training","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","interference suppression","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast control method","parasitic antennas","noniterative algorithm","multiantenna system","noniterative measurement","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","channel prediction accuracy","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive array","channel state information (CSI)","mulitple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","tunable reactance device"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fast Control Method of Parasitic Antennas Using Noniterative Algorithm in Multiantenna System","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6142031/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639390","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Control Method of Parasitic Antennas Using Noniterative Algorithm in Multiantenna System","sourcePdf":"tap-honma-2186217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089204S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6178353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6178353","articleId":"6142031","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6142040,"authors":[{"name":"Fulai Liu","affiliation":["Engineering Optimization & Smart Antenna Institute, Northeastern University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6178353/6142040/6142040-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fulai Liu was born in Hebei, China, in 1975.

An effective spatial differencing method is addressed, for the DOA estimation problem of a number of uncorrelated and coherent narrowband signals simultaneously impinging on the far field of a uniform linear array (ULA). In the proposed method, the uncorrelated sources are firstly estimated using conventional subspace methods, and then they are eliminated by exploiting the spatial differencing technique, that is, only coherent components remain in the spatial differencing matrix.

A symmetric two-layer, single-input inexpensive three-element array at 1-GHz employing varactors as tuning mechanisms are designed, fabricated, and measured. The driven element is mutually coupled to two parasitic elements in the H-plane. The varactors are used to control the mutual coupling and beam scanning and to maintain resonance at 1 GHz. A continuous scanning range of -15 + 15\u00b0 is measured with maintained impedance matching and radiation pattern integrity. The low cost of diode varactors, used in place of expensive phase shifters, allows for more economic fabrication.

The method is based on the application of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), which is an estimator capable of estimating the unknown model parameters during severe dynamic changes in the system. A particular advantage of using the UKF is the straightforward estimation procedure, which does not require linearization of the nonlinear signal model. This is an important feature as it improves the accuracy of the method during network transients. The nonlinear state-space parameter model for instantaneous power, taking into account the fundamental components of the system voltages and currents, is used as a starting point for the estimation of the power components and frequency. In the instantaneous power parameter model, the system frequency is considered to be an unknown model parameter, and it is estimated simultaneously with the other unknown model parameters: active and apparent power and the power angle. This resulted in an efficient numerical algorithm for the estimation of power components, which is not sensitive to variations of system frequency. The new estimator has been tested through computer simulations and by using data records obtained under laboratory conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2179342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2179342","startPage":"952","endPage":"962","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6165484/06142065.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Frequency and Fundamental Power Components Using an Unscented Kalman Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Frequency and Fundamental Power Components Using an Unscented Kalman Filter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142065/","accessionNumber":"12576975","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142065/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Frequency and Fundamental Power Components Using an Unscented Kalman Filter","sourcePdf":"tim-terzija-2179342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6165484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6165484","articleId":"6142065","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6142067,"authors":[{"name":"Alekh Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Alekh Agarwal received the B.

Given the extensive use of convex optimization in machine learning and statistics, gaining an understanding of these complexity-theoretic issues is important. In this paper, we study the complexity of stochastic convex optimization in an oracle model of computation. We introduce a new notion of discrepancy between functions, and use it to reduce problems of stochastic convex optimization to statistical parameter estimation, which can be lower bounded using information-theoretic methods. Using this approach, we improve upon known results and obtain tight minimax complexity estimates for various function classes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2182178","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06142067.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2182178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"3235","endPage":"3249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information-Theoretic Lower Bounds on the Oracle Complexity of Stochastic Convex Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Information-Theoretic Lower Bounds on the Oracle Complexity of Stochastic Convex Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142067/","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6142067/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12670019","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information-Theoretic Lower Bounds on the Oracle Complexity of Stochastic Convex Optimization","sourcePdf":"tit-agarwal-2182178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091411S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6142067","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6142070,"authors":[{"name":"Yeow-Khiang Chia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yeow-Khiang Chia received his M.

The inner bound is shown to be tight for a class of reversely degraded broadcast channels and when both legitimate receivers are less noisy than the third receiver. The second setup investigated in this paper is when the confidential message is to be sent to one receiver and kept secret from the other two receivers. Achievability in this case follows from Wyner wiretap channel coding and indirect decoding.

This outer bound is developed for the discrete-memoryless case and evaluated for a Gaussian channel setting. An achievable region is subsequently determined for a partially cognitive radio channel, and the outer bound on the capacity region is compared with the achievable rate in a Gaussian channel.

Given a weight parameter, we are interested in bounding the number of Reed-Muller codewords with weight up to the given parameter; and given a received word and a distance parameter, we are interested in bounding the size of the list of Reed-Muller codewords that are within that distance from the received word. Obtaining tight bounds for the weight distribution of Reed-Muller codes has been a long standing open problem in coding theory, dating back to 1976. In this work, we make a new connection between computer science techniques used to study low-degree polynomials and these coding theory questions. This allows us to resolve the weight distribution and list-decoding size of Reed-Muller codes for all distances. Previous results could only handle bounded distances: Azumi, Kasami, and Tokura gave bounds on the weight distribution which hold up to 2.5 times the minimal distance of the code; and Gopalan, Klivans, and Zuckerman gave bounds on the list-decoding size which hold up to the Johnson bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06142078.pdf","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2184841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2184841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weight Distribution and List-Decoding Size of Reed\u2013Muller Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Polynomials","Upper bound","Approximation algorithms","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","polynomials","Reed-Muller codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weight distribution parameter","list-decoding size","Reed-Muller codes","distance parameter","word parameter","coding theory","computer science techniques","low-degree polynomials","Johnson bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["List decoding","Reed\u2013Muller codes","weight distributions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Weight Distribution and List-Decoding Size of Reed\u2013Muller Codes","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6142078/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12670028","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weight Distribution and List-Decoding Size of Reed\u2013Muller Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-kaufman-2184841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08453S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6142078","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6142079,"authors":[{"name":"Robert L.

Each sensor node in the network samples the sound field, quantizes the samples and transmits the encoded samples to some central unit, which computes an estimate of the original sound field based on the information received from all the microphones. Our analysis is based on the spectral properties of the sound field, which are induced by the physics of wave propagation and have a significant impact on the efficiency of the chosen sampling lattice and coding scheme. As field acquisition by a sensor network typically implies spatio-temporal sampling of the field, a multidimensional sampling theorem for homogeneous random fields with compactly supported spectral measures is proved. To assess the loss of information implied by source coding, rate distortion functions for various coding schemes and sampling lattices are determined. In particular, centralized coding, independent coding and some multiterminal schemes are compared. Under the assumption of spectral whiteness of the sound field, it is shown that sampling with a quincunx lattice followed by independent coding is optimal as it achieves the lower bound given by centralized coding.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2184849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2184849","startPage":"3198","endPage":"3214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06142079.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Sampling and Coding for Distributed Acoustic Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"On Sampling and Coding for Distributed Acoustic Sensing","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142079/","accessionNumber":"12670029","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142079/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Sampling and Coding for Distributed Acoustic Sensing","sourcePdf":"tit-konsbruck-2184849-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084923S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6142079","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6142084,"authors":[{"name":"Van Khanh Nguyen","affiliation":["Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Edinburgh, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Van Khanh Nguyen received the B.E. degree (with honors) in computer systems engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Adelaide, Adelaide, S.A., Australia, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.

By using the moment-generating function (MGF)-based approach, we derive a number of closed-form expressions for the pairwise error probability (PEP) of the DSTM in various fading environments. For spatially independent channels, we derive a closed-form expression for the exact PEP of the DSTM for both slow- and fast-fading cases. In the case of fast-fading channels, we show that an irreducible error floor exists in the PEP and in the block error rate of the DSTM, and derive a closed-form expression for the PEP error floor in terms of the fading rate. For spatially correlated channels, we derive a new closed-form expression for the PEP at asymptotically high signal-to-noise ratios and show that an existing asymptotic PEP expression derived by the residue method can also be obtained by using the MGF-based approach. Finally, we use computer simulations to verify the theoretical results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Closed-form solutions","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","modulation","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential space-time modulation","Rayleigh fading channels","moment-generating function-based approach","closed-form expressions","pairwise error probability","spatially independent channels","slow-fading cases","fast-fading cases","fast-fading channels","signal-to-noise ratios","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block error rate (BLER)","differential modulation","error floor","moment-generating function (MGF)","pairwise error probability (PEP)","space\u2013time modulated constellation","union bound"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2184635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06142084.pdf","startPage":"2620","endPage":"2632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2184635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Differential Space\u2013Time Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Differential Space\u2013Time Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142084/","volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142084/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12670033","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Differential Space\u2013Time Modulation","sourcePdf":"tit-nguyen-2184635-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106162S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6142084","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6142088,"authors":[{"name":"Galen Reeves","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Galen Reeves (M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University in 2005 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California at Berkeley in 2007 and 2011 respectively.

In the high-dimensional setting, it is known that recovery with a vanishing fraction of errors is impossible if the measurement rate and the per-sample signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are finite constants, independent of the vector length. In this paper, it is shown that recovery with an arbitrarily small but constant fraction of errors is, however, possible, and that in some cases computationally simple estimators are near-optimal. Bounds on the measurement rate needed to attain a desired fraction of errors are given in terms of the SNR and various key parameters of the unknown vector for several different recovery algorithms. The tightness of the bounds, in a scaling sense, as a function of the SNR and the fraction of errors, is established by comparison with existing information-theoretic necessary bounds. Near optimality is shown for a wide variety of practically motivated signal models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06142088.pdf","startPage":"3065","endPage":"3092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2184848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2184848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sampling Rate-Distortion Tradeoff for Sparsity Pattern Recovery in Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Distortion measurement","Maximum likelihood estimation","Noise measurement","Rate-distortion","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","distortion","sampling methods","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling rate-distortion tradeoff","sparsity pattern recovery","compressed sensing","sparse vector","noisy linear measurement","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","message passing algorithms","model selection","random matrix theory","sparsity","support recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Sampling Rate-Distortion Tradeoff for Sparsity Pattern Recovery in Compressed Sensing","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6142088/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12670037","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sampling Rate-Distortion Tradeoff for Sparsity Pattern Recovery in Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tit-reeves-2184848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.196912S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6142088","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6142091,"authors":[{"name":"Avi Steiner","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Avi Steiner (S'02\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc.

The analysis focuses on the case of many users, and large spreading sequences such that their ratio, which is the system load, is kept fixed. Spectral efficiency of practical linear detectors such as match-filter and decorrelator employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver is derived. This is used to extend the notion of strongest users detectors for SIC receivers. The strongest users detectors system design relies on an outage approach where each user transmits in a single layer (fixed rate), and only users experiencing good channel conditions may be reliably decoded, while the other users are in outage, i.e., not decoded. In this scheme, iterative SIC decoding is studied, and it is shown that for equal power users, the optimal rate allocation, for maximizing the expected spectral efficiency, is equal rates for all users. This outage approach analysis is extended for multilayer coding broadcast approach per user. The expected sum-rate, under iterative decoding with linear multiuser detectors, is optimized, and the optimal layering power distribution is obtained. For small system loads, the achievable spectral efficiency with the continuous broadcast approach and a linear matched filter detector exhibits significant gains over the single layer coding approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06142091.pdf","startPage":"2850","endPage":"2873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2184663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2184663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Spectral Efficiency of Successive Cancellation With Linear Multiuser Detection for Randomly Spread CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon carbide","Decoding","Fading","Iterative decoding","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decoding","encoding","fading channels","interference suppression","matched filters","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","linear multiuser detection","randomly spread CDMA","randomly spread direct-sequence","code-division multiple access","flat fading channels","successive interference cancellation","SIC receivers","match-filter","decorrelator","iterative SIC decoding","optimal rate allocation","multilayer coding broadcast approach","linear multiuser detectors","optimal layering power distribution IEEE","single layer coding approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast approach","code-division multiple access (CDMA)","multilayer coding","multiuser detection","successive interference cancellation (SIC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Spectral Efficiency of Successive Cancellation With Linear Multiuser Detection for Randomly Spread CDMA","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6142091/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12670039","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Spectral Efficiency of Successive Cancellation With Linear Multiuser Detection for Randomly Spread CDMA","sourcePdf":"tit-steiner-2184663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12266S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6142091","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6142094,"authors":[{"name":"Georg Taubock","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Georg Taub\u00f6ck (S'01\u2013M'07) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree and the Dr.techn. degree (with highest honors) in electrical engineering and the Dipl.-Ing. degree in mathematics (with highest honors) from Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria in 1999, 2005, and 2008, respectively.

In this paper, we investigate the influence of these properties on important information theoretic quantities such as entropy, divergence, and capacity. We prove two maximum entropy theorems that strengthen previously known results. The proof of the first maximum entropy theorem is based on the so-called circular analog of a given complex-valued random vector. The introduction of the circular analog is additionally supported by a characterization theorem that employs a minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. In the proof of the second maximum entropy theorem, results about the second-order structure of complex-valued random vectors are exploited. Furthermore, we address the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Regardless of the specific distribution of the channel parameters (noise vector and channel matrix, if modeled as random), we show that the capacity-achieving input vector is circular for a broad range of MIMO channels (including coherent and noncoherent scenarios). Finally, we investigate the situation of an improper and Gaussian distributed noise vector. We compute both capacity and capacity-achieving input vector and show that improperness increases capacity, provided that the complementary covariance matrix is exploited. Otherwise, a capacity loss occurs, for which we derive an explicit expression.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2184638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","startPage":"2729","endPage":"2744","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06142094.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2184638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex-Valued Random Vectors and Channels: Entropy, Divergence, and Capacity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Covariance matrix","Entropy","Matrix decomposition","MIMO","Noise","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","entropy","Gaussian noise","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex-valued random vectors","circularity-noncircularity","theoretic quantity","maximum entropy theorem","circular analog","Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion","multiple-input multiple-output channels","MIMO channels","Gaussian distributed noise vector","capacity-achieving input vector","complementary covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","circular","circular analog","differential entropy","improper","Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","mutual information","noncircular","proper"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Complex-Valued Random Vectors and Channels: Entropy, Divergence, and Capacity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6142094/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12670041","publicationDate":"May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex-Valued Random Vectors and Channels: Entropy, Divergence, and Capacity","sourcePdf":"tit-tauboeck-2184638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126053S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6142094","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6142095,"authors":[{"name":"Genyuan Wang","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Genyuan Wang received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in Mathematics from Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, China, in 1985 and 1988, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, in 1998.

There are many different types of codes available for two-transmitter antennas, such as cyclotomic space-time block codes, the golden space-time block code, and rotation-based space-time block codes. In this paper, a more general space-time block code design scheme, which is called quadratic space-time block coding, is proposed for the two-transmitter antennas using quadratic field extension. The optimal design of the quadratic space-time block codes in terms of a diversity product criterion is also presented. It is shown that the optimal quadratic space-time block codes designed in this paper do not belong to the existing space-time block code family such as the cyclotomic, golden, and rotation-based space-time block codes. The simulation results demonstrate that the average codeword error rate of the optimal quadratic space-time block code attains about 0.5 dB signal to noise ratio gain over those of the optimal cyclotomic and golden space-time block codes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2184633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6200408/06142095.pdf","startPage":"4005","endPage":"4013","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2184633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Block Code Designs Based on Quadratic Field Extension for Two-Transmitter Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Block Code Designs Based on Quadratic Field Extension for Two-Transmitter Antennas","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6142095/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12728168","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Block Code Designs Based on Quadratic Field Extension for Two-Transmitter Antennas","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2184633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081954S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6200408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6200408","articleId":"6142095","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6142096,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Ke","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Ke","id":"37302525400"},{"name":"Zhengdao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengdao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6142096","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":834},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Interference channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","MIMO communication","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degrees of freedom","two-user MIMO Z","full interference channels","reconfigurable antennas","channel state information at transmitter","antenna mode switching","space-frequency coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna mode switching","degrees of freedom (DoF) region","interference channel","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","reconfigurable antenna"]}],"abstract":"We study the degrees of freedom (DoF) regions of two-user multiple-input multiple-output Z and full interference channels in this paper. We assume that the receivers always have perfect channel state information. We first derive the DoF region of Z interference channel with channel state information at transmitter (CSIT). For full interference channel without CSIT, the DoF region has been fully characterized recently and it is shown that the previously known outer bound is not achievable. In this paper, we investigate the no-CSIT case further by assuming that one transmitter has the ability of antenna mode switching. We obtain the DoF region as a function of the number of available antenna modes and reveal the incremental gain in DoF that each additional antenna mode can bring. It is shown that, in certain cases, the reconfigurable antennas can increase the DoF. In these cases, the DoF region is maximized when the number of modes is at least equal to the number of receive antennas at the corresponding receiver, in which case the previous outer bound is achieved. In all cases, we propose systematic constructions of the beamforming and nulling matrices for achieving the DoF region. The constructions bear an interesting space-frequency coding interpretation.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2185483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6200408/06142096.pdf","startPage":"3766","endPage":"3779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2185483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Regions of Two-User MIMO Z and Full Interference Channels: The Benefit of Reconfigurable Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142096/","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Regions of Two-User MIMO Z and Full Interference Channels: The Benefit of Reconfigurable Antennas","volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12728169","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom Regions of Two-User MIMO Z and Full Interference Channels: The Benefit of Reconfigurable Antennas","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2185483-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062632S","chronDate":"June  2012","isNumber":"6200408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"6142096","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6142108,"authors":[{"name":"Yanhua Wu","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6410053/6142108/6142108-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanhua Wu received the Bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree jointly from City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, and the University of Science and Technology of China in 2011.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China.

The use of optical tweezers to transfer cells to user-defined goal positions is useful in many biomedical applications. In this paper, we investigate how to automatically transport biological cells using robotically controlled optical tweezers. We characterize the forces applied to a trapped cell by a dynamic viscous drag force method, which provides us insight into information on optimal motion parameters. To prevent the cell from escaping the optical trap and to ensure high efficiency in cell movement, a proportional-integral (PI) scheme, designed based on calibrated dynamic parameters, is used to determine the ideal movement velocity of the cell. The PI scheme utilizes a feedback of the actual cell displacement from the laser focus. Finally, a modified A* algorithm is adopted for path planning during automated cell transportation. Experiments are finally performed to verify the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13219910","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142108/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics Analysis and Motion Planning for Automated Cell Transportation With Optical Tweezers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics Analysis and Motion Planning for Automated Cell Transportation With Optical Tweezers","sourcePdf":"tmech-sun-2181856-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07285S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6410053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6410053","articleId":"6142108","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6142115,"authors":[{"name":"John R.

The gripper passively conforms to the shape of a target object, then vacuum-hardens to grip it rigidly, later utilizing positive pressure to reverse this transition-releasing the object and returning to a deformable state. We describe the mechanical design and implementation of this gripper and quantify its performance in real-world testing situations. By using both positive and negative pressure, we demonstrate performance increases of up to 85% in reliability, 25% in error tolerance, and the added capability to shoot objects by fast ejection. In addition, multiple objects are gripped and placed at once while maintaining their relative distance and orientation.

In this paper, we study multicast with single and multiple data items in DTNs from a social network perspective, develop analytical models for multicast relay selection, and furthermore investigate the essential difference between multicast and unicast in DTNs. The proposed approach selects relays according to their capabilities, measured by social-based metrics, for forwarding data to the destinations. The design of social-based metrics exploits social network concepts such as node centrality and social community, and the selected relays ensure achieving the required data delivery ratio within the given time constraint.

Traditionally, the DNOs try to maximize the technical performance of the distribution network, but it is evident that the first step in optimizing a quantity is being able to calculate it. The DG investment/operation which is performed by distributed generation operators/owners (DGOs) (under unbundling rules) has made this task more complicated. This is mainly because the DNO is faced with the uncertainties related to the decisions of DG investors/operators where some of them can be probabilistically modeled while the others are possibilistically treated. This paper proposes a hybrid possibilistic-probabilistic DG impact assessment tool which takes into account the uncertainties associated with investment and operation of renewable and conventional DG units on distribution networks. This tool would be useful for DNOs to deal with the uncertainties which some of them can be modeled probabilistically and some of them are described possibilistically. The proposed method has been tested on a test system and a large-scale real distribution network to demonstrate its strength and flexibility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Possibilistic-Scenario Model for DG Impact Assessment on Distribution Networks in an Uncertain Environment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2180933","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6243218/06142135.pdf","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2180933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6243218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Possibilistic-Scenario Model for DG Impact Assessment on Distribution Networks in an Uncertain Environment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6142135/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12866561","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Possibilistic-Scenario Model for DG Impact Assessment on Distribution Networks in an Uncertain Environment","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-soroudi-2180933-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087549S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6243218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6243218","articleId":"6142135","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6142141,"authors":[{"name":"Joon-Sung Yang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6414677/6142141/6142141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joon-Sung Yang (S'05\u2013M'09) received the B.S. degree from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, all in electrical and computer engineering.","He is currently with Intel Corporation, Austin, TX.

It exploits the fact that is it not necessary to capture error-free data in the trace buffer since that information can be obtained from simulation. A selective data capture method is proposed in this paper that only captures debug data during clock cycles in which errors are present. The proposed debug method requires only three debug sessions. The first session estimates a rough error rate, the second session identifies a set of suspect clock cycles where errors may be present, and the third session captures the suspect clock cycles in the trace buffer. The suspect clock cycles are determined through a 2-D compaction technique using multiple-input signature register signatures and cycling register signatures. Intersecting both signatures generates a small number of suspect clock cycles for which the trace buffer needs to capture. The effective observation window of the trace buffer can be expanded significantly, by up to orders of magnitude. Experimental results indicate very significant increases in the effective observation window for a trace buffer can be obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6414677/06142141.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2183399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2183399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6414677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Trace Buffer Observation via Selective Data Capture Using 2-D Compaction for Post-Silicon Debug","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Registers","Compaction","Buffer storage","Error analysis","Debugging","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","clocks","compaction","elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit testing","logic testing","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trace buffer observation","debug data capture","post-silicon debug","trace buffers","error-free data","debug method","rough error rate","suspect clock cycles","2-D compaction technique","multiple-input signature register signatures","cycling register signatures","effective observation window"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-D compaction","observation window","post-silicon debug","selective data capture","trace buffer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improved Trace Buffer Observation via Selective Data Capture Using 2-D Compaction for Post-Silicon Debug","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6142141/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13250653","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Trace Buffer Observation via Selective Data Capture Using 2-D Compaction for Post-Silicon Debug","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yang-2183399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107035S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6414677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6414677","articleId":"6142141","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6142142,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche 8506, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00c9lectricit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud XI, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6169213/6142142/6142142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Di Renzo (SM'05\u2013A'07\u2013M'09) was born in L'Aquila, Italy, in 1978.

More precisely, a comprehensive analytical framework to compute the average bit error probability (ABEP) is introduced, which can be used for any MIMO setup, for arbitrary correlated fading channels, and for generic modulation schemes. It is shown that, when compared with state-of-the-art literature, our framework 1) has more general applicability over generalized fading channels, 2) is, in general, more accurate as it exploits an improved union-bound method, and, 3) more importantly, clearly highlights interesting fundamental trends about the performance of SM, which are difficult to capture with available frameworks. For example, by focusing on the canonical reference scenario with independent identically distributed Rayleigh fading, we introduce very simple formulas that yield insightful design information on the optimal modulation scheme to be used for the signal constellation diagram, as well as highlight the different roles played by the bit mapping on the signal and spatial constellation diagrams. Numerical results show that, for many MIMO setups, SM with phase-shift-keying (PSK) modulation outperforms SM with quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM), which is a result never reported in the literature. In addition, by exploiting asymptotic analysis, closed-form formulas of the performance gain of SM over other single-antenna transmission technologies are provided. Numerical results show that SM can outperform many single-antenna systems and that, for any transmission rate, there is an optimal allocation of the information bits onto spatial and signal constellation diagrams. Furthermore, by focusing on the Nakagami-fading scenario with generically correlated fading, we show that fading severity plays a very important role in determining the diversity gain of SM. In particular, the performance gain over single-antenna systems increases for fading channels less severe than Rayleigh fading, whereas it gets smaller for more severe fading channels. In addition, it is shown that the impact of fading correlation at the transmitter is reduced for less severe fading. Finally, analytical frameworks and claims are substantiated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","volume":"61","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12592447","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6142142/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bit Error Probability of SM-MIMO Over Generalized Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Error Probability of SM-MIMO Over Generalized Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-direnzo-2186158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164067S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6169213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"6169213","articleId":"6142142","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6142167,"authors":[{"name":"Ren Duan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, China","School of Information, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Duan","id":"38242520900"},{"name":"Xiaojiang Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403981000"},{"name":"Tianzhang Xing","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Tianzhang","lastName":"Xing","id":"38236001200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1976-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6142167","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Internet","Computer architecture","Monitoring","Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS architecture","quality of service","application-oriented IoT","Internet of Things","QoS requirement","IoT application service","IoT transmission network","QoS agent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IOT","QoS","Architecture"]}],"abstract":"The application-oriented IoT is an integration of various kinds of technologies, rapidly developing in the globe.

This architecture sets QoS agent in lower layers then transmits QoS requirements, trying to guarantee the consistency as well as effectively use the existing QoS mechanisms in every layer.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.125","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142151/6142155/06142167.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS Architecture for IOT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142167/","displayDocTitle":"A QoS Architecture for IOT","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526147","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142167/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS Architecture for IOT","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4580a717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032517S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142151","isNumber":"6142155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142151","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6142155","articleId":"6142167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6142258,"authors":[{"name":"Bonnie Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bonnie","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37695219000"},{"name":"Anthony Joseph","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37272708300"},{"name":"Shankar Sastry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shankar","lastName":"Sastry","id":"37270557300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1976-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6142258","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":198,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5794},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SCADA systems","Security","Real time systems","Humans","Databases","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","critical infrastructures","process control","SCADA systems","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber attacks taxonomy","supervisory control and data acquisition systems","critical infrastructure sectors","computerized real time process control systems","geographically dispersed continuous distribution operations","cyber threats","standard IT systems","cyber induced cyber physical attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCADA","Cyber-Physical Systems","Cyber Attacks"]}],"abstract":"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition(SCADA) systems are deeply ingrained in the fabric of critical infrastructure sectors. These computerized real-time process control systems, over geographically dispersed continuous distribution operations, are increasingly subject to serious damage and disruption by cyber means due to their standardization and connectivity to other networks. However, SCADA systems generally have little protection from the escalating cyber threats. In order to understand the potential danger and to protect SCADA systems, in this paper, we highlight their difference from standard IT systems and present a set of security property goals. Furthermore, we focus on systematically identifying and classifying likely cyber attacks including cyber-induced cyber-physical attack son SCADA systems. Determined by the impact on control performance of SCADA systems, the attack categorization criteria highlights commonalities and important features of such attacks that define unique challenges posed to securing SCADA systems versus traditional Information Technology(IT) systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Taxonomy of Cyber Attacks on SCADA Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","doi":"10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.34","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142151/6142155/06142258.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Taxonomy of Cyber Attacks on SCADA Systems","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142258/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526205","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Taxonomy of Cyber Attacks on SCADA Systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4580a380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053328S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142151","isNumber":"6142155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142151","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"6142155","articleId":"6142258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6142271,"authors":[{"name":"Su Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279520100"},{"name":"Weihua Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598762900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1976-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6142271","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Vectors","Unemployment","Companies","Trajectory","Mobile handsets","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences","hidden Markov models","probability","traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","collective moving patterns","hidden Markov model based solution","abnormal people trajectory detection","outlier detection","time-varying people distribution","probability","artificial data set","real-world traffic data set","people collective behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collective Behavior","Outlier Detection"]}],"abstract":"Trajectories of people provide rich information about the collective behaviors, where the term collective behavior means the behavior of a large number of people as a whole. Abnormal people trajectories that are rarely observed may correspond with some unusual events, for instance, natural disasters, terrorism attacks, or traffic accidents. To detect such abnormal people trajectories, namely outliers, this paper presents a solution based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The motivation to use HMM for outlier detection on people trajectories is that time-varying people distribution can be modeled by using HMM and HMM can provide the probability that a sequence appears. Here, the time-varying people distributions with low probabilities to appear are regarded as outliers. Experiments with an artificial data set simulating collective behaviors and a real-world traffic data set validate the proposed solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection on Collective Moving Patterns: A Hidden Markov Model Based Solution","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","doi":"10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.25","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142151/6142155/06142271.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection on Collective Moving Patterns: A Hidden Markov Model Based Solution","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142271/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526218","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection on Collective Moving Patterns: A Hidden Markov Model Based Solution","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4580a291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064732S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142151","isNumber":"6142155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142151","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6142155","articleId":"6142271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6142292,"authors":[{"name":"Ge Yunwen","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Science College, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Yunwen","id":"38232646500"},{"name":"Wu Shaochun","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Science College, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Shaochun","id":"38095055900"},{"name":"Yuan Bowen","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Science College, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Bowen","id":"38241245800"},{"name":"Li Jiazheng","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Science College, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jiazheng","id":"38071935000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1976-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6142292","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Computers","Data models","History","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data handling","groupware","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data prefetching method","cloud user model","cloud computing data management","cloud services","cloud status","user status information","service applications","resource pools","intelligent analysis","collaborative computing technologies","user habit patterns","history records","predictive analysis","intelligent algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","User Model","Data Mining","Data Prefeching"]}],"abstract":"According to the data management of cloud computing and assign characters of dynamic resource in cloud services, we constructed a model of cloud user, cloud service and cloud status, which collects information of user status, service applications and resource pools.

Among the technological innovations, the use of digital technologies is very relevant. Digital communication systems have proven their efficiency and brought a new element in the chain of signal transmitting and receiving, the digital processor. This device offers to new radio equipments the flexibility of a programmable system. Nowadays, the behavior of a communication system can be modified by simply changing its software. This gave rising to a new radio model called Software Defined Radio (or Software-Defined Radio - SDR). In this new model, one moves to the software the task to set radio behavior, leaving to hardware only the implementation of RF front-end. Thus, the radio is no longer static, defined by their circuits and becomes a dynamic element, which may change their operating characteristics, such as bandwidth, modulation, coding rate, even modified during runtime according to software configuration. This article aims to present the use of GNU Radio software, an open-source solution for SDR specific applications, as a tool for development configurable digital radio.","doi":"10.1109/TLA.2012.6142453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/9907/6142447/06142453.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2012.6142453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introduction to the Software-defined Radio Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Introduction to the Software-defined Radio Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142453/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12509237","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introduction to the Software-defined Radio Approach","sourcePdf":"10TLA1_06GarciaReis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044479S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","isNumber":"6142447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6142453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6142535,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Hakimi","affiliation":["Syscom Laboratory, ENIT, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Hakimi","id":"38093678600"},{"name":"Mahmoud Ammar","affiliation":["Syscom Laboratory, ENIT, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Ammar","id":"37574012600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0140-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0138-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0139-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-6525"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6142535","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Detectors","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","access protocols","antenna arrays","automatic repeat request","interference suppression","MIMO communication","quality of service","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPIC","space-time rake detector","MIMO HSDPA system","generalized Alamouti code","high speed real time service quality","high speed downlink packet access","multiple transmitting antenna","multiple receiving antenna","HARQ retransmission technique","multipath parallel interference canceller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HSDPA","HARQ","QSTBC","Multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","MPIC"]}],"abstract":"It is well known that HARQ technique generates delays du to the retransmissions.

In this paper, we consider multimedia traffic transmission over shared Cognitive Radio (CR) networks using fountain codes. To share this CR infrastructure, we propose to make use of Time Division Multiple Access method based on the opportunistic spectrum sharing. Each Secondary User (SU) is assigned one time slot where he transmits with a certain probability. The given model allows each SU to transmit in the remaining slots if he has data to transfer and has missed his own slot. Therefore, the reasons for packet loss are twofold: Primary traffic interruptions and collisions between several SUs due to our specific time slot allocation. We use a redundancy-based model for link maintenance to compensate the spectrum resources loss caused by the primary traffic reclaims. Moreover, we setup up many Secondary User Links to minimize the collision effects in order to meet the QoS requirements for multimedia communication services. Numerical simulations, in view of the average Goodput, show that the system still exhibit good secondary traffic robustness despite of the presence of primary interferences and opportunistic transmission collisions.","doi":"10.1109/NGNS.2011.6142542","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Conference on Next Generation Networks and Services (NGNS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138949/6142533/06142542.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGNS.2011.6142542","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Conference on Next Generation Networks and Services (NGNS)","startPage":"72","endPage":"77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimedia traffic transmission over Cognitive Radio TDMA networks under secondary collision errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multimedia traffic transmission over Cognitive Radio TDMA networks under secondary collision errors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142542/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142542/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525058","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimedia traffic transmission over Cognitive Radio TDMA networks under secondary collision errors","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101538S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138949","isNumber":"6142533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138949","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6142533","articleId":"6142542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6142551,"authors":[{"name":"Yahia Salah","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences of Monastir, EME Laboratory, Monastir, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Yahia","lastName":"Salah","id":"38127303500"},{"name":"Rached Tourki","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences of Monastir, EME Laboratory, Monastir, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Rached","lastName":"Tourki","id":"37296886600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0140-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0138-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0139-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-6525"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6142551","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nickel","Quality of service","Routing","System-on-a-chip","Field programmable gate arrays","Bandwidth","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","network routing","network-on-chip","quality of service","scheduling","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","QoS router","networks-on-chip","interconnection problems","circuit-switched NoC","quality-of-service parameters","QoS parameters","systems-on-chips","SoC","virtual channels","transmission delays","packet-switched NoC router","priority-based scheduler","RTL level","optimal scheduling strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip","router","packet scheduling","quality-of-service guarantee","FPGA implementation","performance"]}],"abstract":"Network-on-Chip (NoC) is believed to be a solution to the existing and future interconnection problems in highly complex chips.

This paper presents a packet-switched NoC router with QoS support. It uses a priority-based scheduler to solve conflicts between multiple connections with heterogeneous traffic flows and to minimize network latency. The hardware design of the router has been implemented at the RTL level; its functionality is evaluated and QoS requirements for each service class are derived.

To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) performances, a Connection Admission Control (CAC) scheme is considered at a subscriber station. A queueing analytical framework for these admission control schemes is presented considering OFDMA-based transmission at the physical layer. Then, based on the queueing model, both the connection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and compared with their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled by a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP).

At the Industrial Surveillance Day, ASFINAG and the Alpen Adria Universitt Klagenfurt (in particular the Institute of Information Technology and the Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems) demonstrate a show case of their video-based level of service (LOS) classification for smart cameras. This LOS classification system has been developed in a joint Lakeside Labs project in Klagenfurt, Austria. It is part of a case study which aims at improving the quality of traffic messages for the two particular traffic situations level-of-service (LOS) and weather-related road conditions (WRRC) on two dedicated test tracks on Austrian motorways. Using a live connection to a smart camera at one of these test tracks, we plan to show a live demonstration for visual speed estimation and LOS classification. This demo is coordinated with our partner SLR Engineering, which provided the smart cameras for the case study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling to the final frontier: Reliability challenges in sub 20 nm technologies","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop Final Report","doi":"10.1109/IIRW.2011.6142574","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop Final Report","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138496/6142567/06142574.pdf","startPage":"xi","endPage":"xi","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIRW.2011.6142574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Scaling to the final frontier: Reliability challenges in sub 20 nm technologies","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling to the final frontier: Reliability challenges in sub 20 nm technologies","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"000xiKeynoteNigamabs.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025185S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2011","isNumber":"6142567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138496","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6142574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6142609,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These platforms are VISIR (Virtual Systems in Reality) and the iLab Shared Architecture (ISA). While VISIR delivers, among others, electronics experiments in a highly flexible online workbench where circuits can be built and tested in a similar way as in traditional hands on laboratories, ISA focuses in providing mechanisms for sharing online laboratories in a distributed Web services based architecture by managing lab session scheduling and maintenance while a experiment is executed. Opening VISIR based labs to use the standard online lab support services provided by the ISA brings several advantages to both sides.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142780/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142780/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12539213","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Work in progress \u2014 Integrating educational online lab platforms around the iLab Shared Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Work in progress \u2014 Integrating educational online lab platforms around the iLab Shared Architecture","confLoc":"Rapid City, SD, USA","sourcePdf":"1149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075902S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6129459","isNumber":"6142695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6129459","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6142695","articleId":"6142780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6142879,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio F.

This study expands on this research by examining how mathematics identity impacts the choice of engineering careers for male and female students. Our framework encompasses interest, recognition, performance, and competence as central factors that contribute to the development of mathematics identity. The data used in this study were drawn from the Factors Influencing College Success in Mathematics (FICS-Math) project; the survey included questions on students' demographics, mathematics background/experiences, interest in mathematics, and career aspirations. Results indicate that factors of mathematics interest, mathematics competence and performance, and mathematics recognition are significant predictors of the choice of an engineering career, even after controlling for SAT/ACT math scores and demographics such as parental education. Moreover, the interaction between mathematics recognition and gender is also significant with the estimate indicating that females who are recognized in mathematics are more likely to choose engineering careers. This work reaffirms the importance of mathematics to engineering career choices and furthers the discussion by looking beyond mathematics grades to ascertaining the importance of mathematics identity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6129459/6142695/06142881.pdf","startPage":"F2H-1","endPage":"F2H-5","publicationTitle":"2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2011.6142881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2011.6142881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6142881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Examining the impact of mathematics identity on the choice of engineering careers for male and female students","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engineering profession","Educational institutions","Engineering education","Mathematical model","Loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["engineering education","mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["engineering careers","mathematics background","female students","male students","students demographics","SAT/ACT math scores","mathematics recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Engineering career choice","Gender","Mathematics identity","Quantitative assessment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6142881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Examining the impact of mathematics identity on the choice of engineering careers for male and female students","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6142881/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539309","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Examining the impact of mathematics identity on the choice of engineering careers for male and female students","confLoc":"Rapid City, SD, USA","sourcePdf":"1305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053009S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6129459","isNumber":"6142695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6129459","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6142695","articleId":"6142881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6142913,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Currently only anecdotal evidence exists regarding the relationship of technical performance parameters and the quality of user experience.

In satellite communication systems, as a rule, especially in Mobile Satellite Communications (MSC) many users are active at the same time. The problem of simultaneous communications between many single or multipoint mobile satellite users, however, can be solved by using Multiple Access (MA) technique. Since the resources of the systems such as the transmitting power and the bandwidth are limited, it is advisable to use the channels with complete charge and to create a different MA to the channel. This generates a problem of summation and separation of signals in the transmission and reception parts, respectively. Deciding this problem consists in the development of orthogonal channels of transmission in order to divide signals from various users unambiguously on the reception part.","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6143206","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6102682/6143162/06143206.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6143206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6143162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) applicable for Mobile Satellite Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143206/","displayDocTitle":"Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) applicable for Mobile Satellite Communications","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12527362","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6143206/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) applicable for Mobile Satellite Communications","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"143Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050323S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6102682","isNumber":"6143162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6102682","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6143162","articleId":"6143206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6143209,"authors":[{"name":"Tomislav Mati\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Tomislav","lastName":"Mati\u0107","id":"37085774128"},{"name":"Tomislav \u0160vedek","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Tomislav","lastName":"\u0160vedek","id":"37680503700"},{"name":"Marijan Herceg","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Marijan","lastName":"Herceg","id":"38261156800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2019-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2018-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2017-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6143209","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Power harmonic filters","Harmonic analysis","Amplitude modulation","Mathematical model","Sigma delta modulation","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue multipliers","asynchronous circuits","mathematical analysis","pulse amplitude modulation","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous sigma-delta pulse amplitude modulation","duty-cycle conversion","ASDM input signal","voltage level","output pulse stream","2-input analog multiplier","ASDM-PAM analog multiplier output signal spectrum","sinusoidal input signal","DC input signal","ASDM-PAM multiplier Simulink model","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog multiplier","asynchronous sigma-delta modulation","pulse-amplitude modulation","duty-cycle"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143209","abstract":"Asynchronous sigma-delta modulation (ASDM) has been proposed as a possible solution for the amplitude to duty-cycle conversion. The information conveyed by voltage level of the ASDM input signal is converted into the duty cycle of the ASDM output signal period. Applying pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) to ASDM output pulse stream, 2-input analog multiplier can be obtained. The mean value of the output pulse stream period corresponds to the product of the ASDM input and PAM input signals. This paper gives the mathematical analysis of the ASDM-PAM analog multiplier output signal spectrum for the DC and sinusoidal input signals. It has been shown that combination of ASDM and PAM modulation generates a product of the two input signals in the baseband and around multiples of the central frequency, which can be later on efficiently filtered out. The ASDM-PAM multiplier Simulink model has been used for confirmation of the mathematical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6143209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6143209","startPage":"707","endPage":"710","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6102682/6143162/06143209.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6143162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analog multiplier based on asynchronous sigma-delta pulse amplitude modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An analog multiplier based on asynchronous sigma-delta pulse amplitude modulation","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6143209/","accessionNumber":"12527365","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143209/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analog multiplier based on asynchronous sigma-delta pulse amplitude modulation","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"146Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037716S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6102682","isNumber":"6143162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6102682","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6143162","articleId":"6143209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6143210,"authors":[{"name":"Desimir Vu\u010di\u0107","affiliation":["School of Computing, Union University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Desimir","lastName":"Vu\u010di\u0107","id":"38229053000"},{"name":"Miljko Eri\u0107","affiliation":["Department for Telecommunications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Miljko","lastName":"Eri\u0107","id":"38229051900"},{"name":"Slobodan Nedi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Slobodan","lastName":"Nedi\u0107","id":"38232370600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2019-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2018-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2017-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6143210","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Correlation","Spectral analysis","Markov processes","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Educational institutions","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic spectral analysis","OFDM-OQAM signals","cyclostationary signature","matrix-based stochastic method","Markov chain representation","cyclic spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM/OQAM","cyclostationary signature","cyclostationarity","spectral correlation","cyclic spectrum","Markov chain"]}],"abstract":"Cyclic spectral analysis of OFDM/OQAM signals with cyclostationary signature is performed by the proposed matrix-based stochastic method based on their Markov chain representation.

RPD being a fundamental part of optimal power flow problem, controls balanced voltage profile and minimises active power loss. As of its objective function, RPD problem is treated as mixed integer non linear function where metaheuristics algorithm may be fitted properly as solving tool. In this paper such an algorithm named particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been applied for solving reactive power dispatch problem. The special feature of PSO technique is its local as well as global optimization of the objective function. In this paper constriction factor is included in generalised PSO algorithm to enhance the velocity of the particle used in particle swarm optimization technique which is applied to the IEEE 14-bus system. In the test system control variable such as generator terminal voltages, transformer tap positions and the shunt capacitor placements are varied to solve the RPD problem. The obtained result is compared with previously used different optimization algorithm including generalised PSO. The comparison shows the effectiveness of the constriction factor and the practicability of the applied optimization technique in this paper.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2011.0385","startPage":"335","endPage":"339","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Intelligent Systems (SEISCON 2011)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2011.0385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6143272","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Intelligent Systems (SEISCON 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135530/6143272/06143333.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constriction factor based particle swarm optimization applied to reactive power dispatch in transmission system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143333/","displayDocTitle":"Constriction factor based particle swarm optimization applied to reactive power dispatch in transmission system","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12357116","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constriction factor based particle swarm optimization applied to reactive power dispatch in transmission system","confLoc":"Chennai","sourcePdf":"20110385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025286S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","isNumber":"6143272","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135530","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6143333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6143544,"authors":[{"name":"Djuradj Budimir","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Group, University of Westminster, London, UK"],"firstName":"Djuradj","lastName":"Budimir","id":"37275328000"},{"name":"Dmytro Bondar","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Group, University of Westminster, London, UK"],"firstName":"Dmytro","lastName":"Bondar","id":"37403546600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1498-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1499-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6143544","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Nonlinear distortion","Predistortion","Mathematical model","Polynomials","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","iterative methods","linearisation techniques","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear distortion","RF power amplifiers","wireless communications","iterative digital predistortion","baseband equalization","in-band distortion","memory effects","digital signal processing algorithm","QPSK","spectral re-growth","frequency 5 MHz","frequency 751 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distortion","high-efficiency power amplifiers","power amplifiers","digital predistortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143544","abstract":"This paper presents a new, simple and efficient technique for linearizing power amplifiers by combining iterative digital predistortion and baseband equalization.

The target of this paper is to determine the optimum BS antenna tilt angle for both the topologies, with or without repeaters with respect to different network performance metrics; and to achieve maximum SINR levels for HS-DSCH. Based on the results, addition of repeaters improves the performance of network considerably. Moreover, the optimum EDT angle for BS antenna increases to 9\u00b0 with addition of repeaters compared to 6\u00b0 in absence of repeaters. Furthermore, the nominal clover-leaf topology performs better than novel triangular topology.","doi":"10.1109/TELFOR.2011.6143558","publicationTitle":"2011 19thTelecommunications Forum (TELFOR) Proceedings of Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19thTelecommunications Forum (TELFOR) Proceedings of Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/6130662/6143488/06143558.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELFOR.2011.6143558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6143488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of repeaters and base station antenna tilt on performance of a WCDMA macro cellular network for different network topologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143558/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of repeaters and base station antenna tilt on performance of a WCDMA macro cellular network for different network topologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538442","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6143558/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of repeaters and base station antenna tilt on performance of a WCDMA macro cellular network for different network topologies","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"TELFOR20110316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052572S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6130662","isNumber":"6143488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6130662","xplore-issue":"6143488","articleId":"6143558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6143566,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Rajabi","affiliation":["K.

It is aimed to use bandwidth effectively with the use of a single bit that is feedback by the destination. In fact whenever a direct link from the source to the destination is not satisfactory for decoding (with acceptable BER), the destination requests the help of a set of suitable relays. Since reliability is one of the important issues in wireless network design, using suitable relays in cooperation leads more robustness and reliability of a wireless communication network based on cooperative diversity because cooperation only with one relay is not more reliable.

The current demands are aimed at using the Internet anytime and anywhere. The main constraint to achieving these demands is the mobility. Suppression of Doppler spreading effects caused by high velocity of moving objects represents a challenging task. Hence, in this paper we present an application of multicarrier system based on the Affine Fourier transform (AFT-MC) for transmission in aeronautical satellite channels. We analyse the AFT-MC in terms of interference suppression, spectral efficiency, data rate and bit error rate (BER) in aeronautical satellite channels. It will be shown that AFT-MC has good performance in aeronautical satellite channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the Affine Fourier Transform based multicarrier system in aeronautical satellite channels","publicationTitle":"2011 19thTelecommunications Forum (TELFOR) Proceedings of Papers","doi":"10.1109/TELFOR.2011.6143654","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19thTelecommunications Forum (TELFOR) Proceedings of Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/6130662/6143488/06143654.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELFOR.2011.6143654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6143488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Affine Fourier Transform based multicarrier system in aeronautical satellite channels","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6143654/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538531","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Affine Fourier Transform based multicarrier system in aeronautical satellite channels","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"TELFOR20110533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053199S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6130662","isNumber":"6143488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6130662","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6143488","articleId":"6143654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6143665,"authors":[{"name":"Uldis Grunde","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Uldis","lastName":"Grunde","id":"37871687800"},{"name":"Modris Greitans","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Modris","lastName":"Greitans","id":"37568146100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1498-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1499-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6143665","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143665","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Sampling methods","Electroencephalography","Brain modeling","Correlation","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantisation (signal)","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["level-crossing sampling","signal-driven sampling","nonuniformly distributed quantization levels","volume compression","targeting sporadic signals","recovered signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced signal-driven sampling","compression ratio","level-crossing sampling","non-uniformly distributed quantization levels"]}],"abstract":"We propose an advanced signal-driven sampling method that uses the level-crossing sampling technique based on the selected signal sampling and non-uniformly distributed quantization levels.

One of the characteristics that distinguishes vehicular clouds from conventional clouds is the dynamically changing amount of available resources that, in some cases, may fluctuate rather abruptly. In this work, we envision a vehicular cloud involving cars in the long-term parking lot of a typical international airport. The patrons of such a parking lot are typically on travel for several days, providing a pool of cars that can serve as the basis for a datacenter at the airport. We anticipate a park and plug scenario where the cars that participate in the vehicular cloud are plugged into a standard power outlet and are provided Ethernet connection to a central server at the airport. In order to be able to schedule resources and to assign computational tasks to the various cars in the vehicular cloud, a fundamental prerequisite is to have an accurate picture of the number of vehicles that are expected to be present in the parking lot as a function of time. What makes the problem difficult is the time-varying nature of the arrival and departure rates. In this work, we concern ourselves with predicting the parking occupancy given time-varying arrival and departure rates. Our main contribution is to provide closed forms for the probability distribution of the parking lot occupancy as a function of time, for the expected number of cars in the parking lot and its variance, and for the limiting behavior of these parameters as time increases. In addition to analytical results, we have obtained a series of empirical results that confirm the accuracy of our analytical predictions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6311386/06143927.pdf","startPage":"2067","endPage":"2080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Datacenter at the Airport: Reasoning about Time-Dependent Parking Lot Occupancy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Cloud computing","Airports","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airports","automobiles","cloud computing","computer centres","local area networks","network servers","resource allocation","traffic control","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airport data center","time-dependent parking lot occupancy","vehicles dynamic group","storage resources","user authorization","vehicular clouds","cars","long-term parking lot","international airport","park and plug scenario","standard power outlet","Ethernet connection","central server","resources scheduling","time-varying nature","arrival rates","departure rates","parking occupancy","probability distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","vehicular networks","dynamic resource availability","resource estimation","stochastic models","inhomogeneous Poisson processes","vehicular clouds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Datacenter at the Airport: Reasoning about Time-Dependent Parking Lot Occupancy","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6143927/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13014893","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Datacenter at the Airport: Reasoning about Time-Dependent Parking Lot Occupancy","sourcePdf":"ttd2012112067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074379S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6311386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6311386","articleId":"6143927","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6143928,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Bu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6311386/6143928/6143928-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Bu received the BSc and MSc degrees in computer science from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

Of great importance to RFID applications in production economics is misplaced-tag pinpointing (MTP), because misplacement errors fail optimal inventory placement and thus significantly decrease profit. The existing MTP solution [1], originally proposed from a data-processing perspective, collects and processes a large amount of data. It suffers from time inefficiency (and energy-inefficiency as well if active tags are in use). The problem of finding efficient solutions for the MTP problem from the communication protocol design perspective has never been investigated before. In this paper, we propose a series of protocols toward efficient MTP solutions in large RFID systems. The proposed protocols detect misplaced tags using reader positions instead of tag positions to guarantee the efficiency and scalability as system scale grows, because RFID readers are much fewer than tags. Considering applications that employ active tags, we further propose a solution requiring responses from only a subset of tags in favor of energy saving. We also design a distributed protocol that enables each reader to independently detect misplaced tags. We then investigate how to apply the proposed protocols in scenarios with tag mobility. To evaluate the proposed protocols, we analyze their optimal performances to demonstrate their efficiency potential and also conduct extensive simulation experiments. The results show that the proposed protocols can significantly increase the time efficiency and the energy efficiency by over 70 percent on average when compared with the best existing work.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6311386/06143928.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Misplaced-Tag Pinpointing in Large RFID Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143928/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Misplaced-Tag Pinpointing in Large RFID Systems","volume":"23","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029406","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6143928/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Misplaced-Tag Pinpointing in Large RFID Systems","sourcePdf":"ttd2012112094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095488S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6311386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6311386","articleId":"6143928","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6143930,"authors":[{"name":"Jinguang Han","affiliation":["College of Science, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China","Centre for Computer and Information Security Research, School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinguang","lastName":"Han","id":"37535076600"},{"name":"Willy Susilo","affiliation":["Centre for Computer and Information Security Research, School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Willy","lastName":"Susilo","id":"37323637000"},{"name":"Yi Mu","affiliation":["Centre for Computer and Information Security Research, School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Mu","id":"37369535100"},{"name":"Jun Yan","affiliation":["School of Information Systems and Technology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yan","id":"37293581000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"6143930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1962},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Decentralized attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a variant of a multiauthority ABE scheme where each authority can issue secret keys to the user independently without any cooperation and a central authority. This is in contrast to the previous constructions, where multiple authorities must be online and setup the system interactively, which is impractical. Hence, it is clear that a decentralized ABE scheme eliminates the heavy communication cost and the need for collaborative computation in the setup stage. Furthermore, every authority can join or leave the system freely without the necessity of reinitializing the system. In contemporary multiauthority ABE schemes, a user's secret keys from different authorities must be tied to his global identifier (GID) to resist the collusion attack. However, this will compromise the user's privacy. Multiple authorities can collaborate to trace the user by his GID, collect his attributes, then impersonate him. Therefore, constructing a decentralized ABE scheme with privacy-preserving remains a challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized key-policy ABE scheme where each authority can issue secret keys to a user independently without knowing anything about his GID. Therefore, even if multiple authorities are corrupted, they cannot collect the user's attributes by tracing his GID. Notably, our scheme only requires standard complexity assumptions (e.g., decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman) and does not require any cooperation between the multiple authorities, in contrast to the previous comparable scheme that requires nonstandard complexity assumptions (e.g., q-decisional Diffie-Hellman inversion) and interactions among multiple authorities. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first decentralized ABE scheme with privacy-preserving based on standard complexity assumptions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6311386/06143930.pdf","startPage":"2150","endPage":"2162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Protocols","Access control","Polynomials","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving decentralized key-policy ABE scheme","attribute-based encryption","secret keys","central authority","multiple authorities","collaborative computation","contemporary multiauthority schemes","global identifier","GID","collusion attack","user privacy","user attributes","standard complexity assumptions","decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman","nonstandard complexity assumptions","q-decisional Diffie-Hellman inversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attribute-based encryption","multiauthority","privacy-preserving extract protocol","access control","privacy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption","volume":"23","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13014895","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption","sourcePdf":"ttd2012112150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054072S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","isNumber":"6311386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"97","articleId":"6143930","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6143933,"authors":[{"name":"Jiazhen Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Omaha, NE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6249676/6143933/6143933-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiazhen Zhou (S\u201906, M\u201909) received the BS degree in mathematics from Shandong University, the MS degree in automatic control from Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the PhD degree in telecommunication networking from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

AMI in smart grid is a typical cyber-physical system (CPS) example, in which large amount of data from hundreds of thousands of smart meters are collected and processed through an AMI communication infrastructure. Scalability is one of the most important issues for the AMI deployment in smart grid. In this study, we introduce a new performance metric, accumulated bandwidthdistance product (ABDP), to represent the total communication resource usages. For each distributed communication architecture, we formulate an optimization problem and obtain the solutions for minimizing the total cost of the system that considers both the ABDP and the deployment cost of the meter data management system (MDMS). The simulation results indicate the significant benefits of the distributed communication architectures over the traditional centralized one. More importantly, we analyze the scalability of the total cost of the communication system (including MDMS) with regard to the traffic load on the smart meters for both the centralized and the distributed communication architectures. Through the closed form expressions obtained in our analysis, we demonstrate that the total cost for the centralized architecture scales linearly as O(\u03bbN), with N being the number of smart meters, and \u03bb being the average traffic rate on a smart meter.

We present a method for visualizing such structures, and demonstrate its utility in visualizing the abdominal aorta and its branches, whose tomographic images might be obtained by computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography, in a single 2D stylistic image, without overlaps among branches. The visualization method, termed uncluttered single-image visualization (USIV), involves optimization of geometry. This paper proposes a novel optimization technique that utilizes an interesting connection of the optimization problem regarding USIV to the protein structure prediction problem. Adopting the integer linear programming-based formulation for the protein structure prediction problem, we tested the proposed technique using 30 visualizations produced from five patient scans with representative anatomical variants in the abdominal aortic vessel tree. The novel technique can exploit commodity-level parallelism, enabling use of general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) technology that yields a significant speedup. Comparison of the results with the other optimization technique previously reported elsewhere suggests that, in most aspects, the quality of the visualization is comparable to that of the previous one, with a significant gain in the computation time of the algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6363448/06143935.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6363448","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncluttered Single-Image Visualization of Vascular Structures Using GPU and Integer Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Three dimensional displays","Biomedical imaging","Optimization","Context","Solid modeling","Graphics processing unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","computerised tomography","data visualisation","geometry","graphics processing units","integer programming","linear programming","medical image processing","parallel processing","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncluttered single-image visualization","vascular structures","GPGPU technology","general-purpose graphics processing unit technology","commodity-level parallelism","abdominal aortic vessel tree","anatomical variants","protein structure prediction problem","geometry optimization technique","USIV","2D stylistic image","magnetic resonance angiography","computed tomography","tomographic images","abdominal aorta visualization","structure visualization","3D branching structures direct projection","integer linear programming-based formulation","GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["proteins","biomedical MRI","computerised tomography","data visualisation","geometry","graphics processing units","integer programming","linear programming","medical image processing","parallel processing","GPU","uncluttered single-image visualization","vascular structures","GPGPU technology","general-purpose graphics processing unit technology","commodity-level parallelism","abdominal aortic vessel tree","anatomical variants","protein structure prediction problem","geometry optimization technique","USIV","2D stylistic image","magnetic resonance angiography","computed tomography","tomographic images","abdominal aorta visualization","structure visualization","3D branching structures direct projection","integer linear programming-based formulation","Visualization","Three dimensional displays","Biomedical imaging","Optimization","Context","Solid modeling","Graphics processing unit","parallelization","Single-image visualization","abdominal aorta","side-chain placement","integer linear programming","GPGPU","CUDA"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Angiography","Aorta, Abdominal","Computer Graphics","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Uncluttered Single-Image Visualization of Vascular Structures Using GPU and Integer Programming","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6143935/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13147843","pubMedId":"22291148","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncluttered Single-Image Visualization of Vascular Structures Using GPU and Integer Programming","sourcePdf":"ttg2013010081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0732S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6363448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6143935","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6143937,"authors":[{"name":"Micah Taylor","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/6297391/6143937/6143937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Micah Taylor received the BS degree in computer science from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2004.

Our formulation computes sound propagation paths from source to receiver and exploits the independence of visibility tests and validation tests to dynamically guide the simulation to high accuracy and performance. Our method makes no assumptions of scene layout and can account for moving sources, receivers, and geometry. We combine our guidance algorithm with a fast GPU sound propagation system for interactive simulation. Our implementation efficiently computes early specular paths and first order diffraction with a multiview tracing algorithm. We couple our propagation simulation with an audio output system supporting a high order interpolation scheme that accounts for attenuation, cross fading, and delay. The resulting system can render acoustic spaces composed of thousands of triangles interactively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer

Based on the log-euclidean Riemannian metric on symmetric positive definite matrices, we propose an incremental log-euclidean Riemannian subspace learning algorithm in which covariance matrices of image features are mapped into a vector space with the log-euclidean Riemannian metric. Based on the subspace learning algorithm, we develop a log-euclidean block-division appearance model which captures both the global and local spatial layout information about object appearances. Single object tracking and multi-object tracking with occlusion reasoning are then achieved by particle filtering-based Bayesian state inference. During tracking, incremental updating of the log-euclidean block-division appearance model captures changes in object appearance. For multi-object tracking, the appearance models of the objects can be updated even in the presence of occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm obtains more accurate results than six state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6332439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6332439/06143947.pdf","endPage":"2440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single and Multiple Object Tracking Using Log-Euclidean Riemannian Subspace and Block-Division Appearance Model","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.42","startPage":"2420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Single and Multiple Object Tracking Using Log-Euclidean Riemannian Subspace and Block-Division Appearance Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143947/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13056962","pubMedId":"22331855","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6143947/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single and Multiple Object Tracking Using Log-Euclidean Riemannian Subspace and Block-Division Appearance Model","sourcePdf":"ttp2012122420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143787S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6332439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6332439","articleId":"6143947","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6143951,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6304885/6143951/6143951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyan Hu received the BS degree in electrical engineering from Hunan University, China, in 2008.

Our work was motivated by the observation that such an evaluation is missing from the rapidly maturing stereo literature and that our findings would be helpful to researchers in binocular and multiview stereo.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6143951/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12998995","pubMedId":"22331856","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Quantitative Evaluation of Confidence Measures for Stereo Vision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quantitative Evaluation of Confidence Measures for Stereo Vision","sourcePdf":"ttp2012112121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121572S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6304885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6304885","articleId":"6143951","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":6143955,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxin Hu","affiliation":["Security Engineering for Future Computing (SEFCOM) Laboratory, Ira A.

However, we still suffer from unintended security leakages by unauthorized actions in business services. Firewalls are the most widely deployed security mechanism to ensure the security of private networks in most businesses and institutions. The effectiveness of security protection provided by a firewall mainly depends on the quality of policy configured in the firewall. Unfortunately, designing and managing firewall policies are often error prone due to the complex nature of firewall configurations as well as the lack of systematic analysis mechanisms and tools. In this paper, we represent an innovative policy anomaly management framework for firewalls, adopting a rule-based segmentation technique to identify policy anomalies and derive effective anomaly resolutions. In particular, we articulate a grid-based representation technique, providing an intuitive cognitive sense about policy anomaly. We also discuss a proof-of-concept implementation of a visualization-based firewall policy analysis tool called Firewall Anomaly Management Environment (FAME). In addition, we demonstrate how efficiently our approach can discover and resolve anomalies in firewall policies through rigorous experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/6167342/06143955.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2012.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2012.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6167342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting and Resolving Firewall Policy Anomalies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Fires","Security","Redundancy","Visualization","IP networks","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","business data processing","cognition","computer network security","data visualisation","grid computing","knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["firewall policy anomaly detection","business services","private network security protection","systematic analysis mechanisms","rule-based segmentation technique","grid based representation technique","intuitive cognitive sense","visualization based firewall policy analysis tool","firewall anomaly management environment","FAME"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Firewall","policy anomaly management","access control","visualization tool."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Detecting and Resolving Firewall Policy Anomalies","volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6143955/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2012","accessionNumber":"12591252","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting and Resolving Firewall Policy Anomalies","sourcePdf":"ttq2012030318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107503S","chronDate":"May-June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"6167342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6167342","articleId":"6143955","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6143975,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Develder","affiliation":["Internet Based Communication Networks and Services (IBCN), Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University IBBT, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6183031/6143975/6143975-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chris Develder (Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. degree in computer science engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, in July 1999 and December 2003, respectively.","From October 1999 to December 2003, he worked in the Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University, as a Researcher for the Research Foundation\u2014Flanders (FWO), on network design and planning. from January 2004 to August 2005, he worked for OPNET Technologies, on transport network design and planning.

They pose novel challenges, calling for efficient interworking of IT resources, for both processing and storage, as well as the network that interconnects them and provides access to their users. We outline those novel applications' requirements, including sheer performance attributes (which will determine the quality as perceived by end users of the cloud applications), as well as the ability to adapt to changing demands (usually referred to as elasticity) and possible failures (i.e., resilience). In outlining the foundational concepts that provide the building blocks for grid/cloud solutions that meet the stringent application requirements we highlight, a prominent role is played by optical networking. The pieces of the solution studied in this respect span the optical transport layer as well as mechanisms located in higher layers (e.g., anycast routing, virtualization) and their interworking (e.g., through appropriate control plane extensions and middleware). Based on this study, we conclude by identifying challenges and research opportunities that can enable future-proof optical cloud systems (e.g., pushing the virtualization paradigms to optical networks).","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143975/","volume":"100","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6143975/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12673618","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical Networks for Grid and Cloud Computing Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Networks for Grid and Cloud Computing Applications","sourcePdf":"jproc-demeester-2179629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201289S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6183031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6183031","articleId":"6143975","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6143977,"authors":[{"name":"Todd Buerkle","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Todd Buerkle received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Montana State University, Bozeman, in 2010.

Modern reconfigurable digital fabrics are enabling new architectures for flight computers, which can exploit environmental awareness to increase their fault tolerance. In this paper, we present the design, modeling, and characterization of a radiation sensor which can be coupled with a reprogrammable hardware fabric to provide spatial information about radiation events that can cause logical faults. The sensor uses a wide area PN junction as its fundamental sensing element. As radiation passes through the sensor, electron hole pairs are created. The internal electric field of the PN junction sweeps the charge carriers in opposite directions which are ultimately sensed by orthogonally placed electrodes on the top and bottom of the sensor. This XY grid provides the spatial location of an ionizing radiation strike, which can be fed to the coupled computer fabric for environmental awareness. A reverse bias voltage is applied to the sensor in order to fully deplete the substrate for maximum charge carrier generation. The sensor is designed to detect the spatial location of radiation strikes of energy levels, which can cause faults in commercial field programmable gate arrays substrates.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6189422/06143977.pdf","startPage":"2229","endPage":"2236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2186288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2186288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6189422","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ionizing Radiation Detector for Environmental Awareness in FPGA-Based Flight Computers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ionization","Radiation","Charge carrier processes","Circuit faults","Extraterrestrial measurements","Conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computers","fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","radiation detection","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ionizing radiation detector","environmental awareness","FPGA-based flight computers","digital electronics","extraterrestrial environments","reprogrammable hardware fabric","logical faults","wide area PN junction","XY grid","spatial location","ionizing radiation strike","reverse bias voltage","maximum charge carrier generation","commercial field programmable gate arrays substrates","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radiation sensors","radiation tolerant computing","silicon radiation detectors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Ionizing Radiation Detector for Environmental Awareness in FPGA-Based Flight Computers","volume":"12","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6143977/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12694689","dateOfInsertion":"26 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ionizing Radiation Detector for Environmental Awareness in FPGA-Based Flight Computers","sourcePdf":"jsen-lameres-2186288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07138S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6189422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6189422","articleId":"6143977","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6143978,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaming Tan","affiliation":["Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Jiaming Tan started with the bachelor program in 2002, specializing in technical physics, at Xidian University.

The significant contribution of this paper is a systematic evaluation of the X-ray radiation effects on image sensors from the individual device level, to the pixel level and to the level of the entire sensor. The major degradation parameters of the sensor have been analyzed. This paper also includes test structures of varying geometries of in-pixel MOSFETs, pinned photodiodes (PPD), and transfer gates (TG). Characterization was performed during different X-ray doses up to 109 krad. The major degradation-an increase in the dark signal-is analyzed by modifying the TG charge transfer time and integration time. The PPD and the TG are the elements most sensitive to the dark signal of the sensor. The radiation-related dimensional effects on the sensors are also evaluated, which show different results compared to 3T pixels. The transfer-gate length influences the dark signal due to not only the electric field variation in the TG channel but also the local defect generations. In-pixel MOSFETs are used to identify the origin of increases in radiation-induced dark signal. Shallow trench isolation (STI) oxides are responsible for the radiation degradation of the sensor. A slight degradation of the quantum efficiency was observed after radiation in the short-wavelength region. Basic hardening-by-design techniques are also presented. The discussion results of the radiation-related dimensional effects on the sensors together with the STI effect can be used as a guideline for future layout designs of radiation-tolerant sensors. Identifying the pixel dark current origin can help to determine where and how to suppress the pixel dark current generation more effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6189422/06143978.pdf","startPage":"2278","endPage":"2286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2186287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2186287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6189422","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing the Radiation Degradation of 4-Transistor Deep Submicron Technology CMOS Image Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Logic gates","Layout","MOSFETs","Leakage current","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","isolation technology","MOSFET","photodiodes","X-ray detection","X-ray effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation degradation analysis","4-transistor deep submicron technology","4T CMOS image sensor","4-transistor complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensor","X-ray radiation-related dimensional effect","systematic evaluation","individual device level","pixel level","sensor degradation parameter","varying geometry structure","in-pixel MOSFET","pinned photodiode","PPD","X-ray dose","transfer gate charge transfer time","TG charge transfer time","TG integration time","transfer-gate length","electric field variation","local defect generation","radiation-induced dark signal","shallow trench isolation oxide","STI oxide","quantum efficiency degradation","short-wavelength region","hardening-by-design technique","radiation-tolerant sensor layout design","pixel dark current identification","pixel dark current generation suppression","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensor","dark signal","dose","hardening-by-design","pinned photodiode","shallow trench isolation","transfer gate","X-ray"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6143978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the Radiation Degradation of 4-Transistor Deep Submicron Technology CMOS Image Sensors","volume":"12","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6143978/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12694690","dateOfInsertion":"26 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the Radiation Degradation of 4-Transistor Deep Submicron Technology CMOS Image Sensors","sourcePdf":"jsen-tan-2186287-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081819S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6189422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6189422","articleId":"6143978","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6143983,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled ElMahgoub","affiliation":["Center of Applied Electromagnetic System Research (CAESR), University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, USA"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"ElMahgoub","id":"37394525900"},{"name":"Atef Z.

Realizing a fan of mutually orthogonal beams for arrays with any N, was shown by us in \"Synthesis of pattern forming networks\" Radio Engineering and Electronic Physics, vol. 27, no. 7, pp. 28-35, 1982. The schemes of the corresponding devices for N = 5, 6 and 8 were also represented, however, the method for building a concrete scheme was described there without details. The present paper is dedicated to the procedure of synthesizing a beam-forming device based on the factorization of its transmission matrix, at this point, each factor represents a matched and decoupling hybrid.

A unified MTF model for a CCD sensor built on an epitaxial layer deposited on a highly doped substrate was developed by Stevens. The Stevens model uses sinusoidal illumination to calculate the sensor MTF degradation due to charge diffusion and sampling aperture as a function of spatial frequency. The drawback of this approach is the difficulty to evaluate analytically the electrical crosstalk distribution, which can be a good tool for predicting the detector performances, particularly for smaller pixels. In this paper, we use point-source illumination to evaluate the pixel response function (PRF). This approach is applied to the case of CMOS sensors and buried channel CCD sensors. The MTF model includes the impact of pixel size and charge diffusion. The QE model and crosstalk distribution are directly derived from the PRF expression. The models can take into account an electric field induced by a doping gradient.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2176493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6155188/06144000.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2176493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical Models of Modulation Transfer Function, Quantum Efficiency, and Crosstalk for CCD and CMOS Image Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144000/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical Models of Modulation Transfer Function, Quantum Efficiency, and Crosstalk for CCD and CMOS Image Sensors","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543203","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144000/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical Models of Modulation Transfer Function, Quantum Efficiency, and Crosstalk for CCD and CMOS Image Sensors","sourcePdf":"ted-djite-2176493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0858S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6155188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6155188","articleId":"6144000","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6144006,"authors":[{"name":"James Theiler","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6243179/6144006/6144006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["James Theiler received the Ph.D. degree in physics from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 1987.","After the Ph.D. degree, he held appointments at UCSD, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Santa Fe Institute.

Indeed, one of the most confounding sources of incidental differences is the inevitable imprecision in the coregistration of the two images.

It amounts to estimating the abundance of pure spectral constituents (endmembers) in each (possibly mixed) observation collected by the imaging instrument. In recent years, several endmember extraction algorithms (EEAs) have been proposed for automated endmember extraction from hyperspectral data sets. Traditionally, EEAs extract/select only one single standard endmember spectrum for each of the presented endmember classes or scene components. The use of fixed endmember spectra, however, is a simplification since in many cases the conditions of the scene components are spatially and temporally variable. As a result, variation in endmember spectral signatures is not always accounted for and, hence, spectral unmixing can lead to poor accuracy of the estimated endmember fractions. Here, we address this issue by developing a simple strategy to adapt available EEAs to select multiple endmembers (or bundles) per scene component. We run the EEAs in randomly selected subsets of the original hyperspectral image, and group the extracted samples of pure materials in a bundle using a clustering technique. The output is a spectral library of pure materials, extracted automatically from the input scene. The proposed technique is applied to several common EEAs and combined with an endmember variability reduction technique for unmixing purposes. Experiments with both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets indicate that the proposed strategy can significantly improve fractional abundance estimations by accounting for endmember variability in the original hyperspectral data.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2181340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6204107/06144017.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2181340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6204107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Extraction of Image-Based Endmember Bundles for Improved Spectral Unmixing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144017/","displayDocTitle":"Automated Extraction of Image-Based Endmember Bundles for Improved Spectral Unmixing","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12746880","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144017/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Extraction of Image-Based Endmember Bundles for Improved Spectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"jstars-somers-2181340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157615S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6204107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6204107","articleId":"6144017","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6144019,"authors":[{"name":"Mou Chen","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407028300"},{"name":"Shuzhi Sam Ge","affiliation":["Robotics Institute and School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering","Social Robotics Lab, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuzhi Sam","lastName":"Ge","id":"37275647400"},{"name":"Bernard Voon Ee How","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Bernard Voon Ee","lastName":"How","id":"37391449800"},{"name":"Yoo Sang Choo","affiliation":["Centre for Offshore Research and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore","Centre for Offshore Research and Engineering"],"firstName":"Yoo Sang","lastName":"Choo","id":"37410403500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6144019","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":166,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1806},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Approximation methods","Robustness","Resource management","Uncertainty","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","Lyapunov methods","marine vehicles","neurocontrollers","observers","position control","robust control","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive position mooring control","marine vessels","thruster assisted mooring system","parametric uncertainties","neural network approximation","backstepping","Lyapunov synthesis","full state feedback","high gain observer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping control","control allocation","mooring systems","nonlinear systems","robust adaptive control"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, robust adaptive control with dynamic control allocation is proposed for the positioning of marine vessels equipped with a thruster assisted mooring system, in the presence of parametric uncertainties, unknown disturbances and input nonlinearities.

A robust adaptive formation controller is developed by employing neural network and dynamic surface control technique. The stability of the design is proven via Lyapunov analysis where semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. The advantages of the proposed formation controller are that: first, the proposed method only uses the measurements of line-of-sight range and angle by local sensors, no other information about the leader is required for control implementation; second, the developed neural formation controller is able to capture the vehicle dynamics without exact information of coriolis and centripetal force, hydrodynamic damping and disturbances from the environment. Comparative analysis with a model-based approach is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6461991/06144020.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2181513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2181513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Dynamic Surface Control for Formations of Autonomous Surface Vehicles With Uncertain Dynamics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Vehicle dynamics","Artificial neural networks","Lead","Vectors","Kinetic theory","Dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","angular measurement","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","Lyapunov methods","marine control","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","robot dynamics","robust control","sensors","stability","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formation control problem","underactuated autonomous surface vehicles","leader-follower formation","ocean disturbances","robust adaptive formation controller","neural network","dynamic surface control technique","design stability","Lyapunov analysis","semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness","closed loop signals","line-of-sight range measurement","angle measurement","local sensors","neural formation controller","vehicle dynamics","adaptive dynamic surface control","uncertain dynamics","ASV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs)","dynamic surface control","formation control","neural networks (NNs)","uncertain dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Dynamic Surface Control for Formations of Autonomous Surface Vehicles With Uncertain Dynamics","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6144020/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13324185","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Dynamic Surface Control for Formations of Autonomous Surface Vehicles With Uncertain Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tcst-peng-2181513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080908S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6461991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"302","xplore-issue":"6461991","articleId":"6144020","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6144021,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6384889/6144021/6144021-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ping Zhou received the B.S. and the M.S. degree in control theory and engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control science.","His research interests include the development of feedback control technologies for optimal process operation, multivariable decoupling control, and soft-sensor technologies with application to industrial process.","Mr. Zhou was the recipient of the Rockwell Automation Award for the Outstanding Application Paper at the Six World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation."]},"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37574152000"},{"name":"Tianyou Chai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6384889/6144021/6144021-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tianyou Chai (M'90\u2013SM'97\u2013F'08) received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1985.","He has been with the Research Center of Automation, Northeastern University, since 1985, where he became a Professor in 1988 and a Chair Professor in 2004.

However, the complex and time-varying nature of the GC process dictates that these GPIs cannot be optimized solely by the lower-level distributed control systems (DCS), therefore an operator is often incorporated to manually determine the set-points for the DCS using his/her operational experience. With a human being involved, the performance and even the safety and stability of the GC operation is subject to human errors. Focusing on this practical challenge, this paper proposes an intelligence-based supervisory control strategy that consists of a control loop set-point optimization module, an artificial neural network-based soft-sensor module, a fuzzy logic-based dynamic adjustor, and an expert-based overload diagnosis and adjustment module to perform the control tasks for the GC system. This hybrid system can automatically adjust the set-points for the DCS-controlled grinding system in response to the changes in boundary conditions or the imminent overload conditions, thereby eliminating the need for an operator. Practical applications have shown the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144021/","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6144021/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13188296","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","displayDocTitle":"Intelligence-Based Supervisory Control for Optimal Operation of a DCS-Controlled Grinding System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligence-Based Supervisory Control for Optimal Operation of a DCS-Controlled Grinding System","sourcePdf":"tcst-zhou-2182996-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072785S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6384889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6384889","articleId":"6144021","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6144023,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Jahn","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6158749/6144023/6144023-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Jahn (S'07) received the Dipl.-Ing.

This auxiliary signal is simply achieved by exploiting the input reflected power of the main device, rather than obtained by conventional methods as driving a highly nonlinear device or subtracting the fundamental power from the output signal. It is demonstrated that substantial IM3 power can be reflected to the source with little reflected fundamental power under some input matching conditions of the device, and this feature can be utilized in the design of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) targeting excellent linearity. A 25-GHz pHEMT power amplifier is designed and fabricated to exemplify the proposed technique. With the linearization, the OIP3 of the proposed PA increases by 14 dB from 25 to 39 dBm, and the output power enhances significantly, from 5 to 14 dBm with -40-dBc IM3 distortion and from 9 to 14 dBm with -40-dBc adjacent channel power ratio.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Logic gates","MMICs","Impedance matching","Mathematical model","PHEMTs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEMT integrated circuits","integrated circuit manufacture","intermodulation","MMIC power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMIC power amplifier linearization","input reflected nonlinearity","auxiliary third-order intermodulation signal","monolithic microwave integrated circuits design","pHEMT power amplifier","OIP3","frequency 25 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intermodulation distortion (IMD)","linearization","monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2180537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6158747/06144027.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6158747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2180537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel MMIC Power Amplifier Linearization Utilizing Input Reflected Nonlinearity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel MMIC Power Amplifier Linearization Utilizing Input Reflected Nonlinearity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144027/","volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144027/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12571116","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel MMIC Power Amplifier Linearization Utilizing Input Reflected Nonlinearity","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wang-2180537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064368S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6158747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6158747","articleId":"6144027","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6144029,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Seifert","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Seifert","id":"37410406500"},{"name":"Herman T. van Dam","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Herman T.","lastName":"van Dam","id":"37321187600"},{"name":"Ruud Vinke","affiliation":["KVI, University of Groningam, Groningen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ruud","lastName":"Vinke","id":"37398255100"},{"name":"Peter Dendooven","affiliation":["KVI, University of Groningam, Groningen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Dendooven","id":"37398254000"},{"name":"Herbert Lohner","affiliation":["KVI, University of Groningam, Groningen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Lohner","id":"37332986800"},{"name":"Freek J.

However, the theory about the timing resolution of SiPM-based detectors is not yet fully understood. Here we propose a comprehensive statistical model to predict the timing resolution of SiPM-based scintillation detectors. It incorporates the relevant SiPM-related parameters (viz. the single cell electronic response, the single cell gain, the charge carrier transit time spread, and crosstalk) as well as the scintillation pulse rise and decay times, light yield, and energy resolution. It is shown that the proposed model reduces to the well-established Hyman model for timing with PMTs if the number of primary triggers (photoelectrons in case of a PMT) is Poisson distributed and crosstalk and electronic noise are negligible. The model predictions are validated by measurements of the coincidence resolving times (CRT) for 511 keV photons of two identical detectors as a function of SiPM bias voltage, for two different kinds of scintillators, namely LYSO:Ce and LaBr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n:5%Ce.

Since most DG units use a converter as an interface with the grid, new control strategies for these converters are being developed. For the islanded mode of the microgrid, with the voltage-based droop control strategy, active and reactive power balancing and sharing between multiple DG units are achieved. This method also makes it easy to delay changing the output power of the renewable DG units compared to that of the dispatchable DG units without communication. However, to deal with harmonic and nonlinear loads, the power control strategies in general, with the voltage-based control strategy as a specific example, need to be modified. Otherwise, the grid-forming DG units form short circuits for harmonic currents. Therefore, in this paper, the shunt harmonic impedance method for harmonic damping in the grid-connected mode is adapted for application in islanded microgrids. The voltage-based droop control strategy of the DG units is extended with programmable resistive behavior toward harmonics. In this way, harmonic current sharing between DG units can be achieved in a controllable manner (e.g., according to the ratings of the units).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2176756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6172598","startPage":"831","endPage":"841","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6172598/06144036.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controllable Harmonic Current Sharing in Islanded Microgrids: DG Units With Programmable Resistive Behavior Toward Harmonics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6144036/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Controllable Harmonic Current Sharing in Islanded Microgrids: DG Units With Programmable Resistive Behavior Toward Harmonics","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12637888","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controllable Harmonic Current Sharing in Islanded Microgrids: DG Units With Programmable Resistive Behavior Toward Harmonics","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-vandoorn-2176756-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115761S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6172598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6172598","articleId":"6144036","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6144047,"authors":[{"name":"Josep Miquel Jornet","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6195043/6144047/6144047-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Josep Miquel Jornet (S\u201908) received the Engineering degree in telecommunication engineering in 2008 and the Master of Science degree in information and communication technologies from the School of Electrical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.

WNSNs are the enabling technology for unique applications such as intrabody drug delivery systems or surveillance networks for chemical attack prevention. One of the major bottlenecks in WNSNs is posed by the very limited energy that can be stored in a nanosensor mote in contrast to the energy that is required by the device to communicate. Recently, novel energy harvesting mechanisms have been proposed to replenish the energy stored in nanodevices. With these mechanisms, WNSNs can overcome their energy bottleneck and even have infinite lifetime (perpetual WNSNs), provided that the energy harvesting and consumption processes are jointly designed. In this paper, an energy model for self-powered nanosensor motes is developed, which successfully captures the correlation between the energy harvesting and the energy consumption processes. The energy harvesting process is realized by means of a piezoelectric nanogenerator, for which a new circuital model is developed that can accurately reproduce existing experimental data. The energy consumption process is due to the communication among nanosensor motes in the terahertz band (0.1-10 THz). The proposed energy model captures the dynamic network behavior by means of a probabilistic analysis of the total network traffic and the multiuser interference. A mathematical framework is developed to obtain the probability distribution of the nanosensor mote energy and to investigate the end-to-end successful packet delivery probability, the end-to-end packet delay, and the achievable throughput of WNSNs. Nanosensor motes have not been built yet and, thus, the development of an analytical energy model is a fundamental step toward the design of WNSNs architectures and protocols.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2012.2186313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6195043/06144047.pdf","startPage":"570","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6195043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2012.2186313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Energy Harvesting and Communication Analysis for Perpetual Wireless Nanosensor Networks in the Terahertz Band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint Energy Harvesting and Communication Analysis for Perpetual Wireless Nanosensor Networks in the Terahertz Band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144047/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12711828","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144047/","volume":"11","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Energy Harvesting and Communication Analysis for Perpetual Wireless Nanosensor Networks in the Terahertz Band","sourcePdf":"tnano-jornet-2186313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175843S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6195043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6195043","articleId":"6144047","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6144052,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Lun Hung","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Penghu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/6213178/6144052/6144052-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Lun Hung was born in Penghu, Taiwan, in 1970.

Its operation at a high harmonic number is of practical importance because the required magnetic field strength can be reduced by a factor of the harmonic number. Although hollow circular waveguides have typically been used as the interaction structure in harmonic gyro-TWTs, spurious oscillations limit their performance. This study investigates the possibility of using coaxial waveguides as the interaction structure in a second-harmonic gyro-TWT. Stability is achieved by applying distributed losses on the outer and inner walls. Simulation results indicate that the distributed losses on the inner wall can suppress specific oscillating modes without deteriorating the performance of the amplifying mode. Under stable operating conditions, simulations indicate that the second-harmonic coaxial gyro-TWT generates a peak power of 293 kW in the Ka-band with 21% efficiency, a saturated gain of 42 dB, and a bandwidth of 1.31 GHz (\u2248 4.1%) for a 70-kV 20-A electron beam with an \u03b1 = 1.0 and an axial velocity spread of 5%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6213178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2012.2184305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/6213178/06144052.pdf","startPage":"1545","endPage":"1550","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2012.2184305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable High-Power Second-Harmonic Coaxial-Waveguide Gyrotron Traveling-Wave-Tube Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Stable High-Power Second-Harmonic Coaxial-Waveguide Gyrotron Traveling-Wave-Tube Amplifier","volume":"40","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6144052/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12773128","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable High-Power Second-Harmonic Coaxial-Waveguide Gyrotron Traveling-Wave-Tube Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tps-hung-2184305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057097S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"6213178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6213178","articleId":"6144052","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6144060,"authors":[{"name":"Linh K.

However, these techniques often require excessive computational power and memory that are compounded with a large number of volumetric inputs. Restricted access to supercomputing power limits its influence in general research and practical applications. In this paper we introduce ISP, an Image-Set Processing streaming framework that harnesses the processing power of commodity heterogeneous CPU/GPU systems and attempts to solve this computational problem. In ISP, we introduce specially designed streaming algorithms and data structures that provide an optimal solution for out-of-core multiimage processing problems both in terms of memory usage and computational efficiency. ISP makes use of the asynchronous execution mechanism supported by parallel heterogeneous systems to efficiently hide the inherent latency of the processing pipeline of out-of-core approaches. Consequently, with computationally intensive problems, the ISP out-of-core solution can achieve the same performance as the in-core solution. We demonstrate the efficiency of the ISP framework on synthetic and real datasets.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6180049/06144060.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISP: An Optimal Out-of-Core Image-Set Processing Streaming Architecture for Parallel Heterogeneous Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6180049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.32","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"ISP: An Optimal Out-of-Core Image-Set Processing Streaming Architecture for Parallel Heterogeneous Systems","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12656110","pubMedId":"22291156","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6144060/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISP: An Optimal Out-of-Core Image-Set Processing Streaming Architecture for Parallel Heterogeneous Systems","sourcePdf":"ttg2012060838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082017S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6180049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6180049","articleId":"6144060","onlineDate":"31 January 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144064,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Omid Shahdi","affiliation":["Computer Vision, Video and Image Processing (CvviP) Research Lab,  Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Seyed Omid","lastName":"Shahdi","id":"38292035700"},{"name":"S.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to explicitly tackle this problem. Multi-color uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) is introduced for extracting salient features along with wavelet transform. Learning scheme is adopted to obtain a mapping coefficient vector between face in a pose and frontal face. Then expected frontal face view vector could be generated by inserting the posed face. Instead of using the entire face, some of its important regions are taken into account. The proposed method relies only on single frontal face image as a gallery image. Results have demonstrated that the proposed method operates well even under the low-resolution conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144064","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138563/6144061/06144064.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144061","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-color ULBP with wavelet transform in invariant pose face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-color ULBP with wavelet transform in invariant pose face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144064/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526900","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6144064/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-color ULBP with wavelet transform in invariant pose face recognition","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569455149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088684S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138563","isNumber":"6144061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6144061","articleId":"6144064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6144113,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Akbarpour Sekeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Systems, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Akbarpour","lastName":"Sekeh","id":"37946348200"},{"name":"Mohd.

In Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the PAPR is around 12-13 dB. Also in the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), the PAPR is appeared. By combining these two systems (CDMA and OFDM), a good system can be produced which it supports high capacity (multi user multiplexing) with high bit rate. Still the PAPR appeared in the new system because it is a multicarrier system as well. In this work we proposed a novel algorithm to enhance the PAPR which is called 'Half Length Phase Updating' (HLPU), it is called half because the phase updating will be applied to only half of the IFFT length (N/2). The HLPU will be predefined both in the transmitter and the receiver, so that, no need to send even one bit of side information from the transmitter to the receiver. This additional block in the system will be inserted before the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) of the Multicarrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) system. The simulation results proved that there is 94.2% reduction in the system complexity and a reduction in the PAPR of around 2 dB has been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144116","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138563/6144061/06144116.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144061","startPage":"324","endPage":"326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel simple algorithm to enhance the peak to average ratio of MC-CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel simple algorithm to enhance the peak to average ratio of MC-CDMA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144116/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526952","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6144116/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel simple algorithm to enhance the peak to average ratio of MC-CDMA system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569471565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048624S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138563","isNumber":"6144061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6144061","articleId":"6144116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144128,"authors":[{"name":"John See","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Persiaran Multimedia, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"See","id":"37413904400"},{"name":"Mohammad Faizal Ahmad Fauzi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Persiaran Multimedia, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Faizal Ahmad","lastName":"Fauzi","id":"37542034300"},{"name":"Chikkannan Eswaran","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Persiaran Multimedia, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chikkannan","lastName":"Eswaran","id":"37274590000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0242-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0243-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0241-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6144128","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Video sequences","Bayesian methods","Face recognition","Training","Hidden Markov models","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","face recognition","image sequences","pattern classification","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video-based face recognition","exemplar-driven Bayesian network classifier","exemplars extraction","video sequences"]}],"abstract":"Many recent works in video-based face recognition involved the extraction of exemplars to summarize face appearances in video sequences. However, there has been a lack of attention towards modeling the causal relationship between classes and their associated exemplars. In this paper, we propose a novel Exemplar-Driven Bayesian Network (EDBN) classifier for face recognition in video. Our Bayesian framework addresses the drawbacks of typical exemplar-based approaches by incorporating temporal continuity between consecutive video frames while encoding the causal relationship between extracted exemplars and their parent classes within the framework. Under the EDBN framework, we describe a non-parametric approach of estimating probability densities using similarity scores that are computationally quick. Comprehensive experiments on two standard face video datasets demonstrated good recognition rates achieved by our method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144128","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138563/6144061/06144128.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144061","startPage":"372","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video-based face recognition using Exemplar-Driven Bayesian Network classifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Video-based face recognition using Exemplar-Driven Bayesian Network classifier","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144128/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526964","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video-based face recognition using Exemplar-Driven Bayesian Network classifier","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569474095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044374S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","isNumber":"6144061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138563","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6144128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6144141,"authors":[{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl F.

The long ranges and operational scenarios involved mean that only single-ping operations are considered. The waveforms under consideration are long-duration Cox combs and sinusoidally frequency modulated (SFM) pulses, arbitrarily selected to occupy the frequency range 1 to 2 kHz. When used in conjunction with a matched filter, these waveforms offer an attractive Doppler resolution, but suffer from significant range sidelobes. The proposed mismatched filters attempt to improve their range resolution or lower their sidelobes across the zero-Doppler region of the range-Doppler domain. The designed cross-ambiguity functions achieve range sidelobes lower than -32.5 dB for the Cox comb, and -33.0 dB for the SFM pulse, as well as acceptable Doppler sidelobes at non-zero delays. This comes at a price of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss of 18.5 dB for the Cox comb, and 20.5 dB for the SFM pulse.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Frequency modulation","Doppler effect","Signal to noise ratio","Correlation","Wideband","Reverberation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","filtering theory","radar resolution","sonar","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatched filters","Doppler-sensitive active sonar pulses","radar poly-phase codes","long-range active sonar systems","transmit waveforms","single-ping operations","long-duration Cox combs","sinusoidally frequency modulated pulses","SFM pulses","attractive Doppler resolution","range sidelobes","range resolution","zero-Doppler region","range-Doppler domain","cross-ambiguity functions","acceptable Doppler sidelobes","non-zero delays","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR loss"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144141","startPage":"150","endPage":"155","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138563/6144061/06144141.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mismatched filters for Doppler-sensitive active sonar pulses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mismatched filters for Doppler-sensitive active sonar pulses","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12526977","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6144141/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mismatched filters for Doppler-sensitive active sonar pulses","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569474549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066463S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138563","isNumber":"6144061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6144061","articleId":"6144141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6144144,"authors":[{"name":"Sepideh Araban","affiliation":["Member of Scientific Association of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sepideh","lastName":"Araban","id":"38238550800"},{"name":"Fardad Farokhi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fardad","lastName":"Farokhi","id":"37596620500"},{"name":"Kave Kangarloo","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Kave","lastName":"Kangarloo","id":"37706076800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0242-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0243-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0241-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6144144","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Skin","Artificial neural networks","Clustering algorithms","Lighting","Training","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image colour analysis","multilayer perceptrons","object detection","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skin detection","clustered neural network","colour component","object detection","object recognition problem","multilayer perceptron neural network","Utans algorithm","feature selection method","color space"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144144","abstract":"Object detection problems-skin detection here can be considered as object recognition problems with two classes.

Suitable waveforms to achieve high resolution SAR imaging are proposed for both friendly and hostile environments. The proposed waveforms were tested for full two dimensional SAR image construction. The huge computation task of SAR imaging concentrates on range and azimuth compression which in turns heavily depends on computing FFT/IFFT and complex multiplications as part of the RDA algorithm.

It suffers, however, from an inherent (intrinsic) imaginary inter-carrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal processing tasks such as channel estimation (CE). Recently, the so-called interference approximation method (IAM) was proposed for preamble-based CE in single-input single-output (SISO) systems. It relies on the knowledge of the pilot's neighborhood to approximate this interference and constructively exploit it in simplifying CE and improving its performance. A number of IAM preambles have been proposed, with varying CE performance. This paper is concerned with the application of the IAM idea in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The most prominent IAM variants are considered and their MIMO extensions with their relative advantages and practical issues are investigated. The IAM preambles are compared, with each other and with CP-OFDM, via simulations in both mildly and highly frequency-selective channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preamble-based channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM/OQAM systems","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144161","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138563/6144061/06144161.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2011.6144161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Preamble-based channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM/OQAM systems","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144161/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526997","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preamble-based channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM/OQAM systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569475285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050991S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138563","isNumber":"6144061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138563","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6144061","articleId":"6144161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144164,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Nagi","affiliation":["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA), Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA), University of Lugano, Manno Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Nagi","id":"37697698800"},{"name":"Frederick Ducatelle","affiliation":["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA), Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA), University of Lugano, Manno Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Frederick","lastName":"Ducatelle","id":"37270037700"},{"name":"Gianni A.

The power loading algorithms however do not distinguish between data and pilot symbols. A similar situation exists for optimal pilot patterns where pilots are placed in the optimal positions to achieve the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) but no consideration is given to power loading schemes. This paper investigates this scenario and proposes an optimal solution based on the Least Squares (LS) estimator which could be applied to future CR algorithm implementations as well as a possible standardization aspect to ensure an optimal solution to a crucial problem in practical implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ITU Kaleidoscope 2011: The Fully Networked Human? - Innovations for Future Networks and Services (K-2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138392/6144197/06144224.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144197","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ITU Kaleidoscope 2011: The Fully Networked Human? - Innovations for Future Networks and Services (K-2011)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal pilot patterns considering optimal power loading for Cognitive Radios in the two dimensional scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal pilot patterns considering optimal power loading for Cognitive Radios in the two dimensional scenario","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144224/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144224/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526770","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal pilot patterns considering optimal power loading for Cognitive Radios in the two dimensional scenario","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"S42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050988S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138392","isNumber":"6144197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138392","xplore-issue":"6144197","articleId":"6144224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ITU","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144225,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Pirmoradian","affiliation":["WMN (Wireless Multimedia & Networking) Research Group, Kingston University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Pirmoradian","id":"37593457500"},{"name":"Christos Politis","affiliation":["WMN (Wireless Multimedia & Networking) Research Group, Kingston University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Politis","id":"37267957700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-92-61-13651-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1935-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6144225","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Time frequency analysis","Interference","Quality of service","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal spectrum hole selection","cognitive radio networks","smart cities","wireless communication channels","spectrum scarcity","radio spectrum band allocation","CR technology","static spectrum band assignment","spectrum opportunity selection scheme","minimum collision technique","MCT scheme","maximum residual lifetime technique","MRLT scheme","channel utilization","channel collision","secondary-transmission bytes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Utilization","Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Holes"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal spectrum hole selection & exploitation in cognitive radio networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144197","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ITU Kaleidoscope 2011: The Fully Networked Human? - Innovations for Future Networks and Services (K-2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ITU Kaleidoscope 2011: The Fully Networked Human? - Innovations for Future Networks and Services (K-2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138392/6144197/06144225.pdf","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144225","abstract":"Future networks, especially in the framework of smart cities will be populated with various kinds of equipment accessing wireless communication channels. A much higher device variety will increase spectrum scarcity. Cognitive radio networks will be a key enabling technology in order to cope with the availability of the allocated radio spectrum bands. Cognitive Radio (CR) technology significantly utilizes current static spectrum bands assignment in an opportunistic manner. In this paper, we propose two spectrum opportunity (or spectrum hole) selection schemes; Minimum Collision Technique (MCT) and Maximum Residual Lifetime Technique (MRLT). The proposed techniques are evaluated by average channel utilization, average channel collision and successful secondary transmission bytes over licensed channels in a specific period of time (100s). The numerical results confirm that the MRLT scheme provides higher channel utilization and transmission bytes as well as decreases channel collision compared with the MCT scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12526771","htmlLink":"/document/6144225/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal spectrum hole selection & exploitation in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal spectrum hole selection & exploitation in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"S43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050102S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138392","isNumber":"6144197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138392","xplore-issue":"6144197","articleId":"6144225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ITU","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6144226,"authors":[{"name":"Chedlia Ben Naila","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Chedlia","lastName":"Ben Naila","id":"37393104400"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Wakamori","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Wakamori","id":"38497658700"},{"name":"Mitsuji Matsumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuji","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37270406200"},{"name":"Katsutoshi Tsukamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsutoshi","lastName":"Tsukamoto","id":"37289602800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-92-61-13651-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1935-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6144226","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Communication standards","Data communication","Adaptive optics","Optical fiber communication","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical links","radio-over-fibre","telecommunication services","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission analysis","digital TV signals","RoFSO channel","radiofrequency on free-space optical channel","FSO communication networks","broadband connectivity","integrated services digital broadcasting-terrestrial signals","ISDB-T signals","FSO link","radio over fiber technology","RoF technology","wireless services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio-on-Free space optics (RoFSO)","broadband wireless access","Digital TV","atmospheric turbulence"]}],"abstract":"Recently, Radio frequency on free-space optical (RoFSO) technology is regarded as a new universal platform for enabling seamless convergence of fiber and FSO communication networks, thus extending broadband connectivity to underserved areas.

Because completely error-free computing in this structure was not achieved, strategies to eliminate errors are proposed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144287","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125891/6144287/06144445.pdf","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2011.6144445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2011.6144445","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a nanomagnetic full adder circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144445/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a nanomagnetic full adder circuit","htmlLink":"/document/6144445/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12538914","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a nanomagnetic full adder circuit","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"0215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054709S","chronDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6125891","isNumber":"6144287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6125891","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6144287","articleId":"6144445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144465,"authors":[{"name":"Xueming Ju","affiliation":["Institute for Nanoelectronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Xueming","lastName":"Ju","id":"37391515700"},{"name":"Markus Becherer","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Becherer","id":"37394350500"},{"name":"Josef Kiermaier","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Kiermaier","id":"37601335300"},{"name":"Stephan Breitkreutz","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Breitkreutz","id":"37601334800"},{"name":"Paolo Lugli","affiliation":["Institute for Nanoelectronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Lugli","id":"37274485500"},{"name":"Gy\u00f6rgy Csaba","affiliation":["Center for Nano Science and Technology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Gy\u00f6rgy","lastName":"Csaba","id":"38297941900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1516-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1514-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1515-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"6144465","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Nonhomogeneous media","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Demagnetization","Films","Magnetic multilayers","Radiation effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits","nanoelectronics","nanomagnetics","Permalloy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error analysis","Co/Pt multilayer based nanomagnetic logic","nanoscale computing paradigm","field-coupled single-domain nanomagnets","permalloy","NML devices","magnetic ordering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nanomagnetic Logic","Co/Pt multilayer","error analysis","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy"]}],"abstract":"Nanomagnetic Logic (NML) is a novel nanoscale computing paradigm based on field-coupled single-domain nanomagnets. Most of the studies so far have been focused on permalloy, where the easy axis of magnetization is in-plane. Co/Pt multilayer films, which exhibit large perpendicular anisotropy, were recently proposed as promising media for implementing NML. The operation of NML devices is based on magnetic ordering. Frustrations of ordering will result in computing errors. In this paper, we explore the sources of errors in Co/Pt multilayer based NML observed in our experimental and simulation studies.

This is unlike proposals for using nano-magnets to represent binary states. A collection of nano-magnets, when driven to their ground states, can be seen to optimize a quadratic energy function that is determined by their relative placement. By controlling the relative placement of nano-magnets, we can change the energy function being minimized. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this capability by fabricating and testing an example of a quadratic optimization problem that accomplishes line grouping.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2011.6144474","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125891/6144287/06144474.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2011.6144474","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental demonstration of the viability of energy minimizing computing using nano-magnets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An experimental demonstration of the viability of energy minimizing computing using nano-magnets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144474/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144474/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538943","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","conferenceDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental demonstration of the viability of energy minimizing computing using nano-magnets","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"0251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099936S","chronDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6125891","isNumber":"6144287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6125891","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6144287","articleId":"6144474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144484,"authors":[{"name":"Sami Smaili","affiliation":["Electrical and Engineering Department, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Smaili","id":"37589470400"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Electrical and Engineering Department, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1516-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1514-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1515-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"6144484","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"abstract":"This article has been retracted by the publisher.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2011.6144484","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125891/6144287/06144484.pdf","startPage":"1557","endPage":"1562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2011.6144484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Dipole and quadrupole resonance modes of symmetric nanoegg dimers in the quasistatic regime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Dipole and quadrupole resonance modes of symmetric nanoegg dimers in the quasistatic regime","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: This document was removed from IEEE Xplore in accordance with IEEE policy.

Two different types of dots for signal propagation in a wire and logic operations in a majority gate are introduced. The switching behavior and the interaction of fabricated nanomagnets is analyzed by MOKE measurements. Partial irradiation with a focused ion beam (FIB) is used to influence the switching and the interaction of the utilized nanomagnets. Experimental results are used to calibrate the nanomagnetic compact models. Investigations on nanomagnetic wires and an XOR gate are performed. Simulations show that the error rate mainly depends on the switching field variations from dot to dot and the strength of the coupling field between the dots. High coupling fields by small gaps between the nanomagnets and accurate control of switching field variations by partial FIB irradiation turn out to be the key for realizing reliable NML systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanomagnetic logic: Investigations on field-coupled computing devices by experiment-based compact modeling","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2011.6144542","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125891/6144287/06144542.pdf","startPage":"1248","endPage":"1251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2011.6144542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Nanomagnetic logic: Investigations on field-coupled computing devices by experiment-based compact modeling","conferenceDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144542/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanomagnetic logic: Investigations on field-coupled computing devices by experiment-based compact modeling","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"0347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045378S","chronDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6125891","isNumber":"6144287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6125891","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6144287","articleId":"6144542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144546,"authors":[{"name":"Yalcin Yilmaz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yalcin","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"38071275400"},{"name":"Pinaki Mazumder","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Pinaki","lastName":"Mazumder","id":"37278367400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1516-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1514-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1515-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"6144546","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Magnetization","Wires","Switches","Stress","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits","nanomagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanopipelining","NML","multiferroic single-domain nanomagnet","nanomagnetic logic application","ultra-low energy consumption","pipelined signal propagation","phase local clocking scheme"]}],"abstract":"A recent technology, multiferroic single-domain nanomagnets are very promising for energy efficient nanomagnetic logic (NML) applications with benefits of ultra-low energy consumption and inherent non-volatility.

The advantage of AFM is that it can get extraordinary high resolution image at atom level. However, AFM obtains the sample topography image through scanning on the top of sample line by line, therefore it takes couples minutes to get an image and this negative point makes it difficult to continuously observe surface change during manipulation. In this paper, a novel approach for compressive sensing based video rate AFM imaging system is proposed. In this method, compressive sensing is used for sampling topography information of sample surface efficiently. Compressive sensing could use fewer measurements for data sensing to recovery the image through image reconstruction algorithm. This technique decreases the scanning time for AFM scanner because of fewer measurements needed. The video rate for this new approach could reach as high as 1.75 seconds per frame.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video rate Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging using compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2011.6144587","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125891/6144287/06144587.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2011.6144587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Video rate Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging using compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144587/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539051","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video rate Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging using compressive sensing","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"0412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111849S","chronDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6125891","isNumber":"6144287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6125891","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6144287","articleId":"6144587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6144602,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, the suitability of different classes of magnetic materials constituting the STT-RAM free layer is reviewed for faster switching and thermal stability. We identify the following material classes for faster switching in the thermally stable free-layer of a STT-RAM: (a) In-plane materials with high H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</sub>\n and low M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</sub>\n.

However, high H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</sub>\n materials benefit from higher thermal stability. (b) Perpendicular materials with low damping have the same switching speed as in-plane materials but greater switching probability because of a lower critical current. The demagnetization field helps the free layer to start switching to the hard axis, but hinders it from switching further to the easy axis beyond the equator. (c) Anti-ferromagnetically capped partially-perpendicular materials. Capping with a Va layer decreases the demagnetization field, which promotes faster switching.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2011.6144606","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125891/6144287/06144606.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2011.6144606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144287","startPage":"1403","endPage":"1408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative material issues for fast reliable switching in STT-RAMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparative material issues for fast reliable switching in STT-RAMs","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144606/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539067","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6144606/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative material issues for fast reliable switching in STT-RAMs","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"0436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066695S","chronDate":"15-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6125891","isNumber":"6144287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6125891","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6144287","articleId":"6144606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6144621,"authors":[{"name":"Sami Smaili","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Smaili","id":"37589470400"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1516-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1514-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1515-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"6144621","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144621","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Integrated circuit modeling","Analytical models","Inductance","Computational modeling","Nanoparticles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanoparticles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["core displacement effect","high order resonance modes","quasistatic regime"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study the high order resonance modes in a nanoegg and how the core displacement affects the properties of such modes.

We have designed two complementary evolutionary frameworks for the automated discovery of circuits. The memristor-based circuits are evaluated using ngspice. Our best circuit only uses three memristors for a fully functional associative memory of two inputs. HP has demonstrated practical memristors working at 3nm \u00d7 3nm sizes in terms of area.

The accelerometer frequency range is from 0.003 to 200 Hz at the \u00b13 dB level. The noise floor (equivalent input noise acceleration) is about 600, 55, 37, 7 and 3 nG/\u221a(Hz) at frequencies 0.1, 0.5, 1, 10 and 100 Hz, respectively. The sensor incorporates the ultra-low-noise FET-input charge amplifier and the PE transducer operated in the flexural, circular bender bimorph mode. Key factors for low-noise operation are discussed. The contribution of the PE transducer noise and charge amplifier noise is shown at a frequency range from 0.1 to 200 Hz. In addition to ultra-low-noise and near-dc frequency response, the designed accelerometer has other parameters impressive for the seismic IEPE sensors: output impedance \u2264 10 \u03a9, 100\u00b0C maximum operating temperature and 250 G pk shock limit. The sensor's noise floor was measured directly at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The experimental results have good correlation with the noise values evaluated based on the measured charge amplifier noise and the theoretical PE transducer thermal noise. The ultra-low-noise floor of the designed sensor allowed using it in the stabilization platform, which carries the world's most frequency stable laser system used for the atomic clock research conducted by NIST.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2186564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2186564","startPage":"2262","endPage":"2268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6189422/06144688.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6189422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Low-Noise Seismic Piezoelectric Accelerometer With Integral FET Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Low-Noise Seismic Piezoelectric Accelerometer With Integral FET Amplifier","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 April 2012","volume":"12","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144688/","accessionNumber":"12694693","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144688/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Low-Noise Seismic Piezoelectric Accelerometer With Integral FET Amplifier","sourcePdf":"jsen-levinzon-2186564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056338S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6189422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6189422","articleId":"6144688","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6144690,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Wei Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407026300"},{"name":"Jose Ramon Duran Retamal","affiliation":["Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jose Ramon Duran","lastName":"Retamal","id":"38242472200"},{"name":"Cheng-Ying Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406725100"},{"name":"Jr-Hau He","affiliation":["Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jr-Hau","lastName":"He","id":"37404357600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6144690","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":902},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"The surface effect on the photocarrier relaxation behavior using a single ZnO nanowire (NW) ultraviolet (UV) photodetector has been evaluated.

Since the Lyapunov functions and their derivatives are quadratic forms, the operation with them is as simple as for linear time invariant systems.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2012.2186179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6174496/06144710.pdf","startPage":"1035","endPage":"1040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6174496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2012.2186179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strict Lyapunov Functions for the Super-Twisting Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Strict Lyapunov Functions for the Super-Twisting Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144710/","publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12639029","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144710/","volume":"57","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strict Lyapunov Functions for the Super-Twisting Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tac-moreno-2186179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068992S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6174496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"675","xplore-issue":"6174496","articleId":"6144710","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6144714,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-yeon Kim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media Communication (INMC), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6178353/6144714/6144714-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-Yeon Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics, telecommunications and computer engineering from Korea Aerospace University, Goyang, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

The proposed 16 \u00d7 8 planar slot array antenna consisted of arrays with alternating reactance slot pairs that could achieve impedance matching and uniform field ex- citation, simultaneously. Furthermore, the grating lobes were effectively suppressed with the help of these radiating units due to the one-half guided wavelength slot spacing. An equivalent circuit analysis was done to evaluate the input impedances of the radiating and feeding lines with the impedance recursive formulas as well as the mode voltages of the radiating slot elements. In addition, a wideband transition with a 30.13% bandwidth under the criteria of less than VSWR 1.5:1 was presented to provide the necessary power with the minimal reflection and to prevent the distortion of the radiation patterns. The proposed planar slot array antenna occupied an aperture area of 57.4\u00d7 51.6 mm. The measured bandwidth, gain, and efficiency were 990 MHz (2.88%), 24.3 dBi, and 53.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the side lobe levels (SLLs) were verified for each cutting plane with -13.57 dB and -13.17 dB, respectively. The proposed antenna structure was achieved with a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) with the low costs and lightweight features.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2186270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178353","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1795","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6178353/06144714.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Series Slot Array Antenna for 45--Inclined Linear Polarization With SIW Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6144714/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Series Slot Array Antenna for 45<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{\\circ}$</tex></formula>-Inclined Linear Polarization With SIW Technology","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639426","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Series Slot Array Antenna for 45<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{\\circ}$</tex></formula>-Inclined Linear Polarization With SIW Technology","sourcePdf":"tap-kim-2186270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09348S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6178353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6178353","articleId":"6144714","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6144715,"authors":[{"name":"Jungyub Lee","affiliation":["SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS Co., LTD, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jungyub","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086637449"},{"name":"Jeongkyu Heo","affiliation":["SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS Co., LTD, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongkyu","lastName":"Heo","id":"37086634003"},{"name":"Joonghee Lee","affiliation":["SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS Co., LTD, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Joonghee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086637448"},{"name":"Youngho Han","affiliation":["Dept. of Advanced Material Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngho","lastName":"Han","id":"37311133800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6144715","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1338},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This communication presents practical implementations of small antennas using magneto-dielectric (MD) materials.

The liquid nature of the moving parts of the antenna helps avoid the main disadvantage of mechanically-actuated reconfigurable antennas which is the mechanical failure of their solid parts due to material fatigue, creep or wear. Furthermore, the displacement of liquid elements can be more effectively performed than in the case of solid materials by applying precise microfluidic techniques such as continuous-flow pumping or electrowetting. The reconfiguration mechanism is demonstrated through the design, fabrication and measurement of a radiation pattern reconfigurable antenna. This antenna operates at 1800 MHz with 4.0% bandwidth and is capable of performing beam-steering over a 360\u00b0 range with fine tuning. The antenna is a novel circular Yagi-Uda array, where the movable parasitic director and reflector elements are implemented by liquid metal mercury (Hg). The parasitics are placed and rotated in a circular microfluidic channel around the driven element by means of a flow generated and controlled by a piezoelectric micropump.

When a sound is detected, acoustic-FADE locates the source, enhances the signal, and classifies it as \u201cfall\u201d or \u201cnonfall.\u201d The sound source is located using the steered response power with phase transform technique, which has been shown to be robust under noisy environments and resilient to reverberation effects. Signal enhancement is performed by the beamforming technique based on the estimated sound source location. Height information is used to increase the specificity. The mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features computed from the enhanced signal are utilized in the classification process. We have evaluated the performance of acoustic-FADE using simulated fall and nonfall sounds performed by three stunt actors trained to behave like elderly under different environmental conditions. Using a dataset consisting of 120 falls and 120 nonfalls, the acoustic-FADE achieves 100% sensitivity at a specificity of 97%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6185708/06144718.pdf","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2186449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2186449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Microphone Array System for Automatic Fall Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Arrays","Array signal processing","Delay","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","medical signal processing","microphone arrays","patient monitoring","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphone array system","automatic fall detection","medical intervention delay reduction","acoustic fall detection system","acoustic-FADE","caregiver","circular microphone array","sound source localisation","steered response power","phase transform technique","signal enhancement","beamforming technique","height information","mel frequency cepstral coefficient features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming (BF) and height information","fall detection","microphone arrays","sound source localization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Accidental Falls","Acoustics","Adult","Algorithms","Female","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Sound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Microphone Array System for Automatic Fall Detection","volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6144718/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12674623","pubMedId":"22532430","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Microphone Array System for Automatic Fall Detection","sourcePdf":"tbme-ho-2186449-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079099S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6185708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6185708","articleId":"6144718","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6144725,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6243179/6144725/6144725-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Zhang was born in Zhejiang Province, China, 1984.

Owing to its size and weight constraints, UAV is very sensitive to atmospheric turbulence that causes serious trajectory deviations. In this paper, a novel databased motion compensation (MOCO) approach is proposed for the UAV SAR imagery. The approach is implemented by a three-step process: 1) The range-invariant motion error is estimated by the weighted phase gradient autofocus (WPGA), and the nonsystematic range cell migration function is calculated from the estimate for each subaperture SAR data; 2) the retrieval of the range-dependent phase error is executed by a local maximum-likelihood WPGA algorithm; and 3) the subaperture phase errors are coherently combined to perform the MOCO for the full-aperture data. Both simulated and real-data experiments show that the proposed approach is appropriate for highly precise imaging for UAV SAR equipped with only low-accuracy inertial navigation system.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2180392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6243179/06144725.pdf","startPage":"3202","endPage":"3218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2180392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6243179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Motion Compensation Approach for UAV SAR Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144725/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Motion Compensation Approach for UAV SAR Imagery","volume":"50","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12866545","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144725/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Motion Compensation Approach for UAV SAR Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2180392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182322S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6243179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6243179","articleId":"6144725","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":6144727,"authors":[{"name":"Tolga Inan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TED University, Cankaya, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6166811/6144727/6144727-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tolga \u0130nan received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2000, 2003, and 2011, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor at Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TED University, Ankara.

Our approach begins with registration, smoothing and uniform resampling of 3-D face data. Then, uniformly resampled 3-D face data are used to generate shape index, curvedness, gaussian and mean curvature values on each point of the data. Hence we obtain 2-D matrices of shape index, curvedness, gaussian and mean curvature values representing 3-D geometry information. SIFT descriptors are applied to 2-D matrices and high dimensional feature vector having shape information is obtained. Finally, high dimensional feature vector is projected to the low dimensional subspace where projection matrix is calculated by linear discriminant analysis. Features in this low dimensional subspace are compared by using cosine distance similarity metric. Proposed method is shown to have 98.35% and 98.25% detection rates at 0.001 false alarm rate for All vs. All and ROC3 experiments respectively on FRGC v2.0 database.

The lane detection algorithm returns lane positions using one camera and the vision module \u201cVisLab Embedded Lane Detector (VELD),\u201d and the pedestrian-crossing and speed-bump detection algorithms return the position of pedestrian crossings and speed bumps. The obstacle detection algorithm organizes data from LIDARs and generates a local obstacle position map. The designed algorithms have been implemented on a passenger car using six LIDARs, three cameras, and real-time devices, including personal computers (PCs). Vehicle tests have been conducted, and test results have shown that the vehicle can reach the desired goal with the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6205705/06144741.pdf","startPage":"974","endPage":"982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2179802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2179802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6205705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Environment-Detection-and-Mapping Algorithm for Autonomous Driving in Rural or Off-Road Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Algorithm design and analysis","Vehicles","Cameras","Roads","Detection algorithms","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","mobile robots","off-road vehicles","optical radar","radar imaging","road vehicle radar","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environment-detection-and-mapping algorithm","autonomous driving","rural environment","off-road environment","pedestrian-crossing","speed-bump detection algorithm","camera","obstacle detection algorithm","LIDAR","lane detection algorithm","vision module","VisLab embedded lane detector","passenger car","personal computer","vehicle testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous driving","lane detection","obstacle detection","pedestrian-crossing detection","speed-bump detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Environment-Detection-and-Mapping Algorithm for Autonomous Driving in Rural or Off-Road Environment","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6144741/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761769","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environment-Detection-and-Mapping Algorithm for Autonomous Driving in Rural or Off-Road Environment","sourcePdf":"tits-yi-2179802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084667S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6205705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6205705","articleId":"6144741","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6144749,"authors":[{"name":"Zihui Wang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6184677/6144749/6144749-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zihui Wang (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","From 2009 to 2010, he was a Research Assistant in the University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark.

Position estimation based on the back-EMF is most reliable in the medium-to high-speed range. For applications where low-speed operation is not required, a simple-structure back-EMF-based sensorless controller coupled with a simple startup procedure offers an attractive low-cost solution. This paper proposes a new startup procedure based on closed-loop current regulation. Compared to the existing methods, the new starting method can work under different load conditions and allows smooth transition from the startup procedure to the back-EMF-based sensorless control mode. In order to determine the successful use of the proposed method in various applications, it stability under different load conditions is discussed in detail. The proposed method is robust when it comes to the motor parameter variation and can be used for both surface-mounted PMSMs (SPMSMs) and interior PMSMs. The method presented in this paper is validated using the experimental results on an SPMSM.

In many cases, this channel state information (CSI) must be fed back from the receivers to the transmitter. We jointly design the channel estimators and the quantizers at the receivers together with the precoder at the transmitter based on a precoder-centric criterion, i.e., the minimization of a mean square error (MSE) metric appropriate for the precoder design. This is in contrast to our previous works, where the quantizer design was based on a CSI MSE metric, i.e., based on the minimization of the MSE between the true channel and the channel recovered by the transmitter using a feedback channel. Interestingly, the estimators resulting from this joint formulation are independent of the used codebook. The codebook entries are the employed precoders. Therefore, each receiver feeds back the index of a set of precoders and the intersection of the sets gives the appropriate precoder. Since the quantizers of the different receivers have to work separately, the metric for the computation of the partition cells cannot be expressed as a simple squared error depending on the quantizer output. The proposed system based on a joint optimization clearly outperforms previous designs with separate optimization of feedback and precoding.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6198804/06144751.pdf","startPage":"3101","endPage":"3111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2186446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2186446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Precoding With Limited Feedback Design Based on Precoding MSE for MU-MISO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Covariance matrix","Measurement","Optimization","Minimization","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel coding","channel estimation","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust precoding","limited feedback design","precoding MSE","MU-MISO systems","signal separation","vector broadcast channel","vector BC","radio transmitter","channel state information","channel estimators","channel quantizers","radio receivers","precoder-centric criterion","mean square error metric","CSI MSE metric","feedback channel","codebook","partition cells","joint optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian approach","feedback channel","imperfect CSI","precoding MSE metric","robust precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust Precoding With Limited Feedback Design Based on Precoding MSE for MU-MISO Systems","volume":"60","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6144751/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12725057","dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Precoding With Limited Feedback Design Based on Precoding MSE for MU-MISO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-joham-2186446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130411S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6198804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6198804","articleId":"6144751","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6144753,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Mittelbach","affiliation":["Communications Theory, Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6181849/6144753/6144753-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Mittelbach was born in Leinefelde, Germany, in 1978.

As the owner of the licensed radio spectrum, the MUEs possess strictly higher access priority over the FUEs; thus, their quality-of-service (QoS) performance, expressed in terms of the prescribed minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), must be maintained at all times. For the lower-tier FUEs, we explicitly consider two different design objectives, namely, throughput-power tradeoff optimization and soft QoS provisioning. With an effective dynamic pricing scheme combined with admission control to indirectly manage the cross-tier interference, the proposed schemes lend themselves to distributed algorithms that mainly require local information to offer maximized net utility of individual users. The approach employed in this work is particularly attractive, especially in view of practical implementation under the limited backhaul network capacity available for femtocells. It is shown that the proposed algorithms robustly support all the prioritized MUEs with guaranteed QoS requirements whenever feasible, while allowing the FUEs to optimally exploit the remaining network capacity. The convergence of the developed solutions is rigorously analyzed, and extensive numerical results are presented to illustrate their potential advantages.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.012712.110073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.012712.110073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6165622/06144758.pdf","startPage":"979","endPage":"989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Interference Management in Two-Tier CDMA Femtocell Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Interference Management in Two-Tier CDMA Femtocell Networks","volume":"11","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12578071","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144758/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Interference Management in Two-Tier CDMA Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"0979-tw1203-ngo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099969S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6165622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6165622","articleId":"6144758","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":6144760,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Jiang","affiliation":["LTE Research and Development Center, New Postcom Equipment Company Limited, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6165622/6144760/6144760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Jiang (S'04-M'07) received B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in 1999 and 2002 from South China University of Technology (SCUT), China, and Ph.D. degree in 2006 under the supervision of Prof. Lajos Hanzo from University of Southampton, UK, respectively, all in Electronic Engineering.

Among the numerous CE techniques in the literature, Pilot-Assisted Channel Estimation (PACE) has been widely used in many practical systems, thanks to its simplicity and efficiency for implementation. In order to minimise pilot overhead, interpolation is typically mandatory in PACE. Conventional linear and Polar-Linear Interpolation (PLI) methods are easy to implement, but naturally result in residual interpolation errors that can not be mitigated even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). In this paper, we propose a CE scheme equipped with a novel interpolation method referred to as Adaptive Polar-Linear Interpolation (APLI). The proposed APLI-aided CE scheme can achieve a good performance, thanks to its capability of adaptively tracking the instantaneous variation of channel's fading coefficients, while maintaining a low complexity that is similar to the simple linear interpolation. The benefits of our proposal are demonstrated by a range of numerical illustrations and simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.012712.101162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6165622/06144760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.012712.101162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165622","startPage":"920","endPage":"926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Polar-Linear Interpolation Aided Channel Estimation for Wireless Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Polar-Linear Interpolation Aided Channel Estimation for Wireless Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12578073","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6144760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Polar-Linear Interpolation Aided Channel Estimation for Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"0920-tw1203-jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052872S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6165622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6165622","articleId":"6144760","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6144762,"authors":[{"name":"Kwangwon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6165622/6144762/6144762-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kwangwon Lee (S'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

Equally important to their counterpart in the design of energy harvesting radios are the design principles that this new networking paradigm calls for. In particular, unlike wireless networks considered to date, the energy replenishment process and the storage constraints of the rechargeable batteries need to be taken into account in designing efficient transmission strategies. In this work, such transmission policies for rechargeable nodes are considered, and optimum solutions for two related problems are identified. Specifically, the transmission policy that maximizes the short term throughput, i.e., the amount of data transmitted in a finite time horizon is found. In addition, the relation of this optimization problem to another, namely, the minimization of the transmission completion time for a given amount of data is demonstrated, which leads to the solution of the latter as well. The optimum transmission policies are identified under the constraints on energy causality, i.e., energy replenishment process, as well as the energy storage, i.e., battery capacity. For battery replenishment, a model with discrete packets of energy arrivals is considered. The necessary conditions that the throughput-optimal allocation satisfies are derived, and then the algorithm that finds the optimal transmission policy with respect to the short-term throughput and the minimum transmission completion time is given. Numerical results are presented to confirm the analytical findings.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.012412.110805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6165622/06144764.pdf","startPage":"1180","endPage":"1189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.012412.110805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Transmission Policies for Battery Limited Energy Harvesting Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Transmission Policies for Battery Limited Energy Harvesting Nodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144764/","publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12578077","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144764/","volume":"11","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Transmission Policies for Battery Limited Energy Harvesting Nodes","sourcePdf":"1180-tw1203-tutun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080991S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6165622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"554","xplore-issue":"6165622","articleId":"6144764","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6144766,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrzad Malmirchegini","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6165622/6144766/6144766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehrzad Malmirchegini received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004 and the M.S. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran in 2007.

One of the characteristics of FBMC is that the demodulated transmitted symbols are accompanied by interference terms caused by the neighboring transmitted data in time-frequency domain. The presence of this interference is an issue for some multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes and until today their combination with FBMC remains an open problem. We can cite, among these techniques, the Alamouti scheme and the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) with spatial multiplexing (SM). In this paper, we shall propose a new FBMC scheme and transmission strategy in order to avoid this interference term. This proposed scheme (called FFT-FBMC) transforms the FBMC system into an equivalent system formulated as OFDM regardless of some residual interference. Thus, any OFDM transmission technique can be performed straightforwardly to the proposed FBMC scheme with a corresponding complexity growth compared to the classical FBMC. First, we will develop the FFT-FBMC in the case of single-input single-output (SISO) configuration. Then, we extend its application to SM-MIMO configuration with MLD and Alamouti coding scheme. Simulation results show that FFT-FBMC can almost reach the OFDM performance, but it remains slightly outperformed by OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.012412.110607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6165622/06144767.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.012412.110607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Filter-Bank Multicarrier Scheme to Mitigate the Intrinsic Interference: Application to MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Filter-Bank Multicarrier Scheme to Mitigate the Intrinsic Interference: Application to MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144767/","publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12578080","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144767/","volume":"11","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Filter-Bank Multicarrier Scheme to Mitigate the Intrinsic Interference: Application to MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1112-tw1203-zakaria.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122275S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6165622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"6165622","articleId":"6144767","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6144768,"authors":[{"name":"Kurtis D.

The neuron and synapse subcircuits include ambipolar nano-crystalline silicon transistor and memristor device models based on measured data. Neuron circuit characteristics and the Hebbian synaptic learning rule are shown to be similar to biology. Changes in the average firing rate learning rule depending on various circuit parameters are also presented. The subcircuits are then connected into larger neural networks that demonstrate fundamental properties including associative learning and pulse coincidence detection. Learned extraction of a fundamental frequency component from noisy inputs is demonstrated. It is then shown that if the fundamental sinusoid of one neuron input is out of phase with the rest, its synaptic connection changes differently than the others. Such behavior indicates that the system can learn to detect which signals are important in the general population, and that there is a spike-timing-dependent component of the learning mechanism. Finally, future circuit design and considerations are discussed, including requirements for the memristive device.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6163421/06144768.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2184801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2184801","startPage":"565","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Learning Circuits Utilizing Nano-Crystalline Silicon Transistors and Memristors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144768/","displayDocTitle":"Neural Learning Circuits Utilizing Nano-Crystalline Silicon Transistors and Memristors","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144768/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"12571537","pubMedId":"24805040","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Learning Circuits Utilizing Nano-Crystalline Silicon Transistors and Memristors","sourcePdf":"tnnls-cantley-2184801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1129S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6163421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6163421","articleId":"6144768","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6144840,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuo Ito","affiliation":["Information System Science, Soka University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuo","lastName":"Ito","id":"38235429500"},{"name":"Akimasa Suzuki","affiliation":["Information System Science, Soka University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akimasa","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"38186377100"},{"name":"Taketoshi Iyota","affiliation":["Information System Science, Soka University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Taketoshi","lastName":"Iyota","id":"37828119200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0330-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0329-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0328-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6144840","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"This paper proposes the echo ranging system with spread spectrum ultrasonic signals for automobile robots.

TWIP offers extensive research diversity from modeling to control method. In control engineering, tuning of TWIP, which is a linear time invariant (LTI) system, has been well studied. In contrast, this paper emphasizes on time variant system of TWIP. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed for adaptive tuning of the TWIP. To avoid instable problem due to wide search space area used, integral absolute error (IAE) mesh is considered, which is important to ensure that the region where TWIP operates is stable and optimal. Simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling online PSO tuning scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICARA.2011.6144873","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Conference on Automation, Robotics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138561/6144838/06144873.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Conference on Automation, Robotics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARA.2011.6144873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive control of two wheel inverted pendulum robot based on particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Robots","Torque","Stability analysis","Mathematical model","Equations","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","mesh generation","mobile robots","nonlinear control systems","particle swarm optimisation","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","two wheel inverted pendulum robot","particle swarm optimization","control engineering","linear time invariant system","time variant system","integral absolute error mesh","online PSO tuning scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","inverted pendulum","integral error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6144873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive control of two wheel inverted pendulum robot based on particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6144873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12526847","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive control of two wheel inverted pendulum robot based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Wellington, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"ICARA151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075121S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138561","isNumber":"6144838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138561","xplore-issue":"6144838","articleId":"6144873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6144883,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Johnen","affiliation":["Industrial Robotics and Production Automation (IRPA), TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Johnen","id":"38234301100"},{"name":"Carsten Scheele","affiliation":["Industrial Robotics and Production Automation (IRPA), TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Scheele","id":"38234301200"},{"name":"Bernd Kuhlenk\u00f6tter","affiliation":["Industrial Robotics and Production Automation (IRPA), TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Kuhlenk\u00f6tter","id":"38234300300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0330-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0329-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0328-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6144883","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Artificial neural networks","Coordinate measuring machines","Position measurement","Light emitting diodes","Service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","calibration","coordinate measuring machines","industrial robots","mobile robots","multilayer perceptrons","path planning","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","coordinate measuring machine calibration","dynamic positioning behavior","static positioning behavior","industrial robot","training data","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","common reference system","network design","robot path segment","varying motion parameter","feedforward network","backpropagation learning algorithms","multilayer network","forward transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Industrial robot","artificial neural network","coordinate measuring machine","simulation","model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6144883","abstract":"In this paper the design and evaluation of artificial neural networks for learning static and dynamic positioning behavior of an industrial robot are presented.

To design the masking-based Wiener filter, the spectrum of beamforming output is classified into noise spectrum and speech spectrum at each spectral bin by the inter-channel time delay between two reference inputs. Hamming windowing for the speech spectrum and noise spectrum is separately performed to smooth each spectrum. Then, the Wiener filtering is applied to the beamforming output.

In future SG, vast amount of data will be generated by smart meters, PMU based WAMS, SCADA and other monitoring devices. While research has been done to find suitable compression technologies to store power system disturbance and PMU data; there is lack of research on the storage of SCADA data which is basically steady state operational data of the grid. Presently, utilities store some important SCADA data for a limited period and then they either delete them or store them in unreliable manner (CD/DVD etc.). The investigations presented here explore the application of Principal Component Analysis based lossy compression technique for archiving the steady state operational data. Four important operational data - voltage, line flow, MW and MVAr generation are considered for the study. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated considering practical data pertaining to the Southern Regional Grid of India. The results illustrate the usefulness of the technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"ISGT2011-India","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138562/6145322/06145362.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"ISGT2011-India","doi":"10.1109/ISET-India.2011.6145362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISET-India.2011.6145362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal component analysis based compression scheme for power system steady state operational data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Phasor measurement units","Steady-state","Vectors","Covariance matrix","Smart grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phasor measurement","power system faults","principal component analysis","SCADA systems","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis","compression scheme","power system steady state operational data","digital instruments","smart grids","smart meters","PMU-based WAMS","monitoring devices","power system disturbance","SCADA data","lossy-compression technique","voltage generation","line flow generation","MW generation","MVAr generation","Southern Regional Grid of India"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data archiving","compression","power system","steady state data","PMU","Principal Component Analysis","SCADA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Principal component analysis based compression scheme for power system steady state operational data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145362/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539718","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal component analysis based compression scheme for power system steady state operational data","confLoc":"Kollam, India","sourcePdf":"paper47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048426S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138562","isNumber":"6145322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138562","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6145322","articleId":"6145362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6145364,"authors":[{"name":"Babasaheb Kharbas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Babasaheb","lastName":"Kharbas","id":"37659150800"},{"name":"Manoj Fozdar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Manoj","lastName":"Fozdar","id":"38486065500"},{"name":"Harpal Tiwari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Harpal","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37690604200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0315-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0316-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0314-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6145364","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Pricing","Load modeling","Smart grids","Integrated circuit modeling","Resource management","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["costing","power markets","power transmission economics","tariffs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission tariff allocation","MW-mile-postage stamp methods","electricity market","energy transportation services","cost recovery","transmission facility ARR recovery","six-bus network","transmission service cost","transmission utility","Matlab"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmission tariff","MW-Mile Method","Postage Stamp Method","Residual Transmission Charges","Demand variation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145364","abstract":"The transmission tariff function will facilitate competitive electricity market by impartially providing energy transportation services to all energy buyers and sellers, while fairly recovering the cost of providing those services.

First, the cognitive behavior of particle is influenced by best and worst experience. Second, three acceleration coefficients, instead of two as in the conventional PSO, are suggested. Third, the acceleration coefficients are made variable rather than assigning them merely a fixed value.

This tool provides a coordinate system to analyze a class of non-Gaussian input distributions that are invariant over Gaussian networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145470.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2169536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2169536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coordinate System for Gaussian Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Interference","Gaussian distribution","Polynomials","Gaussian noise","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","Hermitian matrices","information theory","intersymbol interference","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinate system","Gaussian networks","network information theory","Gaussian broadcast channel","coherent fading","Gaussian interference channel","nonGaussian code ensembles","Shamai-Laroia conjecture","Gaussian ISI channel","geometrical tool","Hermite polynomials","nonGaussian input distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast channel","Gaussian channels","Hermite polynomials","information geometry","interference","network information theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Coordinate System for Gaussian Networks","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6145470/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509295","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coordinate System for Gaussian Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-abbe-2169536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10687S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145473,"authors":[{"name":"Rudolf Ahlswede","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Rudolf Ahlswede was born in Dielmissen, Germany, in September 15, 1938.

This problem is an extension of single channel sparse recovery, which lies at the heart of compressed sensing. Inspired by the links to array signal processing, a new family of MMV algorithms is considered that highlight the role of rank in determining the difficulty of the MMV recovery problem. The simplest such method is a discrete version of MUSIC which is guaranteed to recover the sparse vectors in the full rank MMV setting, under mild conditions. This idea is extended to a rank aware pursuit algorithm that naturally reduces to Order Recursive Matching Pursuit (ORMP) in the single measurement case while also providing guaranteed recovery in the full rank setting. In contrast, popular MMV methods such as Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP) and mixed norm minimization techniques are shown to be rank blind in terms of worst case analysis. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the rank aware techniques are significantly better than existing methods in dealing with multiple measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145474.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank Awareness in Joint Sparse Recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Rank Awareness in Joint Sparse Recovery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145474/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12509299","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145474/","volume":"58","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank Awareness in Joint Sparse Recovery","sourcePdf":"tit-davies-2173722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130673S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6145475,"authors":[{"name":"David L.

To analyze the unsolved case, we point out the potential of interference alignment in the 2-user MIMO interference channel with no channel state information at the transmitters.

As our main result, we establish the upper and lower bounds on the secret-key capacity. In the lower bound expression, the equivocation terms of the source and channel components are functionally additive even though the coding scheme generates a single secret-key by jointly taking into account the source and channel equivocations. Our bounds coincide, thus establishing the capacity, when the underlying wiretap channel can be decomposed into a set of independent, parallel, and reversely degraded channels. For the case of parallel Gaussian channels and jointly Gaussian sources we show that Gaussian codebooks achieve the secret-key capacity. In addition, when the eavesdropper also observes a correlated side information sequence, we establish the secret-key capacity when both the source and channel of the eavesdropper are a degraded version of the legitimate receiver. We finally also treat the case when a public discussion channel is available, propose a separation based coding scheme, and establish its optimality when the channel output symbols of the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper are conditionally independent given the input.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","volume":"58","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"12509306","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145481/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secret-Key Generation Using Correlated Sources and Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret-Key Generation Using Correlated Sources and Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-khisti-2173629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110911S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6145501,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxuan Ye","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, L.L.C., King of Prussia, PA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Chunxuan Ye (S'01\u2013M'06\u2013SM'10) received the B.Eng.

The performance of low-density parity check channel codes in devising a new class of secret keys is examined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret Key and Private Key Constructions for Simple Multiterminal Source Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173731","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145501.pdf","startPage":"639","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Secret Key and Private Key Constructions for Simple Multiterminal Source Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6145501/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509312","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret Key and Private Key Constructions for Simple Multiterminal Source Models","sourcePdf":"tit-narayan-2173731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095676S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145503,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Swedish Strategic Center for High Speed Wireless Communication and the Department of Electrical andInformation Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Fredrik Rusek was born in Lund, Sweden in 1978.

We significantly improve this decoding scheme by developing a new feedback adjustment strategy for the standard BP algorithm. In our feedback procedure, we exploit much of the information from stabilizers, not just the syndrome but also the values of the frustrated checks on individual qubits of the code and the channel model. Furthermore we show that our decoding algorithm is superior to belief propagation algorithms using only the syndrome in the feedback procedure for all cases of the depolarizing channel. Our algorithm does not increase the measurement overhead compared to the previous method, as the extra information comes for free from the requisite stabilizer measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2169534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2169534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145510.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Feedback Iterative Decoding of Sparse Quantum Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Feedback Iterative Decoding of Sparse Quantum Codes","volume":"58","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145510/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509321","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145510/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Feedback Iterative Decoding of Sparse Quantum Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2169534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139932S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6145511,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Systems and Applications (CWSA), School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chih-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292502400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6145511","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity of 1-to-- Broadcast Packet Erasure Channels With Channel Output Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Encoding","Network coding","Output feedback","Interference","Decoding","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","linear programming","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1-to-K broadcast packet erasure channels","channel output feedback","1-to-K broadcast PEC","binary erasure channel","K receivers","l-to-3 broadcast PEC","one- sided fairness constraints","inner bounds","outer bounds","linear programming solver","intersession network coding schemes","packet evolution schemes","interference alignment techniques","Euclidean space","COF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast capacity","channel output feedback","network code alignment","network coding","packet erasure channels"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the 1-to-K broadcast packet erasure channel (PEC), a generalization of the broadcast binary erasure channel from the binary symbol to a finite field G F(q) with sufficiently large q.

This paper also develops (iii) A pair of outer and inner bounds of the capacity region for arbitrary 1-to-K broadcast PECs, which can be easily evaluated by any linear programming solver. The proposed inner bound is proven by a new class of intersession network coding schemes, termed the packet evolution schemes, which is based on the concept of code alignment in GF(q) that is in parallel with the interference alignment techniques for the Euclidean space. Extensive numerical experiments show that the outer and inner bounds meet for almost all broadcast PECs encountered in practical scenarios and thus effectively bracket the capacity of general 1-to-K broadcast PECs with COF.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145511.pdf","startPage":"931","endPage":"956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145511/","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of 1-to-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula> Broadcast Packet Erasure Channels With Channel Output Feedback","volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509322","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of 1-to-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula> Broadcast Packet Erasure Channels With Channel Output Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2173723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041281S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"60","articleId":"6145511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6145513,"authors":[{"name":"Uri Erez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Uri Erez (M'03) was born in Tel-Aviv, Israel, on October 27, 1971.

We show by construction that perfect rateless codes with low-complexity decoding algorithms exist for additive white Gaussian noise channels. Our construction involves the use of layered encoding and successive decoding, together with repetition using time-varying layer weights. As an illustration of our framework, we design a practical three-rate code family. We further construct rich sets of near-perfect rateless codes within our architecture that require either significantly fewer layers or lower complexity than their perfect counterparts. Variations of the basic construction are also developed, including one for time-varying channels in which there is no a priori stochastic model.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173242","startPage":"530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145513.pdf","endPage":"547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145513/","displayDocTitle":"Rateless Coding for Gaussian Channels","volume":"58","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6145513/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12509324","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rateless Coding for Gaussian Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-wornell-2173242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106867S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6145516,"authors":[{"name":"Avi Zanko","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Avi Zenko received the B.Sc.

In this paper, two designs of STBC are proposed for any number of transmit antennas that can obtain full diversity when a PIC group decoding (with a particular grouping scheme) is applied at receiver. With the PIC group decoding and an appropriate grouping scheme for the decoding, the proposed STBC are shown to obtain the same diversity gain as the ML decoding, but have a low decoding complexity. The first proposed STBC is designed with multiple diagonal layers and it can obtain the full diversity for two-layer design with the PIC group decoding and the rate is up to 2 symbols per channel use. With PIC-SIC group decoding, the first proposed STBC can obtain full diversity for any number of layers and the rate can be full. The second proposed STBC can obtain full diversity and a rate up to 9/4 with the PIC group decoding. Some code design examples are given and simulation results show that the newly proposed STBC can well address the rate-performance-complexity tradeoff of the MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two Designs of Space-Time Block Codes Achieving Full Diversity With Partial Interference Cancellation Group Decoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145517.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Two Designs of Space-Time Block Codes Achieving Full Diversity With Partial Interference Cancellation Group Decoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6145517/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509328","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Designs of Space-Time Block Codes Achieving Full Diversity With Partial Interference Cancellation Group Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-zhang-2173268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120059S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145521,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Feng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Hsiao-Feng (Francis) Lu (S'98-M'04) received the B.S. degree from Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, in 1999 and 2003, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada, during 2003\u20132004.

Multihop amplify-and-forward allows for a (noisy) linear combination of signals simultaneously sent from multiple sources to be propagated through the network over multiple layers of relays. The performance of multihop amplify-and-forward is limited by noise propagated to the destination over multiple hops, and we expect this strategy to perform well only in high SNR. In this paper, this intuition is formalized and high-SNR conditions under which multihop amplify-and-forward approaches capacity in a layered relay network are determined. By relating the received signal power and the received power of the propagated noise at the nodes, the rate achievable with multihop amplify-and-forward is determined. In particular, when all received powers are lower bounded by \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$1/\\delta $</tex></formula>\n, the noise power propagated to the destination over \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$L$</tex></formula>\n layers is of the order \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$L\\delta $</tex></formula>\n. The result demonstrates that multihop amplify-and-forward approaches the cut-set bound as received powers at relays increase. As all powers in the network increase at the same rate, the multihop amplify-and-forward rate and the upper bound are within a gap that is independent of channel gains. This gap grows linearly with the number of nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173721","startPage":"793","endPage":"803","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145524.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop Analog Network Coding via Amplify-and-Forward: The High SNR Regime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multihop Analog Network Coding via Amplify-and-Forward: The High SNR Regime","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","volume":"58","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145524/","accessionNumber":"12509332","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145524/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop Analog Network Coding via Amplify-and-Forward: The High SNR Regime","sourcePdf":"tit-maric-2173721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078294S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6145525,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Minero","affiliation":["Wireless Institute at the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Paolo Minero (M'11) received the Laurea degree (with highest honors) in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 2003, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at San Diego in 2010.

Active senders encode data into independent information streams, a subset of which is decoded depending on the collective interference. An information-theoretic formulation of the problem is presented and the set of achievable rates is characterized with a guaranteed gap to optimality. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of a two-sender system are tight in the case of a binary-expansion deterministic channel and differ by less than one bit in the case of a Gaussian channel. In systems with an arbitrary number of senders, the symmetric scenario of equal access probabilities and received power constraints is studied and the system throughput, i.e., the maximum achievable expected sum rate, is characterized. It is shown that a simple coding scheme where active senders transmit a single message is optimum for a binary-expansion deterministic channel and achieves within one bit of the optimum in the case of a Gaussian channel. Finally, a comparison with the slotted ALOHA protocol is provided, showing that encoding rate adaptation at the transmitters achieves constant (rather than zero) throughput as the number of users tends to infinity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145525.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Access: An Information-Theoretic Perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Receivers","Transmitters","Additives","Throughput","Channel models","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","Gaussian channels","information theory","multi-access systems","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random access","information-theoretic perspective","two-sender system","binary-expansion deterministic channel","Gaussian channel","access probability","power constraint","coding scheme","slotted ALOHA protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast approach","capacity","multiple-access channels","network information theory","random access","slotted ALOHA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Random Access: An Information-Theoretic Perspective","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6145525/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509333","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Access: An Information-Theoretic Perspective","sourcePdf":"tit-minero-2173711-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109577S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145525","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145526,"authors":[{"name":"Seongwook Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Seongwook Jeong received the B.S. degree with honor in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles in 2005.

When evaluated on a number of well-known finite-ISI channels, these new bounds provide a very similar level of tightness against the SIR to the conjectured lower bound by Shamai and Laroia at all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while being actually tighter when viewed closed up at high SNRs. The new lower bounds are obtained in two steps: First, a \u201cmismatched\u201d mutual information function is introduced which can be proved as a lower bound to I(X; X+S+N). Secondly, this function is further bounded from below by an expression that can be computed easily via a few single-dimensional integrations with a small computational load.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6145469/06145526.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Easily Computed Lower Bounds on the Information Rate of Intersymbol Interference Channels","volume":"58","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145526/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509334","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145526/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Easily Computed Lower Bounds on the Information Rate of Intersymbol Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-moon-2173715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085488S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6145469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6145469","articleId":"6145526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6145587,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Chen","affiliation":["National ICT Australia, Victoria Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Liang Chen received the B.E. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2003, and the M.S. degree from the University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic., Australia, in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","During the winter of 2010, he was a Visiting Researcher at the National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan.

Due to the unipolarity of the IM/DD channel, asymmetric clipping and associated nonlinear distortion is inevitable, resulting in an unfavorable dc power and a significant performance penalty. Using a detailed analysis of the clipped signal, our recent work focused on reducing this clipping-resulted dc via both power optimization and frequency planning. In this paper, a set of effective receiver signal-to-noise ratio formulas is proposed, which helps in accurately and efficiently evaluating the system performance across various optical OFDM systems. We conduct a power efficiency analysis to reveal tradeoffs between power and spectral efficiencies among different systems. Our results show that with a cost of additional complexity, a diversity-combining technique offers significant benefits in all cases.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2185779","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6154792/06145587.pdf","startPage":"974","endPage":"983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2185779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6154792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis for Optical OFDM Transmission in Short-Range IM/DD Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145587/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis for Optical OFDM Transmission in Short-Range IM/DD Systems","volume":"30","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2012","accessionNumber":"12543415","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145587/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis for Optical OFDM Transmission in Short-Range IM/DD Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-chen-2185779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100626S","chronDate":"April1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6154792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6154792","articleId":"6145587","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145588,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowen Dong","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaowen Dong received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2005, and the M.E. degree (Hons.) in electronic engineering from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, Ireland, in October 2008.

We consider the National Science Foundation network topology and compare its energy consumption with the energy consumption of optimized physical topologies under different IP over WDM approaches and nodal degree constraints. We study the physical topology optimization under a symmetric full-mesh connectivity traffic matrix and an asymmetric traffic demand, where data centers create a hot node scenario in the network. We also investigate the power savings obtained by deploying topologies that eliminate the need for IP routers, including a full-mesh topology and a star topology. Simulation results show that the full-mesh and star topologies result in significant power savings of 95% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the optimization of the physical topology is investigated considering the presence of renewable energy sources in the network.

In particular, disturbance attenuation and optimal control problems for nonlinear systems are generally solved exploiting the solution of the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) inequality and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, respectively. An explicit closed-form solution of this inequality, or equation, may however be hard or impossible to find in practical situations. Herein we introduce a methodology to circumvent this issue for input-affine nonlinear systems proposing a dynamic, i.e., time-varying, approximate solution of the HJ inequality and of the HJB equation the construction of which does not require solving any partial differential equation or inequality. This is achieved considering the immersion of the underlying nonlinear system into an augmented system defined on an extended state-space in which a (locally) positive definite storage function, or value function, can be explicitly constructed. The result is a methodology to design a dynamic controller to achieve \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-disturbance attenuation or approximate optimality, with asymptotic stability.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2012.2186716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6310106/06145614.pdf","startPage":"2490","endPage":"2503","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2012.2186716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Approximate Solutions of the HJ Inequality and of the HJB Equation for Input-Affine Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Approximate Solutions of the HJ Inequality and of the HJB Equation for Input-Affine Nonlinear Systems","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6145614/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13014538","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145614/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Approximate Solutions of the HJ Inequality and of the HJB Equation for Input-Affine Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-sassano-2186716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110363S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6310106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6310106","articleId":"6145614","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6145622,"authors":[{"name":"Cameron B.

Without using electron tunneling, the proposed circuit not only avoids multiplexing high-voltage signals but also facilitates direct storage of new data. In addition, each memory cell incorporates a simple inverter to make the programming process nearly linear, facilitating bidirectional and linear adaptability for neuromorphic systems. A prototype array of the analog memory has been fabricated with the standard CMOS 0.35- technology. The chip includes a simple on-chip comparator to program the analog memory accurately and automatically by negative feedback. The effective resolution is more than 8 bits over a dynamic range of 1.4 V.

It employs the estimated coefficients as prior information to minimize the exponentially weighted observation error, which leads to reduced variance over a conventional RLS algorithm and reduced bias over an L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-regularized RLS algorithm. To improve the tracking performance, a new measure of convergence status is introduced in controlling the forgetting factor. Consequently, the resultant SR-VFF-RLS algorithm stabilizes the update and adaptively selects the number of measurements by means of the VFF. Improved tracking performance, steady-state mean-square error, and robustness to power-varying inputs over conventional RLS algorithms can be achieved. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be implemented using QRD, which leads to a lower roundoff error and more efficient hardware realization than the direct implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6169168/06145625.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2012.2184374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2012.2184374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169168","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New State-Regularized QRRLS Algorithm With a Variable Forgetting Factor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Signal processing algorithms","Least squares approximation","Convergence","Robustness","Steady-state","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","convergence of numerical methods","least squares approximations","mean square error methods","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-regularized algorithm","QR-decomposition-based recursive least squares algorithm","adaptive filtering algorithm","variable forgetting factor","exponentially weighted observation error minimization","reduced variance","reduced bias","L2-regularized RLS algorithm","tracking performance","convergence status","steady-state mean-square error","power-varying inputs","efficient hardware realization","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters","QR decomposition (QRD)","recursive least squares (RLS)","variable regularization","variable forgetting factor (VFF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"A New State-Regularized QRRLS Algorithm With a Variable Forgetting Factor","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6145625/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592523","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New State-Regularized QRRLS Algorithm With a Variable Forgetting Factor","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chan-2184374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150535S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6169168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6169168","articleId":"6145625","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145627,"authors":[{"name":"Worapan Kusakunniran","affiliation":["Neville Roach Laboratory, NICTA, Kensington, NSW, Australia","School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6145627/6145627-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Worapan Kusakunniran (M'10) received the B.

However, in reality, change of viewing angle causes significant challenge for gait recognition. A novel approach using regression-based view transformation model (VTM) is proposed to address this challenge. Gait features from across views can be normalized into a common view using learned VTM(s). In principle, a VTM is used to transform gait feature from one viewing angle (source) into another viewing angle (target). It consists of multiple regression processes to explore correlated walking motions, which are encoded in gait features, between source and target views. In the learning processes, sparse regression based on the elastic net is adopted as the regression function, which is free from the problem of overfitting and results in more stable regression models for VTM construction. Based on widely adopted gait database, experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves upon existing VTM-based methods and outperforms most other baseline methods reported in the literature. Several practical scenarios of applying the proposed method for gait recognition under various views are also discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2186744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6209393/06145627.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2186744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6209393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gait Recognition Under Various Viewing Angles Based on Correlated Motion Regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145627/","displayDocTitle":"Gait Recognition Under Various Viewing Angles Based on Correlated Motion Regression","volume":"22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12769199","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145627/","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gait Recognition Under Various Viewing Angles Based on Correlated Motion Regression","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-kusakunniran-2186744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170624S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6209393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6209393","articleId":"6145627","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145640,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongrui Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Z.

Many reported results have shown that IT2 FLCs are better able to handle uncertainties than their type-1 (T1) counterparts. A challenging question is the following: What are the fundamental differences between IT2 and T1 FLCs? Once the fundamental differences are clear, we can better understand the advantages of IT2 FLCs and, hence, make better use of them. This paper explains two fundamental differences between IT2 and T1 FLCs: 1) Adaptiveness, meaning that the embedded T1 fuzzy sets used to compute the bounds of the type-reduced interval change as input changes; and 2) Novelty, meaning that the upper and lower membership functions of the same IT2 fuzzy set may be used simultaneously in computing each bound of the type-reduced interval. T1 FLCs do not have these properties; thus, a T1 FLC cannot implement the complex control surface of an IT2 FLC given the same rulebase. We also present several methods to visualize and analyze the effects of these two fundamental differences, including the control surface, the P-map, the equivalent generalized T1 fuzzy sets, and the equivalent PI gains. Finally, we examine five alternative type reducers for IT2 FLCs and explain why they do not capture the fundamentals of IT2 FLCs.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2186818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6319448/06145645.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2186818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Fundamental Differences Between Interval Type-2 and Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145645/","displayDocTitle":"On the Fundamental Differences Between Interval Type-2 and Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controllers","volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030440","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Fundamental Differences Between Interval Type-2 and Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controllers","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wu-2186818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05714S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","isNumber":"6319448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"187","articleId":"6145645","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145647,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Shen Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","School of Engineering, Technology and Maritime Operations, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6296744/6145647/6145647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chee Shen Lim (S'10) was born in Pulau Pinang, Malaysia, in 1985.

As an alternative to existing methods, use of MPC in multimachine drives has the advantages of independent fast current control of the machines, elimination of the closed-loop system's cascaded structure, and a reduced number of microcontrollers. A vector control algorithm is required, necessitating state-space modeling, with each machine's direct- and quadrature-axis currents chosen as state variables. Prediction of future states is via a discrete-time model of the five-leg inverter and a piecewise-affine model of two permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). A method which eliminates unfeasible switching states inherent in reduced-switch-count inverters while reducing computation and sampling times is proposed. The algorithm is implemented in a TMS320F28335 DSP microcontroller, which controls the five-leg inverter and the two PMSMs. Simulation and experimental results validate the presented control concept.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2186770","startPage":"54","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6296744/06145647.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2186770","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control of a Two-Motor Drive With Five-Leg-Inverter Supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control of a Two-Motor Drive With Five-Leg-Inverter Supply","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6145647/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12968384","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control of a Two-Motor Drive With Five-Leg-Inverter Supply","sourcePdf":"tie-levi-2186770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090645S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6296744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6296744","articleId":"6145647","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145648,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuyoshi Mutoh","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6191366/6145648/6145648-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nobuyoshi Mutoh (M'89\u2013SM'92) received the first half of the Ph.D. degree from the Science and Engineering Research Division, Graduate School, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1975, where he received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 1991.","In April 1975, he was with the Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi, Japan.

The ideal characteristics of a FRID EV promote good performance and safety and are the result of structural features that independently control the driving and braking torques of the front and rear wheels. The first characteristic is the failsafe function. This function enables vehicles to continue running without any unexpected or sudden stops, even if one of the propulsion systems fails. The second characteristic is a function that performs efficient acceleration and deceleration on all road surfaces. This function works by distributing the driving or braking torques to the front and rear wheels, taking into consideration load movement. The third characteristic ensures that the vehicle runs safely on roads with a low friction coefficient (\u03bc), such as icy roads. In this paper, we propose a driving torque distribution method when cornering and a braking torque distribution method; these methods are related to the third characteristic, and they are particularly effective when driving on roads with ultralow \u03bc. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed torque control methods through simulations and experiments on the ultralow-\u03bc road surface with a \u03bc of 0.1.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12694709","htmlLink":"/document/6145648/","displayDocTitle":"Driving and Braking Torque Distribution Methods for Front- and Rear-Wheel-Independent Drive-Type Electric Vehicles on Roads With Low Friction Coefficient","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driving and Braking Torque Distribution Methods for Front- and Rear-Wheel-Independent Drive-Type Electric Vehicles on Roads With Low Friction Coefficient","sourcePdf":"tie-mutoh-2186772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073209S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6191366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6191366","articleId":"6145648","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6145650,"authors":[{"name":"Max A.

A centralized controller presents a single critical point of failure which has prevented a truly modular and fault-tolerant system from being obtained. This study analyzes the inverter circuit control requirements during normal operation and grid fault ride-through and proposes a distributed controller design to allow inverter modules to operate independently of each other. All the modules independently estimate the grid voltage magnitude and position, and the modules are synchronized together over a controller area network (CAN) bus. The CAN bus is also used to interleave the pulsewidth modulation switching of the modules and synchronize the analog to digital converter (ADC) sampling. The controller structure and algorithms are tested by laboratory experiments with respect to normal operation, initial synchronization to the grid, module fault tolerance, and grid fault ride-through.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Control of a Fault-Tolerant Modular Multilevel Inverter for Direct-Drive Wind Turbine Grid Interfacing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2186774","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6302244/06145650.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2186774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6302244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Control of a Fault-Tolerant Modular Multilevel Inverter for Direct-Drive Wind Turbine Grid Interfacing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6145650/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13014611","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Control of a Fault-Tolerant Modular Multilevel Inverter for Direct-Drive Wind Turbine Grid Interfacing","sourcePdf":"tie-parker-2186774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073158S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6302244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6302244","articleId":"6145650","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6145652,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposed charger acts as a current source, i.e., acts in constant-current (CC) mode with a controlled output current in case of deep discharge of a battery, and as a voltage source, i.e., acts in constant-voltage (CV) mode with a controlled output voltage for near-100% battery state of charge. The proposed circuit is universal from the battery voltage point of view, i.e., can charge a battery with any given voltage rating, and adaptive from the optimum charging current requirement viewpoint, i.e., can adapt to the optimum battery charging current. The presented solution uses a magnetically coupled bidirectional converter topology. In order to make the system feedback controlled during the whole cycle of charging, the regulation loop is clamped, and hence, automatic and smooth transition from the CC to CV mode is achieved without the need of any extra switching circuit or control loop. Experimental and simulation results for a 250-W prototype are presented to verify the proposed system. The prototype shows maximum efficiencies of 90.24% under boost mode and 92.7% under buck mode of operation.

Networked Visual Servo Control","abstract":"The performance of vision-based control systems, in particular, of highly dynamic vision-based motion control systems, is often limited by the low sampling rate of the visual feedback caused by the long image processing time. In order to overcome this problem, the networked visual servo control (NVSC), which integrates networked computational resources for cloud image processing, is considered in this paper. The main contributions of this paper are the following: 1) a real-time transport protocol for transmitting large-volume image data on a cloud-computing platform, which enables high-sampling-rate visual feedback; 2) a stabilizing control law for the NVSC system with time-varying feedback time delay; and 3) a sending rate scheduling strategy aiming at reducing the communication network load. The performance of the NVSC system with sending rate scheduling is validated in an object-tracking scenario on a 14-DOF dual-arm robot. Experimental results show the superior performance of our approach. In particular, the communication network load is substantially reduced by means of the scheduling strategy without performance degradation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145653/","volume":"60","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13014613","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-Based Networked Visual Servo Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-Based Networked Visual Servo Control","sourcePdf":"tie-wu-2186775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083061S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6302244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","articleId":"6145653","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6145655,"authors":[{"name":"Victor N.

As a consequence, in addition, so-called execution models were proposed to specify the execution order of FBs. The variety of models leads to the incompatibility of tools and hinders the portability of automation software. To achieve a degree of execution model independence, in this paper, design patterns are suggested that make FB systems-robust to changes of execution semantics. A semantic-robust pattern is defined for a particular source execution model. The patterns themselves are implemented by means of the FB apparatus and therefore are fairly universal. The patterns can be defined and implemented using the FB transformations expressed in terms of Attributed Graph Grammars.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2186820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6179486/06145655.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2186820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179486","startPage":"279","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantics-Robust Design Patterns for IEC 61499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semantics-Robust Design Patterns for IEC 61499","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12653920","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6145655/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantics-Robust Design Patterns for IEC 61499","sourcePdf":"tii-vyatkin-2186820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096115S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6179486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6179486","articleId":"6145655","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145663,"authors":[{"name":"Radha S.

Due to their large quantity and complex charging behavior, the impact of substantial PHEVs charging on the power grid needs to be investigated. Since the charging behavior of PHEVs in a certain regional transmission network or a local distribution network is determined by different uncertain factors, their overall charging demand tends to be uncertain and in this situation probabilistic power flow (PPF) can be applied to analyze the impact of PHEVs charging on the power grid. However, currently there is no suitable model of the overall charging demand of PHEVs available for PPF calculations. In this paper, a methodology of modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs is proposed. The proposed methodology establishes a single PHEV charging demand model, and then employs queuing theory to describe the behavior of multiple PHEVs. Moreover, two applications are given, i.e., modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs at an EV charging station and in a local residential community, respectively. Comparison between PPF calculations and Monte Carlo simulation are made on a modified IEEE 30-bus system integrated with the two demand models proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2172643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/06145673.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2172643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","startPage":"492","endPage":"499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Charging Demand in Probabilistic Power Flow Calculations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Charging Demand in Probabilistic Power Flow Calculations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145673/","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6145673/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543469","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Charging Demand in Probabilistic Power Flow Calculations","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhang-2172643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081518S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"291","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6145673","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":6145674,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin K.

It is demonstrated that, even for high noise signal, the proposed algorithm is able to accurately estimate the number of frequency components present in the signal. The proposed method is capable of estimating the accurate values of frequency, amplitude, and phase angle of the distorted current or voltage signals for a wide range of sampling frequency and measurement noise. The robustness of the proposed method has been tested on several simulated synthetic signals and measured experimental signals for different nonlinear loads.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2182709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6212437/06145674.pdf","startPage":"1915","endPage":"1923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6212437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2182709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Exact Model Order ESPRIT Technique for Harmonics and Interharmonics Estimation","volume":"61","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145674/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12773106","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145674/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Model Order ESPRIT Technique for Harmonics and Interharmonics Estimation","sourcePdf":"tim-jain-2182709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085469S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6212437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6212437","articleId":"6145674","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6145679,"authors":[{"name":"Victoria Kostina","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Victoria Kostina (S'12) received the Bachelor's degree with honors in applied mathematics and physics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Russia, in 2004, where she was affiliated with the Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Ottawa, Canada, in 2006.","She is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Princeton University.

To that end, an efficient multiobjective resource allocation method is formalized and implemented. This includes a decision-making process dependent upon the environment, the current goal, the available sensors and computational resource, and the time available to make a decision.

The vibration energy induced in the mass-spring system is converted into battery charge through the dc machine and a power electronics controller. The latter is a pulse-width-modulated boost-type converter, which enforces a pseudoresistive behavior between its input terminals through a feedback control scheme developed in this study. Introducing this pseudoresistive behavior across the input terminals of the dc machine produces the same effect as a mechanical damper but with an energy-regenerative function. The dynamics of the mass-spring system coupled with the linear machine are used to obtain a condition for extracting maximum electric power from mechanical vibrations. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the performance of the regenerative damper using a small-scale suspension system test bed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Suspensions","Vibrations","DC machines","Power electronics","Resistance","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","DC machines","feedback","linear machines","machine control","permanent magnet machines","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boost-type power converter","energy-regenerative damping","mass-spring system","permanent-magnet dc machine","small-scale suspension system test bed","mechanical vibrations","linear machine","energy-regenerative function","mechanical damper","feedback control scheme","input terminals","pulse-width-modulated boost-type converter","power electronics controller","battery charge","vibration energy","electronics converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automotive electronics","energy conversion","energy harvesting","power control","vibrations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2182203","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6410053/06145685.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2182203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Boost-Type Power Converter for Energy-Regenerative Damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Boost-Type Power Converter for Energy-Regenerative Damping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145685/","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145685/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13219912","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Boost-Type Power Converter for Energy-Regenerative Damping","sourcePdf":"tmech-moallem-2182203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109771S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6410053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6410053","articleId":"6145685","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6145690,"authors":[{"name":"Xiwei Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6195043/6145690/6145690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiwei Huang received the B.Eng. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2009.

In order to increase bandwidth yet decrease power, 3-D integrated many-core memory-processor system is one of the most promising solutions. However, the increased power density and longer vertical heat-removal path in 3-D can result in thermal reliability concerns such as thermal runaway and thermal stability, which pose a significant barrier for tera-scale applications. Due to \u201cgreen-switch\u201d properties such as zero leakage current, infinite subthreshold slope, and temperature resilient behavior, nanoelectromechanical switches (NEMS) are explored in this paper to mitigate the thermal reliability issues for 3-D integrated many-core memory-processor system. The NEMS-based thermal management for 3-D integrated many-core memory-processor system is examined from device, circuit, and system levels, respectively. Moreover, one real-time thermal management is developed for improving system reliability with the use of NEMS-based thermal buffer and power gating. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively prevent the thermal runaway and also maintain high thermal stability for 3-D integrated many-core memory-processor system.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2012.2186822","startPage":"588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6195043/06145690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2012.2186822","endPage":"600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6195043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nanoelectromechanical-Switch-Based Thermal Management for 3-D Integrated Many-Core Memory-Processor System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Nanoelectromechanical-Switch-Based Thermal Management for 3-D Integrated Many-Core Memory-Processor System","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6145690/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12711829","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nanoelectromechanical-Switch-Based Thermal Management for 3-D Integrated Many-Core Memory-Processor System","sourcePdf":"tnano-yu-2186822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087498S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6195043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6195043","articleId":"6145690","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6145692,"authors":[{"name":"Julie A.

The SNN uses leaky integrate-and-fire excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons, facilitating synapses and receptive fields. Experimentally derived head-related transfer function (HRTF) acoustical data from adult domestic cats were employed to train and validate the localization ability of the architecture, training used the supervised learning algorithm called the remote supervision method to determine the azimuthal angles. The experimental results demonstrate that the architecture performs best when it is localizing high-frequency sound data in agreement with the biology, and also shows a high degree of robustness when the HRTF acoustical data is corrupted by noise.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6163421/06145692.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145692/","displayDocTitle":"Spiking Neural Network Model of Sound Localization Using the Interaural Intensity Difference","volume":"23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12571538","pubMedId":"24805041","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145692/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking Neural Network Model of Sound Localization Using the Interaural Intensity Difference","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wall-2178317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098739S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6163421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6163421","articleId":"6145692","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6145693,"authors":[{"name":"Philip T.

Efficiency is characterized and optimized based on power loss modeling and multivariable nonlinear constrained optimization over power-stage and controller parameters. A valley switching technique is adopted to reduce MOSFET turn-on switching loss in discontinuous conduction mode. An optimization procedure is formulated to minimize power loss weighted over a range of operating points, under a cost constraint. A lookup table-based digital controller is applied to achieve on-line efficiency optimization by programming switching frequencies and operating modes based on the efficiency optimization processes. The proposed on-line efficiency optimization approach is verified by experimental results on a low cost 65 W flyback dc-dc prototype.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2186590","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6184677/06145694.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6184677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2186590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"3734","endPage":"3748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency Optimization in Digitally Controlled Flyback DC\u2013DC Converters Over Wide Ranges of Operating Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency Optimization in Digitally Controlled Flyback DC\u2013DC Converters Over Wide Ranges of Operating Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145694/","volume":"27","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6145694/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12670077","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency Optimization in Digitally Controlled Flyback DC\u2013DC Converters Over Wide Ranges of Operating Conditions","sourcePdf":"tpel-kang-2186590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084063S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6184677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6184677","articleId":"6145694","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6145697,"authors":[{"name":"Xu She","affiliation":["Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) Systems Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6184677/6145697/6145697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xu She (S'08) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

It proposes a control algorithm that devotes itself not only to balancing the floating dc capacitors but also to eliminating the coupling effect between the voltage-balancing controller and the original system controller (controller without additional voltage-balancing controllers). Specifically, the average model in the d-q coordinate frame is derived and the control law is established. Then, the coupling effect between the voltage-balancing controller and the original system controller is identified and a new expression for duty cycle modification is proposed thus to eliminate the effect. Furthermore, this paper gives the design considerations of the pro- posed method, including the derivation of key transfer functions and effective voltage-balancing area, for the completeness of the discussion. Moreover, the reference generation techniques of the voltage-balancing controller are also discussed. This paper investigates the voltage imbalance in the soft-start process caused by an unsuitable reference, and presents a simple modified reference generation solution. Finally, both simulation and experimental results verify the performance of the proposed control system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145697/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","volume":"27","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12670078","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6145697/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coupling Effect Reduction of a Voltage-Balancing Controller in Single-Phase Cascaded Multilevel Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupling Effect Reduction of a Voltage-Balancing Controller in Single-Phase Cascaded Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-she-2186615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076508S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6184677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6184677","articleId":"6145697","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6145703,"authors":[{"name":"Jouya Jadidian","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/6165504/6145703/6145703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jouya Jadidian (S'06) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

However, the TensorFace model creates a difficulty in representing the nonlinearity of view subspace. In this paper, to break this limitation, we present a view-manifold-based TensorFace (V-TensorFace), in which the latent view manifold preserves the local distances in the multiview face space. Moreover, a kernelized TensorFace (K-TensorFace) for multiview face recognition is proposed to preserve the structure of the latent manifold in the image space. Both methods provide a generative model that involves a continuous view manifold for unseen view representation. Most importantly, we propose a unified framework to generalize TensorFace, V-TensorFace, and K-TensorFace. Finally, an expectation-maximization like algorithm is developed to estimate the identity and view parameters iteratively for a face image of an unknown/unseen view. The experiment on the PIE database shows the effectiveness of the manifold construction method. Extensive comparison experiments on Weizmann and Oriental Face databases for multiview face recognition demonstrate the superiority of the proposed V- and K-TensorFace methods over the view-based principal component analysis and other state-of-the-art approaches for such purpose.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6169194/06145712.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2169452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2169452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiview Face Recognition: From TensorFace to V-TensorFace and K-TensorFace","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Manifolds","Tensile stress","Face recognition","Vectors","Kernel","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","face recognition","tensors","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiview face recognition","V-TensorFace model","K-TensorFace model","tensor analysis","facial variation","view-manifold-based TensorFace","latent view manifold","multiview face space","kernelized TensorFace","expectation-maximization algorithm","PIE database","manifold construction method","Weizmann databases","oriental face databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Manifold learning","multiview face recognition","nonlinear tensor decomposition","subspace analysis","TensorFace"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometric Identification","Databases, Factual","Face","Humans","Linear Models","Nonlinear Dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiview Face Recognition: From TensorFace to V-TensorFace and K-TensorFace","volume":"42","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6145712/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12592493","pubMedId":"22318490","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiview Face Recognition: From TensorFace to V-TensorFace and K-TensorFace","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-tian-2169452-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177839S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6169194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6169194","articleId":"6145712","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145717,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Pereda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6169213/6145717/6145717-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Javier Pereda (S'09) was born in Santiago, Chile.

The reduced THD makes them useful for electric vehicle (EV) applications, but the main problem with the CHB is the large amount of isolated power sources required to feed each of the H-bridges. An improved variant known as the asymmetrical CHB (ACHB) inverter uses H-bridges of different sizes and then needs fewer isolated power sources than the CHB. However, in battery-powered EVs, only one power supply (fuel cell or battery pack) is desirable. This work presents a solution to solve the problem, operating some of the small H-bridges (Aux-bridges) as series active filters and using a small high-frequency link (HFL). With this solution, only one dc source is required to feed the inverter, and if the control is adjusted to work at particular switching points, more than 98% of power is transferred through the larger H-bridges (MAIN bridges). The proposed ACHB topology can produce any number of levels, and the M AIN bridges always commutate at fundamental frequency. As the number of levels must remain constant for all output voltages, a variable dc source is required to control the amplitude of the motor voltage. This work shows some simulations and experiments on a 2-kW 27-level ACHB working with only 23 levels. The concept is being implemented in a small EV with an ACHB drive of 18 kW.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"23-Level Inverter for Electric Vehicles Using a Single Battery Pack and Series Active Filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2186599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6169213/06145717.pdf","startPage":"1043","endPage":"1051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2186599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"23-Level Inverter for Electric Vehicles Using a Single Battery Pack and Series Active Filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6145717/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592453","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"23-Level Inverter for Electric Vehicles Using a Single Battery Pack and Series Active Filters","sourcePdf":"tvt-dixon-2186599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193365S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6169213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6169213","articleId":"6145717","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145720,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeyoon Lee","affiliation":["SMEs Cooperation Team, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086624464"},{"name":"Dongweon Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dongweon","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37266960200"},{"name":"Kyongkuk Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyongkuk","lastName":"Cho","id":"37291748400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6145720","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":908},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Fading","AWGN channels","Error probability","Quadrature amplitude modulation","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","fading channels","Gaussian distribution","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-ary \u03b8-QAM","error performance analysis","symbol error rate","bit error rate","quadrature amplitude modulation","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channels","fading channels","optimum angle","2D Gaussian Q-function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","symbol error rate (SER)","$\\theta$-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we derive new exact and general expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER) of M-ary \u03b8-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for M = 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">l</sup>\n , I \u2265 4, based on not only square-QAM (SQAM) for M = 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2l</sup>\n, I \u2265 2 but cross-QAM (CQAM) as well, for M = 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2l</sup>\n+1, I \u2265 2 in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and various fading channels; we also present the optimum angle and constellation of M-ary \u03b8-QAM.

Second, memories are accessed in small chunks, thus leaving the vast majority of the memory cells unaccessed for a large fraction of the time. In this paper, we present an overview of the techniques proposed both in the academic and in the industrial domain for minimizing leakage power, and in particular, the subthreshold component, in SRAMs. The surveyed solutions range from cell-level techniques to architectural solutions suitable to system-level design.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6287055/06145723.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2185303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2185303","startPage":"1992","endPage":"2007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Techniques and Architectures for Low-Leakage SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145723/","displayDocTitle":"Design Techniques and Architectures for Low-Leakage SRAMs","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145723/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"12961041","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Techniques and Architectures for Low-Leakage SRAMs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-macii-2185303-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125566S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6287055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6287055","articleId":"6145723","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6145725,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The proposed control method limits the energy storage depth of discharge in order to meet a more than ten-year cycle life.

However, based on the current tree-based architecture, existing OFDM PON systems face severe challenges when increasing the scalability and data-rate performance. In this paper, we propose a high-performance virtual-tree orthogonal frequency-division multiple access PON system (VTOPS). With the virtual-tree architecture and coupled with the use of inexpensive direct modulation, VTOPS features high reliability, scalability, spectrum efficiency, and cost effectiveness all at once. For governing the flexible/fair access and dynamic allocation of bandwidth, VTOPS incorporates a rate-based medium access control (MAC) scheme. The MAC scheme performs dynamic rate adjustment using a neural-fuzzy system. By adjusting the system parameters, the MAC scheme can achieve a wide range of delay and fairness performance under a variety of traffic patterns. Finally, we show both theoretical and experimental results to demonstrate that, by applying the power pre-emphasis algorithm and adaptive subchannel modulation, VTOPS achieves 40 Gb/s downlink and 40 Gb/s uplink transmissions, using low-cost 10 GHz directly modulated lasers.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2186954","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6177715/06145729.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2186954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177715","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Performance OFDMA PON System Architecture and Medium Access Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High-Performance OFDMA PON System Architecture and Medium Access Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","publicationDate":"June1, 2012","accessionNumber":"12638620","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6145729/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Performance OFDMA PON System Architecture and Medium Access Control","sourcePdf":"jlt-yuang-2186954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081228S","chronDate":"June1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6177715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6177715","articleId":"6145729","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145735,"authors":[{"name":"Fukun Bi","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fukun","lastName":"Bi","id":"37545335600"},{"name":"Bocheng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bocheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37291963600"},{"name":"Lining Gao","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lining","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289060300"},{"name":"Mingming Bian","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingming","lastName":"Bian","id":"37605679900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6145735","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1354},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Computational modeling","Visualization","Context","Satellites","Optical imaging","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","feature extraction","geophysical image processing","object detection","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual search inspired computational model","optical satellite images","automatic ship detection","salient candidate region selection","bottom-up visual attention mechanism","top-down cues","appearance analysis","neighborhood similarity-based method","local context interactions","approximation method","computational resource distribution","panchromatic SPOT5 data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Appearance analysis","context","remote sensing image","ship detection","visual search"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel computational model for automatic ship detection in optical satellite images.

Specifically, in addition to the detailed appearance analysis of candidates, a neighborhood similarity-based method is further exploited to characterize their local context interactions. Furthermore, the framework of our model is designed in a multiscale and hierarchical manner which provides a plausible approximation to a visual search process and reasonably distributes the computational resources.

Representative polarimetric parameters were calculated from full-polarimetric data for urban areas, where most of the buildings were destroyed by the subsequent tsunami, in order to identify the radar scattering mechanism in these areas. These parameters were compared with the ones observed before the disaster. The full-polarimetric data analysis shows that the affected areas were represented by surface scattering with high entropy, indicating that a complex scattering mechanism with nonreflection symmetry is involved. The coherence between HH and VV and that between RR and LL are the most important factors in distinguishing the disaster areas from the data. Alpha angle and anisotropy are also important factors in this respect; however, anisotropy derived from PiSAR data does not show the difference between areas with collapsed and still-standing buildings. This may be because the azimuth slope angle for the target urban area is different before and after the disaster for both PALSAR and PiSAR data. Owing to the double-bounce scattering from azimuthally rotated targets in the urban areas, the power estimated from the four-component decomposition model is distributed within a wide range not only for double-bounce scattering but also for volume and surface scatterings. Additionally, the model does not show a systematic change between before and after the disaster, and \u03c3\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sup>\n for four polarizations with 30-m resolution does not show a systematic difference.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2182030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6163264/06145738.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2182030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Urban Areas Affected by the 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami With L-Band SAR Full-Polarimetric Mode","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145738/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Urban Areas Affected by the 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami With L-Band SAR Full-Polarimetric Mode","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12575048","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6145738/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Urban Areas Affected by the 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami With L-Band SAR Full-Polarimetric Mode","sourcePdf":"lgrs-watanabe-2182030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055389S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6163264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6163264","articleId":"6145738","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145743,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Giacobello","affiliation":["CTO, Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6157682/6145743/6145743-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniele Giacobello (S'06\u2013M'10) was born in Milan, Italy, in 1981.

These tools have shown to be effective in several issues related to modeling and coding of speech signals. For speech analysis, we provide predictors that are accurate in modeling the speech production process and overcome problems related to traditional linear prediction. In particular, the predictors obtained offer a more effective decoupling of the vocal tract transfer function and its underlying excitation, making it a very efficient method for the analysis of voiced speech. For speech coding, we provide predictors that shape the residual according to the characteristics of the sparse encoding techniques resulting in more straightforward coding strategies. Furthermore, encouraged by the promising application of compressed sensing in signal compression, we investigate its formulation and application to sparse linear predictive coding. The proposed estimators are all solutions to convex optimization problems, which can be solved efficiently and reliably using, e.g., interior-point methods. Extensive experimental results are provided to support the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing the improvements over traditional linear prediction in both speech analysis and coding.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6157682/06145743.pdf","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2012.2186807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2186807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Linear Prediction and Its Applications to Speech Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Minimization","Predictive models","Vectors","Prediction algorithms","Speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","convex programming","data compression","linear codes","speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse linear prediction","speech processing","sparsity constraints","speech coding","speech production process","sparse encoding techniques","signal compression","compressed sensing","sparse linear predictive coding","convex optimization problems","interior-point methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1-norm minimization","compressed sensing","linear prediction","sparse representation","speech analysis","speech coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Linear Prediction and Its Applications to Speech Processing","volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6145743/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12637632","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Linear Prediction and Its Applications to Speech Processing","sourcePdf":"tasl-giacobello-2186807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104015S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6157682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6157682","articleId":"6145743","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145744,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojia Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6157682/6145744/6145744-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojia Zhao (S'11) received the B.E. degree in software engineering from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2008.

Inspired by auditory perception, computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) typically segregates speech by producing a binary time-frequency mask. We investigate CASA for robust speaker identification. We first introduce a novel speaker feature, gammatone frequency cepstral coefficient (GFCC), based on an auditory periphery model, and show that this feature captures speaker characteristics and performs substantially better than conventional speaker features under noisy conditions. To deal with noisy speech, we apply CASA separation and then either reconstruct or marginalize corrupted components indicated by a CASA mask. We find that both reconstruction and marginalization are effective. We further combine the two methods into a single system based on their complementary advantages, and this system achieves significant performance improvements over related systems under a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2012.2186803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6157682/06145744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2186803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157682","startPage":"1608","endPage":"1616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CASA-Based Robust Speaker Identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CASA-Based Robust Speaker Identification","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12614490","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6145744/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CASA-Based Robust Speaker Identification","sourcePdf":"tasl-zhao-2186803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.219401S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6157682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6157682","articleId":"6145744","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145745,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Huy Nguyen","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/6152302/6145745/6145745-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vu Huy Nguyen (S\u201905) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2011.","He is currently a lecturer and researcher at University of Transport and Communications, Hanoi, Vietnam.

A six-coil single-moving-part platen moves over a superimposed concentrated-field permanent-magnet matrix. With a rectangular coil placed in the magnetic field generated by the superimposed concentrated-field magnet matrix, the force acting on the coil is calculated by volume integration based on the Lorentz force law. The distance between the long sides and that between the short sides of a rectangular coil are designed to be a half pitch and one pitch of the magnet matrix, respectively. This allows for the simplification of force generation and calculation, compact size, and light mass (0.64 kg) of the moving platen. Six coils are divided into three two-phase linear-motor armatures with 270\u00b0 or 450\u00b0 phase differences. The complete force-current relation for the entire platen with the six coils is derived. Experimental results are presented to verify the working principle of the positioner designed in this paper. The positioner can be employed for the stepping and scanning applications that require 3-DOF planar motions with long travel ranges in two horizontal directions and small rotational motions about the vertical axis.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/6152302/06145745.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Electromagnetic Design for a Precision Planar Positioner Moving Over a Superimposed Concentrated-Field Magnet Matrix","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2011.2170173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6152302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2011.2170173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Novel Electromagnetic Design for a Precision Planar Positioner Moving Over a Superimposed Concentrated-Field Magnet Matrix","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537577","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6145745/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Electromagnetic Design for a Precision Planar Positioner Moving Over a Superimposed Concentrated-Field Magnet Matrix","sourcePdf":"tec-kim-2170173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055368S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6152302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6152302","articleId":"6145745","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145746,"authors":[{"name":"Tung-Ming Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6172314/6145746/6145746-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tung-Ming Pan was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1970.

The BRS scheme achieves an excellent balance between quality-of-service (QoS) requirement guarantee and system throughput enhancement, whereas conventional schemes cannot explicitly and accurately control this tradeoff. Based on the adaptive priority threshold of each user, the BRS scheme first performs a priority-based resource allocation (RA) algorithm for users whose priority value is larger than its priority threshold to fulfill the QoS requirement. The BRS scheme then performs a channel-state-information (CSI)-based RA algorithm for the remaining users to enhance system throughput. To achieve balance between QoS guarantee and throughput enhancement, a fuzzy inference priority threshold generator adaptively and intelligently adjusts the priority threshold of each user. Simulation results show that the proposed BRS scheme with adaptive priority threshold enhances the system throughput by 16%, 8.5%, 8.2%, and 46.8% at traffic load of 0.93, compared with conventional adaptive radio RA (RRA), utility-based RRA, utility-based throughput maximization and complexity reduction scheduling, and fairness and QoS guarantee scheduling with fuzzy controls schemes, respectively, under a QoS requirement guarantee. This approach also outperforms the BRS scheme with fixed priority thresholds in both throughput enhancement and QoS guarantee.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2186832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6169213/06145761.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2186832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169213","startPage":"1276","endPage":"1286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Balanced Resource Scheduling Scheme With Adaptive Priority Thresholds for OFDMA Downlink Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6145761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Balanced Resource Scheduling Scheme With Adaptive Priority Thresholds for OFDMA Downlink Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6145761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592457","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6145761/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Balanced Resource Scheduling Scheme With Adaptive Priority Thresholds for OFDMA Downlink Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-chang-2186832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090414S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6169213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6169213","articleId":"6145761","onlineDate":"03 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6145762,"authors":[{"name":"Taesang Cho","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taesang","lastName":"Cho","id":"37721528900"},{"name":"Hanho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hanho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280126500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6145762","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2245},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless personal area networks","Hardware","Complexity theory","Computer architecture","Throughput","OFDM","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","fast Fourier transforms","personal area networks","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed low-complexity modified radix-25","FFT processor","WPAN applications","fast Fourier transform","twiddle factor memory","signal-to-quantization noise ratio","CMOS technology","word length 12 bit","size 90 nm","voltage 1.2 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier transform (FFT)","modified ${\\rm radix}-2^{5}$","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","wireless personal area network (WPAN)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a high-speed low-complexity modified radix-2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\n 512-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor using an eight data-path pipelined approach for high rate wireless personal area network applications.

This paper presents the joint scheme of CFO) and channel estimation in the MIMO-OFDM systems with the minimum error probability based precoder for reducing PAPR. First, a minimum error probability based precoding matrix to reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals is designed. The CFO and CIR estimators based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with an iterative scheme are developed to execute the estimations. To reduce computational complexity, a simpler coarse CFO estimator is carried out before the fine estimation so that a more accurate and faster convergent estimate can be attained. Simulation results show that the CFO estimator with a coarse initial estimate not only has an excellent performance at reduced computational complexity, but also makes the CIR estimation achieve almost ideal performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146063","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint estimation of frequency offset and channel parameters for MIMO-OFDM systems with PAPR reduction precoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint estimation of frequency offset and channel parameters for MIMO-OFDM systems with PAPR reduction precoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146063/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539546","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146063/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint estimation of frequency offset and channel parameters for MIMO-OFDM systems with PAPR reduction precoder","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053213S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146064,"authors":[{"name":"Richa Siddavaatam","affiliation":["WINCORE Lab, Ryerson Unviersity, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Richa","lastName":"Siddavaatam","id":"37085981849"},{"name":"Alagan Anpalagan","affiliation":["WINCORE Lab, Ryerson Unviersity, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Alagan","lastName":"Anpalagan","id":"37270506600"},{"name":"Matt Tharma","affiliation":["PESIPlex Inc., Brampton, Canada"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Tharma","id":"38233095100"},{"name":"Jeeva Nadaraj","affiliation":["PESIPlex Inc., Brampton, Canada"],"firstName":"Jeeva","lastName":"Nadaraj","id":"38233096100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146064","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Resource management","Interference","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference mitigation","femtocell CDMA networks","time reuse partitioning","two-tier network","macrocellular networks","multifemtocell networks","indoor coverage","high-speed backhaul network","short-range radiocommunication","cross-tier interference","interfemtocell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Time reuse partitioning","Interference avoidance","Transmission coordination"]}],"abstract":"A two-tier network composed of conventional macrocellular networks and emerging multi-femtocell networks offers extended indoor coverage and higher data rates while off oading the traffic through high speed backhaul network.

In this paper, we propose to use time reuse portioning to mitigate downlink inter-femtocell interference as well as cross tier interference and the present results to show performance improvement by employing the time reuse partitioning in CDMA networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146064","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146064.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference mitigation in femtocell CDMA networks through time reuse partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation in femtocell CDMA networks through time reuse partitioning","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146064/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539547","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146064/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation in femtocell CDMA networks through time reuse partitioning","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0863S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6146071,"authors":[{"name":"Shiunn-Jang Chern","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shiunn-Jang Chern","id":"37339011400"},{"name":"You-De Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Vat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"You-De Lee","id":"38240887900"},{"name":"Richard Hsin-Hsyong Yang","affiliation":["Department of computer and communication, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Richard Hsin-Hsyong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37420810200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146071","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"This paper presents a new transceiver framework of the MIMO-OFDM systems, with the space-time block code (ST-BC). Unlike the conventional Pseudo-Random Postfix (PRP) - OFDM in our proposed framework the null samples of zero-padding (ZP)-OFDM is replaced by known cyclic postfix sequence (CPS), weighted by a pseudo-random (PR) scalar. Since the CPS is implemented by the cyclic-shift (CS) complementary code (CC) sequences, the proposed transceiver scheme is referred to as the MIMO CS-PRP-OFDM systems. By exploring the useful property of CC sequences, convolved with channel information, the receiver design associated with the semi-blind channel estimation of the proposed MIMO CS-PRP-OFDM systems is affected only by the background noise. It avoids the interference of the transmitted signals, and yields achieving better system performance, in terms of symbol error rate, compared with the conventional PRP-OFDM based systems, with less complexity. This is especially true when the signal-to-noise ratio is increased.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146071.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the MIMO CS-PRP-OFDM systems with complementary codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Receivers","Manganese"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cyclic codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio transceivers","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO CS-PRP-OFDM systems","complementary codes","transceiver","space-time block code","ST-BC","pseudo-random postfix","zero-padding-OFDM","pseudo-random scalar","cyclic-shift complementary code","channel information","semi-blind channel estimation","interference","symbol error rate","signal-to-noise ratio","multiple-input multiple-output systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","space-time encoder","redundant sequence","complementary codes","cyclic-postfix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the MIMO CS-PRP-OFDM systems with complementary codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146071/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539552","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the MIMO CS-PRP-OFDM systems with complementary codes","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066579S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146077,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Sasaki","affiliation":["Tottori University Electronic Display Research Center, Tottori, Japan","Sharp Corporation, Display Device Development Group, Taki, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"38023934300"},{"name":"Kentaro Kinoshita","affiliation":["Tottori University Electronic Display Research Center, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Kentaro","lastName":"Kinoshita","id":"37932981400"},{"name":"Satoru Kishida","affiliation":["Tottori University Electronic Display Research Center, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Kishida","id":"37282527000"},{"name":"Yoshiharu Hirata","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Tottori University Hospital, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiharu","lastName":"Hirata","id":"37592633800"},{"name":"Seigo Yamada","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Tottori University Hospital, Yonago, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Seigo","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37591751900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146077","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Computers","Cancer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic radiography","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance system construction","neural networks","abnormal area detection","chest X-ray images","one-dimensional numeric sequences","differential filters","pixel values","1st-order differential coefficients","2nd-order differential coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Chest X-ray image","Medical diagnosis support","Pre-processing","One-dimensional numeric sequence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146077","abstract":"We constructed systems with neural networks using one-dimensional numeric sequences from chest X-ray images for detection of abnormal areas and investigated the effect of pre-processing for input patterns on performance of the systems.

The SOM based color quantization system is designed by using VHDL and its feasibility is verified by the VHDL simulations. The hardware SOM used for the system includes a neighborhood function by using simple circuit. Since the search for the winning neuron and the weight updates are performed in parallel, it can process each vector element (RGB data) within a single clock cycle.

From the simulation results, we show that the energy consumption of the proposed circuit is lower than that of conventional SRAM.","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146088.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power adiabatic SRAM","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-power adiabatic SRAM","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6146088/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power adiabatic SRAM","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048429S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6146095,"authors":[{"name":"Ziji Ma","affiliation":["Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China","Graduate School of Infonnation Science, NAIST, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"lastName":"Ziji Ma","id":"37853445500"},{"name":"Tomonori Sato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Infonnation Science, NAIST, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomonori","lastName":"Sato","id":"38239296100"},{"name":"Minoru Okada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Infonnation Science, NAIST, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Okada","id":"37280788100"},{"name":"Hideki Furudate","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kanagawa, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Furudate","id":"38233215300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146095","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"abstract":"The time-varying multipath fading causes the intercarrier interference (ICI) that destroys the orthogonality between the subcarriers for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

The voltage level controller then feedbacks corresponding voltage level to modulate pulse width of control signal in buck converter and adjust supplying current and power delivery. The proposed sliding-switching technique stabilizes the voltage variation of power supply under the situation of alternating light and heavy loading and consequently enhances the performance of total-harmonic-distortion (THD).

To solve this issue, we propose dynamic MIMO detection using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The proposed detection computes the weight matrix across multiple packets.

Previous works apply the low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes to improve the system performance and the write margin. However, LDPC codes are not designed for the write error channel (WEC). Therefore, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) is modified at the LDPC decoder by incorporating the information write error probability (p) for the performance improvement. In practice, such probability is not precisely known, therefore, in this work, we investigate the effects of the mismatch of expected write error probability and the actual one in the BPM system. The results show that the performance of LDPC decoding is worse when p mismatches with the write error probability of the WEC.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146112","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146112.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC decoder with modified LLR for bit patterned media with write errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146112/","displayDocTitle":"LDPC decoder with modified LLR for bit patterned media with write errors","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146112/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539591","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC decoder with modified LLR for bit patterned media with write errors","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043253S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6146113,"authors":[{"name":"Takaya Kaji","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Science Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaya","lastName":"Kaji","id":"38227980400"},{"name":"Shingo Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Science Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37270688500"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Miyanaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Science Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Miyanaga","id":"37270680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146113","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","interference suppression","logic gates","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","singular value decomposition","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIP-based singular value decomposition processor","SVD-MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems","beamforming","signal interference suppression","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","floating-point units","design flexibility","high-precision computation","QR method iterations","MIMO channel matrix","logic gates","complex-valued matrix"]}],"abstract":"In Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless systems, singular value decomposition (SVD) is used for a beamforming in SVD-MIMO systems.

Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technique becomes an interesting option for CR networks because it can increase the spectrum efficiency and maintain the diversity benefits. In fact, there are two schemes of MIMO transmission including Spatial-Multiplexing (SM) and Space-time block coding (STBC) schemes. These schemes provide the different benefits according to the channel quality or user requirements. Therefore, base station or fusion center must have the capability of detecting both SM and STBC from each CR user at the same time. In this paper, the novel Hybrid-MIMO receiver has been proposed by merging the detection methods of both SM and STBC schemes. The simulation results confirm that the proposed system can improve the symbol error rate and still maintain the benefits of diversity.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146124","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146124.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid-MIMO receiver with both space-time coding and Spatial Multiplexing detections for Cognitive Radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid-MIMO receiver with both space-time coding and Spatial Multiplexing detections for Cognitive Radio networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146124/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539603","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146124/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid-MIMO receiver with both space-time coding and Spatial Multiplexing detections for Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043145S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146135,"authors":[{"name":"Shuoxin Ma","affiliation":["School of information science and engineering, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Shuoxin Ma","id":"38240072400"},{"name":"Junning Jiang","affiliation":["School of information science and engineering, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Junning Jiang","id":"38239366600"},{"name":"Qiao Meng","affiliation":["School of information science and engineering, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Qiao Meng","id":"37592037500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146135","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","frequency modulation","maximum likelihood estimation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency joint estimation","frequency rate estimation","linear frequency modulated signal","maximum-likelihood estimation method","instantaneous frequency rate","low signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chirp","frequency estimation","frequency rate","maximum likelihood","signal processing"]}],"abstract":"Frequency and frequency rate estimation of linear frequency modulated (FM) signal has been playing important role in applications various engineering fields.

Injected fuel flow leads to an accurate measurement of car's fuel consumption. The fuel consumption of a car depends on many factors like road, weather, and driver behaviour that are rigid for a car manufacturer to influence.

Pilot symbols are used to gather knowledge about the channel and try to estimate it. The channel estimation based on the pilot symbol is called pilot aided channel estimation. In this research, Least Square (LS) method was chosen for initial channel estimation. By using applicable proposed system design, channel state information is estimated through the use of channel information before in subcarriers with no pilot symbols. Zero forcing (ZF) algorithm is used to detect and separate the received signal. The result shows that channel estimation would be better by increasing SNR.

This paper proposes an integrated data compression and anomaly detection algorithm in WSNs which can detect anomalies accurately by employing half of sensor data measurement, instead of using all the sensor data measurement. The contribution of this paper centers on data compression by using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) then feeding to anomaly detection by using One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). We tested our algorithm with several synthetic and real world datasets.

Therefore, this paper presents the average BLER performance using decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE) for a low-rate turbo code in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).

Channel estimation accuracy using a reference signal (RS) becomes a bottleneck to achieving a high diversity gain from SORTD under the highly channel-loaded conditions. This is because the inter-code interference due to frequency selectivity deteriorates the channel estimation accuracy particularly in a longer delay spread channel.

The evaluation results show that non-orthogonal access with a SIC significantly enhances the cell-edge user throughput (thus user fairness) compared to orthogonal access while achieving the same total user throughput in the context of the cellular downlink, which can yield some insights regarding the direction of the wireless access scheme for the systems beyond IMT-Advanced.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146188","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146188.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-orthogonal access with SIC in cellular downlink for user fairness enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146188/","displayDocTitle":"Non-orthogonal access with SIC in cellular downlink for user fairness enhancement","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539665","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146188/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-orthogonal access with SIC in cellular downlink for user fairness enhancement","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083805S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6146189,"authors":[{"name":"Yohei Umeda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Umeda","id":"38242638000"},{"name":"Kenichi Higuchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Higuchi","id":"37269866000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146189","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bismuth","Blogs","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient adaptive frequency partitioning","OFDMA downlink","fractional frequency reuse","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","FFR method","cell-interior edge users"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates an adaptive frequency and transmission power partitioning method between cell-interior and cell-edge users in the downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) with fractional frequency reuse (FFR).

In this paper, we step away from comparing their performance and complexity and focus instead on the selection of GA parameters, such as population size, P, generation number G, and mutation probability, p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n, for the GA in MIMO detection.

The empirical distributions of the selected parameter values are then compared for various channel fading assumptions. It is found that the optimum GA parameter values for MIMO detection are directly affected by fading type, AS and K distribution, and especially by the rank of the channel matrix mean. The meta-GA approach helps reveal that the parameters of the inner GA should be tuned in order to achieve maximum performance for the lowest numerical complexity. Future work will seek efficient methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146190.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fading effects on parameter selection in genetic algorithm for MIMO detection","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading effects","parameter selection","genetic algorithm","MIMO detection","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication systems","spatial multiplexing","GA-based detection","maximum-likelihood detection","ML detection","linear detection","channel fading assumptions","Rayleigh fading","Rician fading","fixed azimuth spread","random azimuth spread","Rician K- factor","channel matrix mean","optimum GA parameter values","meta-GA approach","numerical complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Azimuth spread","fading","genetic algorithm","K-factor","maximum likelihood","MIMO","WINNER II"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fading effects on parameter selection in genetic algorithm for MIMO detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146190/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539667","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fading effects on parameter selection in genetic algorithm for MIMO detection","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059446S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146193,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsien Hsia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hsien","lastName":"Hsia","id":"37271479000"},{"name":"Tsung-Cheng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsung-Cheng Wu","id":"37087455437"},{"name":"Jen-Shiun Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Shiun","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37271474300"},{"name":"Chi-Fang Hsieh","firstName":"Chi-Fang","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"38238218200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146193","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"abstract":"This work presents a new model based on least-mean-square (LMS) scheme to train the mask operation on low resolution images.

However, the scheme of moving objects detection and tracking in a real surrounding environment is a difficult task due to noise issues such as fake motion or noise. The ALMSS approach can effectively reduce the noise with low computing cost in both fake motion and noise environments. In the experiments on real scenes indicate that the proposed ALMSS method is effective for moving objects detection and tracking in real-time.

In video transcoding different frames require different computational power hence inefficient video segmentation will lead towards lower performance.

Thus we adapt a simply-adjusted DVB-T2 system as one application of MIMO system and provide its computer simulation results comparing the performance of conventional DVB-T2 to MIMO DVB-T2.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the DVB-T2 system with MIMO Spatial Multiplexing","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146201","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146201.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the DVB-T2 system with MIMO Spatial Multiplexing","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146201/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539676","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the DVB-T2 system with MIMO Spatial Multiplexing","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05617S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6146206,"authors":[{"name":"Ukrit Marung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand"],"firstName":"Ukrit","lastName":"Marung","id":"38290102200"},{"name":"Nipon Theera-Umpon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand"],"firstName":"Nipon","lastName":"Theera-Umpon","id":"38277096700"},{"name":"Sansanee Auephanwiriyakul","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sansanee","lastName":"Auephanwiriyakul","id":"37324253900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2166-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2165-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2164-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146206","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image processing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual clustering method","information retrieval","data mining","machine learning","image analysis","image manipulation","genetic algorithm","synthetic data sets","binary image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clustering method","visual clustering","data clustering","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146206","abstract":"Clustering method has been applied in many fields, including data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, and image analysis.

There exist idle durations, also referred to as white spaces, in many licensed bands which could be taken advantage of by a WMN for better spectral efficiency. Use of cognitive radio in a WMN would enable Mesh Routers (MRs) that experience bad channel conditions, to shift operation to a licensed spectrum. This opportunistic sharing of white spaces results in higher spectral efficiency as well as reduced traffic volume in the ISM band. Recent research only considers using omni-directional antenna at each Mesh Client (MC). This can be inefficient, especially in case of a Cognitive WMN (CWMN) when it shifts operation to the licensed band and imposes inadmissible interference on licensed users. We study the performance improvement of a CWMN by employing smart antenna in each MC. In other words, our proposed architectural design with spatial selectivity encourages load sharing among numerous MRs in the ISM band, as well as increases throughput. Through extensive simulations, our research work analyzes the interference caused to licensed users while using omni-directional antenna. Finally, we compare scenarios where each MC in a WMN is equipped with omni-directional, directional, and smart antenna.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146213","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146213.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146213","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Wireless Mesh Network performance using cognitive radio with smart antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Wireless Mesh Network performance using cognitive radio with smart antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146213/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146213/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539688","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Wireless Mesh Network performance using cognitive radio with smart antennas","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06274S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6146214,"authors":[{"name":"Sudharman K.

In particular, we describe an architecture for optimizing the overall performance of vehicular dynamic spectrum access (VDSA) networks. Due to the high level of mobility for vehicles operating under highway conditions, coupled with spatially variant spectrum allocation across a large geographical region, we envision that future vehicular communications will employ a form of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in order to facilitate wireless transmissions between vehicles and with roadside infrastructure. Moreover, the VDSA concept will be realized via a combination of software-defined radio (SDR) technology, spectral occupancy databases, and machine learning techniques for enabling network automation. A vehicular networking scenario possesses the potential to be substantially different relative to a generic mobile scenario with respect to the particular type of mobility involved, the predictable trajectories of the vehicular traffic, and the overall scale of the network range. Consequently, this architecture is designed to enable VDSA in a more flexible wireless spectrum environment by leveraging the cognitive radio concept and existing wireless spectrum databases actively being developed while simultaneously being compatible with current spectrum regulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146215","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138394/6146047/06146215.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146215","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning in vehicular dynamic spectrum access networks: Opportunities and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning in vehicular dynamic spectrum access networks: Opportunities and challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146215/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12539690","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning in vehicular dynamic spectrum access networks: Opportunities and challenges","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PID323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070401S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138394","isNumber":"6146047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138394","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6146047","articleId":"6146215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6146216,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The PA incorporates a parallel combination of four differential PA cores to generate high output power with good efficiency and linearity.

This new type of power recycling scheme is essentially inspired by a ring-resonator. By forming a closed-loop on the drain side LWA of the DA, we create the ring-resonator that is actively coupled by the DA from the gate line and hence can obtain a substantial gain enhancement compared to the one directly terminated without the loop. Such enhancement fluctuates with respect to the frequency. At the resonant frequencies of the closed-loop ring-resonator, the enhancement reaches a maximum. The phenomenon will be explained and derived theoretically in detail, and then validated through the real implementation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recycling","Logic gates","Couplings","Leaky wave antennas","Resonant frequency","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed amplifiers","leaky wave antennas","metamaterials","power amplifiers","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ring-resonator-inspired power recycling scheme","gain-enhanced distributed amplifier","CRLH-transmission line leaky wave antennas","composite-right/left handed transmission line","closed-loop ring-resonator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active antenna","composite right/left handed transmission lines (CRLH-TLs)","distributed amplifiers (DAs)","leaky wave antennas (LWAs)","power recycling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2183610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6176247/06146386.pdf","startPage":"1027","endPage":"1037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6176247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2183610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ring-Resonator-Inspired Power Recycling Scheme for Gain-Enhanced Distributed Amplifier-Based CRLH-Transmission Line Leaky Wave Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ring-Resonator-Inspired Power Recycling Scheme for Gain-Enhanced Distributed Amplifier-Based CRLH-Transmission Line Leaky Wave Antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146386/","volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146386/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12638282","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ring-Resonator-Inspired Power Recycling Scheme for Gain-Enhanced Distributed Amplifier-Based CRLH-Transmission Line Leaky Wave Antennas","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wu-2183610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053776S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6176247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6176247","articleId":"6146386","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6146410,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Khosravi","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong Campus at Waurn Ponds, Geelong, Victoria, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6243218/6146410/6146410-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abbas Khosravi (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia, in 2010.","Currently, he is a research fellow in the Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR) at Deakin University.

It is the communication architecture that determines the collaboration efficiency on the hardware side. Optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) are emerging communication architectures that can potentially offer ultra-high communication bandwidth and low latency to multiprocessor systems. Thermal sensitivity is an intrinsic characteristic of photonic devices used by ONoCs as well as a potential issue. This paper systematically modeled and quantitatively analyzed the thermal effects in ONoCs. We used an 8 \u00d7 8 mesh-based ONoC as a case study and evaluated the impacts of thermal effects in the average power efficiency for real MPSoC applications. We revealed three important factors regarding ONoC power efficiency under temperature variations, and proposed several techniques to reduce the temperature sensitivity of ONoCs. These techniques include the optimal initial setting of microresonator resonant wavelength, increasing the 3-dB bandwidth of optical switching elements by parallel coupling multiple microresonators, and the use of passive-routing optical router Crux to minimize the number of switching stages in mesh-based ONoCs. We gave a mathematical analysis of periodically parallel coupling of multiple microresonators and show that the 3-dB bandwidth of optical switching elements can be widened nearly linearly with the ring number. Evaluation results for different real MPSoC applications show that, on the basis of thermal tuning, the optimal device setting improves the average power efficiency by 54% to 1.2 pJ/bit when chip temperature reaches 85 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\nC.

As technology scales, radiation particles that create soft errors are more likely to affect more than 1 b when they impact a memory or electronic circuit. This effect is known as a multiple cell upset (MCU), and the registers or memory cells affected by an MCU are physically close. To avoid an MCU from causing more than one error in a given word, interleaving is commonly used in memories. With interleaving, cells that belong to the same logical word are placed apart such that an MCU affects multiple bits but on different words. However, interleaving increases the complexity of the memory device and is not suitable for small memories or content-addressable memories. When interleaving is not used, MCUs can cause multiple errors in a word that may not even be detected by a Hamming code. In this paper, a technique to increase the probability of detecting double and triple adjacent errors when Hamming codes are used is presented. The enhanced detection is achieved by placing the bits of the word such that adjacent errors result in a syndrome that does not match that of any single error. Double and triple adjacent errors are precisely the types of errors that an MCU would likely cause, and therefore, the proposed scheme will be useful to provide error detection for MCUs in memory designs.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2012.2186965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2012.2186965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/6210435/06146416.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Detection of Double and Triple Adjacent Errors in Hamming Codes Through Selective Bit Placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Detection of Double and Triple Adjacent Errors in Hamming Codes Through Selective Bit Placement","volume":"12","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12769140","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146416/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Detection of Double and Triple Adjacent Errors in Hamming Codes Through Selective Bit Placement","sourcePdf":"tdmr-sanchezmacian-2186965-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102317S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"6210435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6210435","articleId":"6146416","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6146418,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Rachidi","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6266739/6146418/6146418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farhad Rachidi (M'93\u2013SM'02\u2013F'10) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1986 and 1991, respectively.","He was with the Power Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology until 1996.

We start with the derivation of the general field-to-TL coupling equations for the case of a single-wire line above a perfectly conducting ground. The derived equations are solely based on the thin-wire approximation and they do take into account high-frequency radiation effects. Under the TL approximation, the general equations reduce to the Agrawal et al. field-to-TL coupling equations. After a short discussion on the underlying assumptions of the TL theory, three seemingly different but completely equivalent approaches that have been proposed to describe the coupling of electromagnetic fields to TLs are presented. The derived equations are then extended to deal with the presence of losses and multiple conductors and expressions for the line parameters, including the ground impedance and admittance, are presented. The time-domain representation of the field-to-TL coupling equations, which allows for a straightforward treatment of nonlinear phenomena as well as the variation in the line topology, is also described. Solution methods in the frequency domain and in the time domain are given and application examples with reference to lightning-induced voltages are presented and discussed. Specifically, the effects of ground losses and corona are illustrated and discussed. When the traveling voltage and current waves are originated from lumped excitation sources located at a specific location along a TL (direct lightning strike), both the corona phenomenon and ground losses result, in general, in an attenuation and dispersion of propagating surges along TLs. However, when distributed sources representing the action of the electromagnetic field from a nearby lightning illuminating the line are present, ground losses and corona phenomenon could result in important enhancement of the induced voltage magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2011.2181519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/6266739/06146418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2011.2181519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266739","startPage":"898","endPage":"911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Field-to-Transmission Line Coupling Models With Special Emphasis to Lightning-Induced Voltages on Overhead Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Field-to-Transmission Line Coupling Models With Special Emphasis to Lightning-Induced Voltages on Overhead Lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13101085","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146418/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Field-to-Transmission Line Coupling Models With Special Emphasis to Lightning-Induced Voltages on Overhead Lines","sourcePdf":"temc-rachidi-2181519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125859S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6266739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6266739","articleId":"6146418","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6146421,"authors":[{"name":"Pascale C.

The main objective of this campaign was to collect data to support the Phase A of the 7th Earth Explorer candidate mission, BIOMASS. Several specific questions needed to be addressed to consolidate the mission concept following the Phase 0 studies, and the data collection strategy was constructed accordingly. More specifically, a tropical forest data set was required in order to provide test data for the evaluation of the foreseen inversion algorithms and data products. The paper provides a description of the resulting data set which is now available through the European Space Agency website under the airborne campaign link. First results from the TropiSAR database analysis are presented with two in-depth analyses about both the temporal radiometric variation and temporal coherence at P-band. The temporal variations of the backscatter values are less than 0.5 dB throughout the campaign, and the coherence values are observed to stay high even after 22 days. These results are essential for the BIOMASS mission. The observed temporal stability of the backscatter is a good indicator of the expected robustness of the biomass estimation in tropical forests, from cross-polarized backscatter values as regarding environmental changes such as soil moisture. The high temporal coherence observed after a 22-day period is a prerequisite for SAR Polarimetric Interferometry and Tomographic applications in a single satellite configuration. The conclusion then summarizes the paper and identifies the next steps in the analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomass","Calibration","Spaceborne radar","Coherence","Laser radar","Vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forestry","geophysical techniques","hydrology","inverse problems","moisture","radiometry","remote sensing by radar","soil","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TropiSAR airborne campaign","French Guiana","backscatter signal","AD 2009 08","ONERA airborne radar system","SETHI","tropical forest data set","inversion algorithms","European Space Agency","temporal radiometric variation","temporal coherence","P-band","biomass estimation","tropical forests","soil moisture","SAR polarimetric interferometry","tomographic application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forestry","interferometry","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2180728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6243179/06146421.pdf","startPage":"3228","endPage":"3241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6243179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2180728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The TropiSAR Airborne Campaign in French Guiana: Objectives, Description, and Observed Temporal Behavior of the Backscatter Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The TropiSAR Airborne Campaign in French Guiana: Objectives, Description, and Observed Temporal Behavior of the Backscatter Signal","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146421/","volume":"50","issue":"8","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146421/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12866550","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The TropiSAR Airborne Campaign in French Guiana: Objectives, Description, and Observed Temporal Behavior of the Backscatter Signal","sourcePdf":"tgrs-duboisfernandez-2180728-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151768S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6243179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6243179","articleId":"6146421","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6146425,"authors":[{"name":"Rosa A.

The proposed architecture is based on a frequency-domain approach. It consists of multiple channels to down-convert the input signal, each of which obtains a small portion of the input's spectrum. Overlapping bands are designated in between every two adjacent channels, so that multiple narrow-band outcomes can be accurately merged to construct the entire spectrum through postprocessing. The resultant complex-valued spectrum is equivalent to that where the impulses are directly measured in the time domain. The architecture in this paper resembles traditional superheterodyne receivers, and hence, its circuit implementation is simple and robust and has low cost. In our circuit implementation, all the components involved (like oscillators and mixers) are commercially available and have low costs. The circuit is tested by two types of input impulses, both having spectra centered at 2.1 GHz. The input signals' spectra (including both magnitude and phase) obtained by our circuit show excellent agreement with the data measured by a 40-GHz oscilloscope. When the input signal-to-noise ratio is as low as 2 dB, the output of our frequency-domain approach is equivalent to that of a 4-b high-speed ADC.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2184012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2184012","startPage":"1757","endPage":"1764","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6197268/06146427.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6197268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Measurement of Impulses Based on Frequency-Domain Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Measurement of Impulses Based on Frequency-Domain Approach","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2012","volume":"61","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146427/","accessionNumber":"12711903","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146427/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Measurement of Impulses Based on Frequency-Domain Approach","sourcePdf":"tim-lu-2184012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100449S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6197268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6197268","articleId":"6146427","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6146443,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Lie","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6184677/6146443/6146443-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xu Lie (M\u201911) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 2003, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He joined the Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, where he was involved in research on multilevel matrix converter.

These images make up a large amount of current multimedia data and are closely related to our daily life. To efficiently browse, retrieve and organize the web images, numerous approaches have been proposed. Since the semantic concepts of the images can be indicated by label information, automatic image annotation becomes one effective technique for image management tasks. Most existing annotation methods use image features that are often noisy and redundant. Hence, feature selection can be exploited for a more precise and compact representation of the images, thus improving the annotation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method and apply it to automatic image annotation. There are two appealing properties of our method. First, it can jointly select the most relevant features from all the data points by using a sparsity-based model. Second, it can uncover the shared subspace of original features, which is beneficial for multi-label learning. To solve the objective function of our method, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm. Extensive experiments are performed on large image databases that are collected from the web. The experimental results together with the theoretical analysis have validated the effectiveness of our method for feature selection, thus demonstrating its feasibility of being applied to web image annotation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146459/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12853308","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Web Image Annotation Via Subspace-Sparsity Collaborated Feature Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Image Annotation Via Subspace-Sparsity Collaborated Feature Selection","sourcePdf":"tmm-ma-2187179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098259S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6239698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"6239698","articleId":"6146459","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":6146461,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoshu Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Chaoshu","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37288161900"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093000"},{"name":"Muralidhar Rangaswamy","affiliation":["RYAP, AFRL, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Muralidhar","lastName":"Rangaswamy","id":"37285007800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6146461","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":858},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Vectors","Covariance matrix","Signal to noise ratio","Clutter","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","covariance matrices","filtering theory","interference (signal)","iterative methods","matched filters","signal detection","vectors","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient matched filter","CG algorithm","weight vector","iterative algorithm","test statistic","CG-MF detector","covariance matrix","constant false alarm rate","CFAR","signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio","SINR","linear detector","Krylov subspace","white noise","perturbation component","residual interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conjugate gradient method","Krylov subspace","matched filter","space-time adaptive processing (STAP)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Conjugate Gradient Matched Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146461","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2187200","startPage":"2660","endPage":"2666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6181849/06146461.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2187200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6181849","abstract":"The conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm is an efficient method for the calculation of the weight vector of the matched filter (MF). As an iterative algorithm, it produces a series of approximations to the MF weight vector, each of which can be used to filter the test signal and form a test statistic. This effectively leads to a family of detectors, referred to as the CG-MF detectors, which are indexed by the number of iterations incurred. We first consider a general case involving an arbitrary covariance matrix of the disturbance (including interference, noise, etc.) and show that all CG-MF detectors attain constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and, furthermore, are optimum in the sense that the th CG-MF detector yields the highest output signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) among all linear detectors within the th Krylov subspace. We then consider a structured case frequently encountered in practice, where the covariance matrix of the disturbance contains a low-rank component (rank- ) due to dominant interference sources, a scaled identity due to the presence of a white noise, and a perturbation component containing the residual interference. We show that the st CG-MF detector achieves CFAR and an output SINR nearly identical to that of the MF detector which requires complete iterations of the CG algorithm till reaching convergence. Hence, the st CG-MF detector can be used in place of the MF detector for significant computational saving when is small. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of our analysis for the CG-MF detectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146461/","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6146461/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12656275","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Conjugate Gradient Matched Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Conjugate Gradient Matched Filter","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2187200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059806S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6181849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6181849","articleId":"6146461","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6146477,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-6804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1896"}],"articleNumber":"6146477","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Table of contents for the Special Supplement on Optical Communications Supplement Next Generation Optical Transport Beyond 100G (Feb. 2012, vol. 50, no. 2) .","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6146464/06146477.pdf","startPage":"s2","endPage":"s2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical communications supplement next generation optical transport beyond 100G - Table of contents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146477/","displayDocTitle":"Optical communications supplement next generation optical transport beyond 100G - Table of contents","volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical communications supplement next generation optical transport beyond 100G - Table of contents","sourcePdf":"013LYT-Supplement-TOC-FEBRUARY.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026229S","chronDate":"February  2012","isNumber":"6146464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6146477","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6146481,"authors":[{"name":"Ori Gerstel","affiliation":["Cisco, Inc., Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Ori Gerstel [m'95, SM'05, F'08] (ogerstel@cisco.com) is a principal engineer at Cisco, where he is responsible for identifying opportunities for integration of routers and transport technologies, such as the IP over DWDM architecture.

However, market demands typically do not evolve simply in discrete steps; therefore, the future evolution of LTE-Advanced will be a story of continuous enhancement, on one hand taking advantage of the advancing capabilities of technology, while on the other aiming to keep pace with the expectations and needs of the end users. In this article, the likely directions of this continuing enhancement are discussed, and some areas where further technical advancement will be required are identified. In particular, potential measures to enhance the efficiency of spectrum utilization by joint multicell optimization, dynamic adaptation of the network to traffic characteristics and load levels, and support for new applications are highlighted.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146490","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6146464/06146490.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From LTE-advanced to the future","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"From LTE-advanced to the future","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146490/","volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6146490/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525253","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From LTE-advanced to the future","sourcePdf":"026BAKERLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037634S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6146464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6146464","articleId":"6146490","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6146491,"authors":[{"name":"Zukang Shen","affiliation":["China Academy of Telecommunication and Technology, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zukang Shen (shenzukang@catt.cn) is a senior technical manager with the China Academy of Telecommunication Technology (CATT).

Further development of the specification (LTE-Advanced) is expected to conform to the requirements for IMT-Advanced systems. One of the key enabling features of LTE-Advanced to meet IMT-Advanced downlink performance requirements is multi-user MIMO, where a transmitter serves multiple users simultaneously on the same frequency resource, primarily relying on spatial separation. In general, multi-user MIMO is beneficial for improving average user spectral efficiency. However, cell edge user spectral efficiency may be reduced if multi-user MIMO is used exclusively, due to residual inter-user interference arising from practical multi-user beamforming and reduced transmit power allocated to each user. Therefore, it should be possible to configure the UE-specific transmission mode to support dynamic switching between single-user MIMO and multi-user MIMO to balance the cell edge user spectral efficiency as well as the average cell user spectral efficiency. In this article, we study various aspects of multi-user MIMO including design philosophy, multi-user precoding, and control signaling. The associated feedback schemes, including those that facilitate dynamic switching, are discussed. Performance evaluation is conducted to demonstrate the gain of dynamically switched single-user and multiuser MIMO as opposed to traditional single-user MIMO.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6146464/06146493.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink MIMO in LTE-advanced: SU-MIMO vs. MU-MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146493/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink MIMO in LTE-advanced: SU-MIMO vs. MU-MIMO","volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525256","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146493/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink MIMO in LTE-advanced: SU-MIMO vs. MU-MIMO","sourcePdf":"029LIULAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046422S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6146464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"6146464","articleId":"6146493","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6146494,"authors":[{"name":"Daewon Lee","affiliation":["LG Electronics Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Daewon Lee (dwlee@ieee.org) received the B.S. and M.S. degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.

In CoMP operation, multiple points coordinate with each other in such a way that the transmission signals from/to other points do not incur serious interference or even can be exploited as a meaningful signal. The goal of the study is to evaluate the potential performance benefits of CoMP techniques and the implementation aspects including the complexity of the standards support for CoMP. This article discusses some of the deployment scenarios in which CoMP techniques will likely be most beneficial and provides an overview of CoMP schemes that might be supported in LTE-Advanced given the modern silicon/DSP technologies and backhaul designs available today. In addition, practical implementation and operational challenges are discussed. We also assess the performance benefits of CoMP in these deployment scenarios with traffic varying from low to high load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","volume":"50","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12525257","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146494/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated multipoint transmission and reception in LTE-advanced: deployment scenarios and operational challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated multipoint transmission and reception in LTE-advanced: deployment scenarios and operational challenges","sourcePdf":"030LEELAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06048S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6146464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"497","xplore-issue":"6146464","articleId":"6146494","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6146495,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Hoymann","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Christian Hoymann (christian.hoymann@ericsson.com) received his Diploma degree in electrical engineering from RWTH Aachen University in 2002.

These new types of deployments are commonly referred to as heterogeneous networks and are currently receiving significant attention in industry. However, simple deployment of low-power nodes can lead to underutilization of air-interface resources due to the relatively small footprint of the lowpower nodes or service outage in the case of femto cells with restricted access. Time-domain interference management techniques by the configuration of almost blank subframes, introduced in LTE Rel-10 standards, allow the removal of most of the interference from the dominant interfering nodes. This mechanism enables cell biasing or cell range extension of weak cells, thereby maximizing the incremental gain provided by the deployment of low-power nodes. The configuration of ABS changes the interference conditions seen by the user equipment and therefore requires corresponding resource-specific measurements and feedback at the UE. In this article, we provide an overview of LTE Rel-10 resource specific radio link monitoring, radio resource management, and channel state information feedback procedures. Also, we provide evaluation results to show that UE receivers, in the detection of weak cells and removal of interference in demodulation of control and data channels, play a critical role in realizing the full potential that the deployment of heterogeneous networks can offer.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6146464/06146496.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6146496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UE's role in LTE advanced heterogeneous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146496/","displayDocTitle":"UE's role in LTE advanced heterogeneous networks","volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525259","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146496/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UE's role in LTE advanced heterogeneous networks","sourcePdf":"032DAMNJANOVICLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068195S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6146464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6146464","articleId":"6146496","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6146497,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwoon Bai","affiliation":["Mobile Solutions Lab, Samsung Electronics Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Dongwoon Bai (dongwoon.bai@samsung.com) is a staff engineer at Samsung Mobile Solutions Laboratory, San Diego, California.

The RT-ADPD system requirements, architecture, and its design methodology are analyzed in detail, with particular emphasis on the optimization of the feedback loop convergence speed and stability. A novel, compact algorithm to achieve rapid adaptation of the predistortion lookup tables, without any prior knowledge of the PA distortion characteristics, is introduced. A prototype of the RT-ADPD system is implemented using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and it is experimentally exploited to linearize a handset WCDMA PA module. Due to the linearization action, the PA maximum modulated output power is increased by 1.9 dB, to 30.9 dBm, and its power-added efficiency by 9%, to 48.5%, still maintaining a -40-dB ACPR at a 5-MHz offset. In addition, a true closed-loop adaptation ensures excellent PA linearity under load mismatch and other environmental variations. Indeed, ACPR is improved by up to 15 dB, below -47 dB, under 2:1 VSWR at 28 dBm. Remarkably fast adaptation speed is also demonstrated, as adequate signal fidelity is achieved within a ~50-\u03bcs time frame.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Loop Digital Predistortion System With Fast Real-Time Adaptation Applied to a Handset WCDMA PA Module","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2181860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6158747/06146502.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2181860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6158747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Loop Digital Predistortion System With Fast Real-Time Adaptation Applied to a Handset WCDMA PA Module","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6146502/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571117","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Loop Digital Predistortion System With Fast Real-Time Adaptation Applied to a Handset WCDMA PA Module","sourcePdf":"tmtt-asbeck-2181860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106858S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6158747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6158747","articleId":"6146502","onlineDate":"06 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6146503,"authors":[{"name":"Sen Fu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6158747/6146503/6146503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sen Fu was born in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China, in 1986.

Coupling coefficients between two resonators in both bands can be controlled independently and external quality factors are also controlled by a particularly-designed coplanar waveguide (CPW) feed line. Three types of filters are designed to validate the analysis. They are direct coupling dual-mode dual-band filter, source-load coupling dual-mode dual-band filter with a better band-to-band isolation and CPW-feed dual-mode dual-band filter with a wider bandwidth.

Four types of agents, which are switch agent, central coordinator-agent, local controller-agent, and load agent, cooperate with each other to achieve the overall control goals.

In conventional pair-based STDP learning, synaptic weights are altered by utilizing the temporal difference between pairs of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. This learning rule, however, fails to reproduce reported experimental measurements when using stimuli either by patterns consisting of triplet or quadruplet of spikes or increasing the repetition frequency of pairs of spikes. Significantly, a previously described spike triplet-based STDP rule succeeds in reproducing all of these experimental observations. In this paper, we present a new spike triplet-based VLSI implementation, that is based on a previous pair-based STDP circuit [1]. This implementation can reproduce similar results to those observed in various physiological STDP experiments, in contrast to traditional pair-based VLSI implementation.

We base our work on two observations. Firstly, most physical phenomena are compressible in some transform domain basis. Secondly, most WSNs have some form of heterogeneity. Given these two observations, we propose a non-uniform compressive sensing method to improve the performance of WSNs by exploiting both compressibility and heterogeneity. We apply our proposed method to a real WSN data set. We find that our method can provide a more accurate temporal-spatial profile for a given energy budget compared with other sampling methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146546","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135451/6146511/06146546.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-uniform compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks: Feasibility and application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146546/","displayDocTitle":"Non-uniform compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks: Feasibility and application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12541346","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146546/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-uniform compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks: Feasibility and application","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"3153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086628S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135451","isNumber":"6146511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135451","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6146511","articleId":"6146546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146549,"authors":[{"name":"Ba-Tuong Vo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Tuong","lastName":"Vo","id":"37289281300"},{"name":"Ba-Ngu Vo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Ngu","lastName":"Vo","id":"37274760500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0674-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0675-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0673-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146549","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":606},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Clutter","Estimation","Time measurement","Uncertainty","Coordinate measuring machines","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","filtering theory","Markov processes","radar tracking","set theory","sonar tracking","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random finite set","multitarget tracking","multiobject estimation","data association uncertainty","detection uncertainty","false observations","Bayesian framework","Markov shift","Bayes rule","multitarget observation likelihood","Bayes multitarget filter","linear Gaussian multitarget mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Random sets","Multi-Target Bayes filter","Multi-Bernoulli","Conjugate prior","Tracking"]}],"abstract":"The objective of multi-object estimation is to simultaneously estimate the number of objects and their states from a set of observations in the presence of data association uncertainty, detection uncertainty, false observations and noise. This estimation problem can be formulated in a Bayesian framework by modeling the (hidden) set of states and set of observations as random finite sets (RFSs) where the model for the observation covers thinning, Markov shifts and superposition of false observations. A prior for the hidden RFS together with the likelihood of the realisation of the observed RFS gives the posterior distribution via the application of Bayes rule. We propose a new class of prior distribution and show that it is a conjugate prior with respect to the multi-target observation likelihood. This result is then applied to develop an analytic implementation of the Bayes multi-target filter for the class of linear Gaussian multi-target models.","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146549","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135451/6146511/06146549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146511","startPage":"431","endPage":"436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A random finite set conjugate prior and application to multi-target tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A random finite set conjugate prior and application to multi-target tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146549/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12541349","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146549/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A random finite set conjugate prior and application to multi-target tracking","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"3249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067071S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135451","isNumber":"6146511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135451","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6146511","articleId":"6146549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6146558,"authors":[{"name":"Parham H.

The first phase of the algorithm utilizes an improved version of the DV-distance method used to provide coarse position estimates for all the nodes. During the second phase, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is performed to fine tune and obtain accurate estimation of the locations. In the second phase, several techniques are also used to address the main problems of localization such as flip ambiguity, collective translation and error propagation. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, numerical simulations were performed and the results were compared with similar distance-based methods, namely one-phase simulated annealing (SA), trilateration and simulated annealing (TSA) and semi-definite programming localization (SDP). Results demonstrate that our proposal achieves a significant performance improvement in comparison to other related methods especially in networks with low connectivity.","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146558","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135451/6146511/06146558.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node localization using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Node localization using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12541358","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6146558/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node localization using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"3793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056346S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135451","isNumber":"6146511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135451","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6146511","articleId":"6146558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6146563,"authors":[{"name":"Duc Minh Pham","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of South Australia, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Duc Minh","lastName":"Pham","id":"38238990800"},{"name":"Syed Mahfuzul Aziz","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of South Australia, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Syed Mahfuzul","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37298607900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0674-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0675-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0673-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146563","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Image processing","Wireless sensor networks","Field programmable gate arrays","Power demand","Hardware","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image processing","image processing equipment","multimedia communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA architecture","object extraction","wireless multimedia sensor network","image processing system","customized processor","networking function","image processing block","total energy consumption","image communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","image processing","object detection","image communication","coprocessors"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the architecture of a FPGA-based efficient image processing system suited to Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks. The system consists of two major processing elements: a customized processor for the networking functions and an image processing block. The latter enables the system to detect and extract any updated objects in captured images in real-time. The proposed architecture is optimized to achieve high speed processing with minimum hardware requirement and power consumption. Experimental results show that for a detected object of average size, the proposed architecture helps to reduce the total energy consumption by approximately twenty times compared to the energy consumed for raw image transmission. The system was successfully designed and implemented on FPGA. Implementation results of a network utilizing the proposed architecture reveal that this novel approach is suitable for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network due to low hardware and low energy requirement for image communication.","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146563","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135451/6146511/06146563.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA architecture for object extraction in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146563/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA architecture for object extraction in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12541363","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146563/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA architecture for object extraction in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"3837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068888S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135451","isNumber":"6146511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135451","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6146511","articleId":"6146563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146572,"authors":[{"name":"Runchun Wang","affiliation":["Bioelectronics and Neuroscience Research Group, University of Western Ontario, Australia"],"firstName":"Runchun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716128300"},{"name":"Jonathan Tapson","affiliation":["Bioelectronics and Neuroscience Research Group, University of Western Ontario, Australia"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Tapson","id":"37317433100"},{"name":"Tara Julia Hamilton","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Tara Julia","lastName":"Hamilton","id":"37542216900"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 van Schaik","affiliation":["Bioelectronics and Neuroscience Research Group, University of Western Ontario, Australia"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"van Schaik","id":"37269982000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0674-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0675-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0673-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146572","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Neurons","Generators","Fires","Training","Firing","Threshold current"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","polychronous spiking neural networks","spatial-temporal spike pattern storing","spatial-temporal spike pattern retrieving","spiking leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons","axonal connections","programmable delays","CMOS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analogue VLSI","polychronous network","delay adaptation","spiking neurons"]}],"abstract":"We present an analogue VLSI implementation of a polychronous network of spiking neurons.

These blocks, can be used to implement either supervised or unsupervised learning modules. This is achieved using a crosspoint architecture which is an efficient array implementation for nanoscale two-terminal mem-ristive devices. Based on these blocks and an experimentally verified SPICE macromodel for the memristor, we demonstrate that firstly, the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) can be implemented by a single memristor device and secondly, a memristor-based competitive Hebbian learning through STDP using a 1\u00d71000 synaptic network. This is achieved by adjusting the memristor's conductance values (weights) as a function of the timing difference between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. These implementations have a number of shortcomings due to the memristor's characteristics such as memory decay, highly nonlinear switching behaviour as a function of applied voltage/current, and functional uniformity. These shortcomings can be addressed by utilising a mixed gates that can be used in conjunction with the analogue behaviour for biomimetic computation.

Kinematics of various body parts and joints can be quantified by attaching inertial sensors at points of interest and integrating the observed acceleration and angular velocity signals. It is broadly accepted that this measurement procedure is significantly influenced by cumulative errors arising from sensor noise, non-linearities, asymmetries, sensitivity variations and bias drifts. In addition, it is also known that linear acceleration superimposed to the gravity acceleration introduces errors when calculating tilt angles. Recently, newer techniques using sensor fusion methods have shown error reduction in orientation measurements, but require additional hardware and consume more energy. In this paper, we assess the accuracy of a low-power wireless inertial system (ViMove) that measures Low Back (lumbar spine) orientation in three dimensions. The system consists of two inertial units (sensor), with each sensor containing one tri-axis accelerometer and one single-axis gyroscope. We investigate the accuracy of 1D, 2D and 3D simultaneous movements by means of root mean square error (RMSE) computed in comparison with NDI Optotrak, an optical tracking system. The RMSE achieved for one dimensional movements in the Flexion, Lateral Flexion and Twist planes were 1.0\u00b0, 0.5\u00b0 and 2.4\u00b0 respectively, and 2.1\u00b0, 2.4\u00b0 and 4.6\u00b0 for three dimensional movements.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146511","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135451/6146511/06146618.pdf","endPage":"63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and validation of an ambulatory inertial system for 3-D measurements of low back movements","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146618","startPage":"58","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and validation of an ambulatory inertial system for 3-D measurements of low back movements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146618/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12541418","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6146618/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and validation of an ambulatory inertial system for 3-D measurements of low back movements","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"7267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116356S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135451","isNumber":"6146511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135451","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6146511","articleId":"6146618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6146670,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper a Genetic Algorithm based color image authentication/data hiding technique through steganographic approach, in frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) termed as GASFD, has been proposed. 2\u00d72 masks are taken from the source image in row major order where DFT is used to transform original image (cover image) block from spatial domain to frequency domain. Three bits of the hidden image are embedded per byte of the source image onto the rightmost 3 bits of each pixel excluding the first byte of each mask, as a result large volume of message/ image is embedded in frequency domain. 2\u00d72 embedded image mask is transformed from frequency domain to spatial domain using inverse DFT. Resulting image mask of size 32 bits are taken as initial population. New Generation and Crossover are applied on the initial population to obtain stego image. In the process of embedding dimension of the hidden image followed by the content of the message/hidden image are embedded. Reverse process is followed during decoding.

efficiently avoiding interference with licensed or unlicensed users. The spectrum sharing network consisting of a pair of primary users (PUs) and a pair of cognitive users (CRs) in a fading channel. The pair of PUs establishes a wireless link as the PU link. The PU link and CR link utilize spectrum simultaneously with different priorities. The PU link has a higher priority to utilize spectrum with respect to the CR link. When the PU link utilizes spectrum, a desired quality of service (QoS) is given to be assured and the CR utilizes spectrum with an opportunistic power scale under this constraint, assuring the desired QoS on the PU link. To compute an optimal opportunistic power scale for the CR link, a fuzzy-based opportunistic power control strategy is proposed based on the Mamdani fuzzy control model using three input variables: the PU's SNR and PU's interference channel gain, as well as Relative distance between PU's link and CR link. The proposed system is found to give the satisfactory results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIndA.2011.6146677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146637","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communication and Industrial Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142445/6146637/06146677.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new fuzzy rule based power management scheme for spectrum sharing in cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6146677/","displayDocTitle":"A new fuzzy rule based power management scheme for spectrum sharing in cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540281","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new fuzzy rule based power management scheme for spectrum sharing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"31ANewFuzzyRuleBasedPower.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077191S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142445","isNumber":"6146637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142445","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6146637","articleId":"6146677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6146679,"authors":[{"name":"Niladri Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Haldia Institute of Technology, WBUT, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Niladri","lastName":"Mandal","id":"38235732600"},{"name":"Himadri Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Haldia Institute of Technology, WBUT, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Himadri","lastName":"Mandal","id":"38233239000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1917-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1915-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1916-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146679","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","OFDM","Transceivers","Cognitive radio","Computers","Flowcharts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","communication complexity","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","performance evaluation","radio spectrum management","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","NC-OFDM","cognitive radio system","revolutionary evolution","wireless communication","licensed services only","NC_OFDM based cognitive radio","individual subcarriers","interference","licensed user","zero valued inputs","zero valued outputs","non-zero terms","IFFT/FFT modules","OFDM based transceiver","IFFT/FFT algorithm","execution time","input zero traced FFT pruning algorithm","IZTFFTP algorithm","DIF radix-2 technique","time complexity","space complexity","complex multiplication","complex additions","high level computer program","C++","Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT algorithm","programming modification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","NC_OFDM","FFT","FFT Pruning","Execution time"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio is a revolutionary evolution of future wireless communication to utilize the unused part of the spectrum, which is actually assigned to licensed services only. An NC_OFDM based cognitive radio has the capability to nullify individual sub carriers to avoid interference with the licensed user. So, that there could be a large number of zero valued inputs/outputs compare to non-zero terms. From the standard structure of OFDM we can find that IFFT/FFT modules play the vital role for any OFDM based transceiver. So when zero valued inputs/outputs outnumber nonzero inputs/outputs, then general IFFT/FFT algorithm for OFDM is no longer efficient in term of execution time. It is possible to reduce the execution time by \u201cpruning\u201d the FFT. In this paper we have implemented a novel and efficient input zero traced FFT pruning (IZTFFTP) algorithm based on DIF radix-2 technique. Compare to other algorithms, the results of IZFFTP shows that it is independent of the position of the zero valued input and also maintaining a good trade-off between time and space complexity of any system by not only reducing the number of complex multiplication as well as complex additions also extraordinarily. The proposed algorithm is implemented in high level computer program i.e. in C++ and this is similar to the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT algorithm, retaining all the key features such as simplicity and regularity, by making some alternation and programming modification.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIndA.2011.6146679","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communication and Industrial Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communication and Industrial Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142445/6146637/06146679.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIndA.2011.6146679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146637","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and performance analysis of an efficient FFT pruning algorithm for NC-OFDM based cognitive radio system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and performance analysis of an efficient FFT pruning algorithm for NC-OFDM based cognitive radio system","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146679/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540283","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146679/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and performance analysis of an efficient FFT pruning algorithm for NC-OFDM based cognitive radio system","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"33ImplementationandPerformanceAnalysis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050764S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142445","isNumber":"6146637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142445","xplore-issue":"6146637","articleId":"6146679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6146680,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Dhar Roy","affiliation":["ECE Department, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay Dhar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400812100"},{"name":"Sumit Kundu","affiliation":["ECE Department, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37401883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1917-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1915-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1916-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146680","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146680","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Cognitive radio","Correlation","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Downlink","Shadow mapping","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","error statistics","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular networks","secondary users","downlink interference modelling","cognitive radio frequency planned environment","dynamic spectrum sharing","spectrum underlay approach","outage probability","log normal interferers","channel parameters","primary users","cochannel base station"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Outage probability","Cognitive radio","Cellular Network","Correlated interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIndA.2011.6146680","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communication and Industrial Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communication and Industrial Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142445/6146637/06146680.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIndA.2011.6146680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the coexistence of cognitive radio and cellular networks: An outage analysis","abstract":"In this paper, coexistence of cellular network with cognitive radio (CR) users or secondary users (SUs) has been studied.

In this work, an effort has been made to simulate and design a low power consuming custom hardware for MIMO-OFDM system based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Both the transmitters and the receivers were designed in the simulation environment targeting Xilinx Spartan 3E and Spartan 3A FPGA devices. The design was also implemented on the mentioned FPGA hardware and real experiments were carried out for the verification of the design.

The data is retained by the cell with the help of leakage current and positive feedback, and does not use any refresh cycle. The size of the new cell is comparable to the conventional six-transistor cell of same technology and design rules. Also, the proposed cells uses a single bit-line for both read and write purposes. The cell proposed in this paper consumes less dynamic power and has higher read stability than the standard one. In conventional six-transistor (6T) SRAM cell, read stability is very low due to the voltage division between the access and driver transistors during read operation. In existing SRAM topologies of 8T, 9T and higher transistor count, the read static noise margin (SNM) is increased but size of the cell and power consumption increases relatively. In the proposed technique, the SRAM cell operates by charging/discharging of a single bit-line (BL) during read and write operation, resulting in reduction of dynamic power consumption to only 40% to 60% (best case/worst case) of that of a conventional 6T SRAM cell. The power consumption is further decreased if the switching operational voltage of the bit-line lies between 0.25VDD to 0.5VDD. All simulations are done using 0.18um Technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Stability analysis","Noise","Power demand","Delay","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","embedded systems","power aware computing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power single bitline 6T SRAM cell","high read stability","CMOS 6-transistor SRAM cell","low power embedded SRAM applications","stand alone SRAM applications","design rules","read write purposes","static noise margin","bit-line","power consumption","0.18um technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single bit-line","low power","SRAM","6T Cell","read stable"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146862","doi":"10.1109/ReTIS.2011.6146862","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138393/6146829/06146862.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReTIS.2011.6146862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146862/","displayDocTitle":"Low power single bitline 6T SRAM cell with high read stability","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12542047","htmlLink":"/document/6146862/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power single bitline 6T SRAM cell with high read stability","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"3349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062026S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138393","isNumber":"6146829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138393","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6146829","articleId":"6146862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146873,"authors":[{"name":"Sudeb Das","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sudeb","lastName":"Das","id":"38195121200"},{"name":"Malay Kumar Kundu","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Malay Kumar","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37269302300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0792-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0790-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0791-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146873","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Neurons","Joining processes","Biomedical imaging","Frequency domain analysis","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete transforms","image fusion","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ripplet based multimodality medical image fusion","pulse coupled neural network","modified spatial frequency","ripplet transform Type-I","MIF scheme","discrete RT","low frequency subband","LFS","max selection rule","high frequency subband fusion","PCNN model","inverse DRT domain","IDRT","mutual information","spatial frequency","entropy","quantitative analysis","visual analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Fusion","Ripplet Transform","Multi-scale Geometric Analysis","PCNN","Mutual Information"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146873","abstract":"In this paper, a novel multimodality Medical Image Fusion (MIF) method, based on Ripplet Transform Type-I (RT) using Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) is presented. The proposed MIF scheme exploits the advantages of both RT and PCNN to obtain better results. The source medical images are first decomposed by discrete RT (DRT). The low-frequency subbands (LFSs) are fused using the `max selection' rule. For the fusion of high-frequency subbands (HFSs) a PCNN model is utilized. Modified Spatial Frequency (MSF) in DRT domain is input to motivate the PCNN and coefficients in DRT domain with large firing times are selected as coefficients of the fused image. Then inverse DRT (IDRT) is applied to the fused coefficients to get the fused image. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by various quantitative measures like Mutual Information (MI), Spatial Frequency (SF), and Entropy (EN) etc. Visual and quantitative analysis and comparisons show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in fusing multimodality medical images.","doi":"10.1109/ReTIS.2011.6146873","startPage":"229","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReTIS.2011.6146873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146829","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6138393/6146829/06146873.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ripplet based multimodality Medical Image Fusion using Pulse-Coupled Neural Network and Modified Spatial Frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146873/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ripplet based multimodality Medical Image Fusion using Pulse-Coupled Neural Network and Modified Spatial Frequency","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6146873/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12542057","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ripplet based multimodality Medical Image Fusion using Pulse-Coupled Neural Network and Modified Spatial Frequency","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"4451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078098S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6138393","isNumber":"6146829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6138393","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6146829","articleId":"6146873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6146875,"authors":[{"name":"Malay K.

In this paper, a novel face recognition technique based on wavelet transform and Hierarchical Multi-scale Local Binary Pattern (HMLBP) is presented and shown to increase the accuracy of recognition of avatar faces. The proposed technique consists of three stages: preprocessing, feature extraction and recognition. In the preprocessing and feature extraction stages, the wavelet decomposition is used to enhance the common features of the same class of images and the HMLBP is used to extract representative features from each avatar face image without a need for any training. In the recognition stage, the Chi-Square distance is used to achieve a robust decision and to indicate the correct class to which the input image belongs. Experiments conducted on two manually cropped avatar image datasets (Second Life and Entropia Universe) show that the proposed technique performs better than traditional (single scale) LBP, Wavelet Local Binary Pattern (WLBP) and HMLBP in terms of accuracy (78.57% and 67.50% recognition rates for Second Life and Entropia Universe datasets respectively).","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2011.41","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6146696/6146931/06146968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146931","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avatar Face Recognition Using Wavelet Transform and Hierarchical Multi-scale LBP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Avatar Face Recognition Using Wavelet Transform and Hierarchical Multi-scale LBP","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146968/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540580","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6146968/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avatar Face Recognition Using Wavelet Transform and Hierarchical Multi-scale LBP","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4607a194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050776S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6146696","isNumber":"6146931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6146696","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6146931","articleId":"6146968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6146987,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and Art, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Cheung","id":"38232403500"},{"name":"Carl Sable","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and Art, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Sable","id":"38232918200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2134-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4607-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146987","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146987","abstract":"With the increasing trend of neural network models towards larger structures with more layers, we expect a corresponding exponential increase in the number of possible architectures.

Using parameters found from the evolutionary search together with absolute value and local contrast normalization preprocessing between layers, we achieve the best known performance on several of the MNIST Variations, rectangles-image and convex image datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2011.73","startPage":"293","endPage":"297","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6146696/6146931/06146987.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Evolution of Convolutional Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Training","Jacobian matrices","Object recognition","Neural networks","Noise reduction","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid evolution","convolutional networks","neural network models","hybrid evolutionary search procedure","architectural parameters","initialization parameters","stochastic diagonal Levenberg-Marquardt","MNIST Variations","convex image datasets","rectangles image datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","convolutional networks","evolution","second order methods","image classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Evolution of Convolutional Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6146987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540599","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Evolution of Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4607a293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081451S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6146696","isNumber":"6146931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6146696","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6146931","articleId":"6146987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":6146990,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Ninomiya","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Faculty of Technology, Shonan Institute of Technology, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ninomiya","id":"37340653100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2134-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4607-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6146990","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146990","abstract":"This paper describes a novel robust training algorithm based on quasi-Newton process in which online and batch error functions are associated by a weighting coefficient parameter.

These examples are described by a set of TSP characteristics and the cost of solutions obtained by a set of optimization methods. The trained MLP network model is then used to predict a ranking of these methods for a new TSP instance. Correlation measures are used to compare the predicted ranking with the ranking previously known. The obtained results suggest that the proposed approach is promising.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2011.153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.153","startPage":"346","endPage":"351","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6146696/6146931/06146996.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Meta-learning to Recommend Meta-heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Using Meta-learning to Recommend Meta-heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6146996/","accessionNumber":"12540608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6146996/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Meta-learning to Recommend Meta-heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4607a346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090383S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6146696","isNumber":"6146931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6146696","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6146931","articleId":"6146996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6147009,"authors":[{"name":"Asghar Dehghani","affiliation":["New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM, US"],"firstName":"Asghar","lastName":"Dehghani","id":"37087711241"},{"name":"Jun Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38244028500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2134-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4607-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6147009","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":470},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6147009","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Estimation","Accuracy","Kernel","Machine learning","Wireless sensor networks","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","problem solving","sampling methods","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual samples","small sample set problem solving","key factor","supervised learning","high acquisition cost","functional form","distribution patterns","problem constraints","optimization process","real-world learning problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["virtual sample","small sample set","inverse variate generator","kernel density estimator","machine learning"]}],"abstract":"As confirmed by theory and experiments, a key factor in successfully solving a supervised learning task, especially in the case that the hypothesis is highly complex, is the number of samples available to the learner. On the other hand, in real world applications, it may not be able to provide enough number of training samples to the learner because of high acquisition cost or incapability of obtaining samples. In this paper, we propose a method addressing the problem of learning with small sample set by generating additional virtual samples. In absence of any useful prior knowledge about the functional form of the target model, we take a closer look at the distribution patterns of available samples in low dimensional subspaces and constitute the rules that each sample, including virtual samples, must obey. These rules along with other problem constraints are used as weak conditions to refine the virtual samples through an optimization process. The method is applied to two real-world learning problems. The experimental results support the efficiency of the method for solving the small sample set problems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.18","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6146696/6146931/06147009.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"423","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2011.18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method to Generate Virtual Samples for Solving Small Sample Set Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A New Method to Generate Virtual Samples for Solving Small Sample Set Problems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6147009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540621","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147009/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method to Generate Virtual Samples for Solving Small Sample Set Problems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4607a420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069867S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6146696","isNumber":"6146931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6146696","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6146931","articleId":"6147009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6147024,"authors":[{"name":"Neha Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Neha","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085395340"},{"name":"Ole-Christoffer Granmo","affiliation":["Department of ICT, University of Agder, Norway"],"firstName":"Ole-Christoffer","lastName":"Granmo","id":"37295135700"},{"name":"Ashok Agrawala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Agrawala","id":"37272314700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2134-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4607-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6147024","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1224},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6147024","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Educational institutions","Dynamics","Bayesian methods","Electronic mail","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","probability","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic Thompson sampling","dynamic multiarmed bandit","MAB problem","reward probability","DTS","order statistics","UCB-Normal","UCBf"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-Armed Bandits","Bayesian Techniques","Learning Algorithms"]}],"abstract":"The importance of multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems is on the rise due to their recent application in a large variety of areas such as online advertising, news article selection, wireless networks, and medicinal trials, to name a few.

Through the computer simulations using the ORL face dataset, we show that the extended RAN-MTPR works well as a multitask learning model.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2011.16","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6147038","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6146696/6147038/06147045.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Model for Learning Data Stream with Multiple Class Labels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147045/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Model for Learning Data Stream with Multiple Class Labels","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6147045/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12540643","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Model for Learning Data Stream with Multiple Class Labels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4607b035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085999S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6146696","isNumber":"6147038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6146696","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6147038","articleId":"6147045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6147092,"authors":[{"name":"Niva Das","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Siksha O Anusandhana University, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India"],"firstName":"Niva","lastName":"Das","id":"37968132400"},{"name":"Aurobinda Routray","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, I.I.T, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Aurobinda","lastName":"Routray","id":"38571794700"},{"name":"Pradipta Kishore Dash","affiliation":["MDRC, Siksha O Anusandhana University, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India"],"firstName":"Pradipta Kishore","lastName":"Dash","id":"37279382100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0136-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0137-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0135-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6147092","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Source separation","Minimization","Least squares approximation","Vectors","Noise measurement","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","least squares approximations","matrix algebra","minimisation","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained least squares algorithm","blind source separation","nonstationary mixing environment","demixing matrix","Kullback-Liebler divergence minimization technique","KL algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["KL-divergence","Constrained Least Square approach","non-stationary","BSS","ICA"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a Constrained Least Square approach to the problem of Blind Source Separation (BSS) in a non-stationary mixing environment. Initially the demixing matrix is identified for the nominal system using the standard Kullback-Liebler(KL) divergence minimization technique. The KL algorithm is computationally expensive requiring longer CPU time and a large collection of samples. Therefore for small or structured changes in the mixing system which may occur due to environmental conditions this algorithm may be slow and inappropriate in certain applications. In this paper we have proposed an algorithm based on Constrained Least Square that utilizes the initially estimated demixing structure from the KL algorithm to find the new structure for the changed system. It is computationally faster even for larger number of samples. The assumptions are that the changes are infrequent and the statistical properties of the sources do not change. The performance of the technique has been compared with existing methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constrained least squares algorithm for fast Blind Source Separation in a non-stationary mixing environment","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Energy, Automation and Signal","doi":"10.1109/ICEAS.2011.6147092","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Energy, Automation and Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142446/6147061/06147092.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAS.2011.6147092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6147061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6147092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A constrained least squares algorithm for fast Blind Source Separation in a non-stationary mixing environment","conferenceDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6147092/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540321","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constrained least squares algorithm for fast Blind Source Separation in a non-stationary mixing environment","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"ICEAS20110023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064549S","chronDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142446","isNumber":"6147061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142446","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6147061","articleId":"6147092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6147093,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Everyday a bulk amount of power is generated, transmitted and distributed via transmission network. The active power or the real power generated from the generator needs the reactive power for supporting its own transmission. This reactive power generation has some minimum limit which if generator fails to produce it has to take support from system operator for smooth real power flow in worth of paying money. While the generator produces excess reactive power it can expect remuneration from the system operator. In deregulated power system minimal reactive power generation is considered as an important issue as cost is related to it. In this paper IEEE 14-bus test system is considered for solving the problem. As a solving tool a well known population based metaheuristics technique: particle swarm optimisation is chosen which tries to optimize the problem by controlling the generator bus voltage. The choice of the objective function and the mentioned optimisation technique is considered by through literature survey.","doi":"10.1109/ICEAS.2011.6147115","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Energy, Automation and Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142446/6147061/06147115.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Energy, Automation and Signal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAS.2011.6147115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6147061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive power generation minimization aspect in deregulatory power scenario using particle swarm optimization technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Generators","Load flow","Educational institutions","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","particle swarm optimisation","power generation control","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reactive power generation minimization aspect","deregulatory power scenario","particle swarm optimization technique","power system structure","restructuring process","power transmission network","power distributed network","real power flow","system operator","deregulated power system minimal reactive power generation","IEEE 14-bus test system","population based metaheuristics technique","generator bus voltage control","objective function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Balanced voltage profile","minimal of reactive power generation","particle swarm optimisation","real power output"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reactive power generation minimization aspect in deregulatory power scenario using particle swarm optimization technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6147115/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540344","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive power generation minimization aspect in deregulatory power scenario using particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"ICEAS20110046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072935S","chronDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142446","isNumber":"6147061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142446","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6147061","articleId":"6147115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6147137,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A problem is that current general purpose computers are no longer fast enough to deal with the ever increasing amounts of data that are passed through them due to the massive increases in network traffic and data storage capacities offered. This paper aims to demonstrate the significant performance gains that can be achieved by employing string matching algorithms directly in hardware using an FPGA, as opposed to the traditional software-only solution. A possible future FPGA-based string matching board that could be installed in current computers is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540366","htmlLink":"/document/6147137/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based string matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based string matching","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"ICEAS20110068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050234S","chronDate":"28-30 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142446","isNumber":"6147061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142446","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6147061","articleId":"6147137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6147139,"authors":[{"name":"Pyari Mohan Pradhan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6142446/6147061/6147139/6147139-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["P.

The proposed method is numerically verified through computer simulations on IEEE 30-bus system consist of six suppliers and two large consumers are participated in the bidding process.

motion and stereo vision information. The proposed system controls pan and tilt actuators attached to a stereo camera, using the data from a gyroscope, robot wheel encoders, pan and tilt actuator encoders, and the stereo camera. Using this proposed system, the stereo camera always faces the moving target. The developed system calculates the angles of the pan and tilt actuators by estimating the relative position of the target with respect to the position of the robot. The developed system estimates the target position using the robot motion information and the stereo vision information. The movement of the robot is modeled as the transformation of the frame, which consists of a rotation and a translation. The developed system calculates the rotation using 3-axis gyroscope data and the translation using robot wheel encoder data. The proposed system measures the position of the target relative to the robot, combining the encoder data of pan and tilt actuators and the disparity map of the stereo vision. The inevitable mismatch of the data, which occurs from the asynchrony of the multiple sensors, is prevented by the proposed system, which compensates for the communication latency and the computation time. The experimental results show that the developed system achieves excellent tracking performance in several motion scenarios, including combinations of straights and curves and climbing of slopes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6139204/6146827/06147522.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"639","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","doi":"10.1109/SII.2011.6147522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SII.2011.6147522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6147522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision system for mobile robots for tracking moving targets, based on robot motion and stereo vision information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Mobile robots","Robot vision systems","Actuators","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","computational complexity","gyroscopes","mobile robots","robot vision","sensors","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","moving target tracking","stereo vision information","vision-tracking","pan actuators","tilt actuators","stereo camera","robot wheel encoders","relative position estimation","robot motion information","rotation","translation","3-axis gyroscope data","disparity map","multiple sensors","communication latency","computation time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Vision system for mobile robots for tracking moving targets, based on robot motion and stereo vision information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6147522/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12542258","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision system for mobile robots for tracking moving targets, based on robot motion and stereo vision information","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"C83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076239S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6139204","isNumber":"6146827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6139204","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6146827","articleId":"6147522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6147603,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Kondo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, The University of Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37281328200"},{"name":"Junji Ueno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, The University of Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Ueno","id":"37590226800"},{"name":"Shoichiro Takao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, The University of Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoichiro","lastName":"Takao","id":"38481156500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1524-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1523-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1522-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6147603","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6147603","abstract":"A hybrid Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)-type neural network algorithm using artificial intelligence technology for medical image diagnosis is proposed and is applied to medical image diagnosis of the liver cancer.

This paper proposes a novel dual-arm motion discrimination method that combines posterior probabilities estimated independently for left and right arm movements. In this approach, the posterior probabilities of individual single-arm motions are first estimated from measured biological signals using recurrent probabilistic neural networks. Then, the estimated posterior probabilities are combined automatically based on the motion dependency that exists between the arms, making it possible to calculate the joint posterior probability of dual-arm motions. With this method, all dual-arm motions consisting of individual single-arm movements can be discriminated through learning of single-arm motions only. In the experiments performed, the proposed method was applied to the discrimination of 15 dual-arm motions made up of three movements for each arm. The results showed that the method enables high discrimination performance based on learning of only three motions for each arm (average discrimination rate: 98.80 \u00b1 0.68%).","doi":"10.1109/SII.2011.6147644","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1351","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SII.2011.6147644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146827","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6139204/6146827/06147644.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel dual-arm motion discrimination method using recurrent probability neural networks for automatic gesture recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147644/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel dual-arm motion discrimination method using recurrent probability neural networks for automatic gesture recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6147644/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12542379","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel dual-arm motion discrimination method using recurrent probability neural networks for automatic gesture recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"F72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063823S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6139204","isNumber":"6146827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6139204","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6146827","articleId":"6147644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6147649,"authors":[{"name":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","id":"37087178294"},{"name":"Yu-Tai Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Tai Tsai","id":"37087694507"},{"name":"Jeng-Da Li","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeng-Da Li","id":"37087763428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1524-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1523-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1522-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6147649","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":570},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6147649","abstract":"This paper presents a highly re-configurable Instruments-in-Matlab Software-Defined Radio (IM-SDR) platform for 4G LTE Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing (SC-FDMA) signal measurement and analysis.

ECUs need a safer and higher data-rate transmission protocol to deliver commands, statuses, and information. FlexRay is the one of alterative and provides a very high speed communication and fault-tolerant communication. The communication controller of FlexRay protocol is the core mechanism. We implement this design with Verilog HDL code. One of the most complicated parts of CC is the clock synchronization process (CSP) module. It synchronizes with other ECUs in the global time of the in-vehicle cluster by the time correction terms. The fault-tolerant midpoint algorithm is used to calculate the time correction terms from the list of the measured time values. Since the algorithm calculates the correction terms with the midpoint of the sorted list, we propose an improved systematic architecture of the sorting. We can increase the amount of sorting item very easy without redesign a full new sorting network. And it works perfectly with FlexRay.","doi":"10.1109/SII.2011.6147654","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6139204/6146827/06147654.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SII.2011.6147654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146827","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware design approach of sorting for FlexRay-based clock synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6147654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hardware design approach of sorting for FlexRay-based clock synchronization","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6147654/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12542387","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6147654/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware design approach of sorting for FlexRay-based clock synchronization","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"F91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054221S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6139204","isNumber":"6146827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6139204","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6146827","articleId":"6147654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6147663,"authors":[{"name":"Eric J.

Through machine learning, we can detect language patterns used by bullies and their victims, and develop rules to automatically detect cyber bullying content. The data we used for our project was collected from the website Formspring.me, a question-and-answer formatted website that contains a high percentage of bullying content. The data was labeled using a web service, Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

Existing BIM software tools are unable to explicitly rationalize how a building component or system selected by a designer affects the overall project with respect to building codes and regulations. This makes it difficult for the designer to determine when and how to adjust the design object in the case of design changes so that the overall project complies with the building codes. This paper outlines a framework for a collaborative building design environment where all project participants, during the design process, are able to keep track of the status of code compliance of their designs using BIM technology. The tool will assist designers in ensuring the code compliance in their designs and in exploring alternative building code-based designs during the design process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building code compliance checking using BIM technology","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2011.6148035","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135535/6147014/06148035.pdf","startPage":"3395","endPage":"3400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2011.6148035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6147014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Building code compliance checking using BIM technology","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148035/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12541736","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building code compliance checking using BIM technology","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035811S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135535","isNumber":"6147014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135535","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6147014","articleId":"6148035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6148065,"authors":[{"name":"Yilin Huang","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Group, Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["YILIN HUANG is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Systems Engineering Group of the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management of Delft University of Technology.

Each stage models dispatching and transmission decisions that are made on subsequent time periods. Certain generation decisions are made only in the first stage and the second stage realizes the actual renewable generation, where the uncertainty in renewable output is captured by a finite number of scenarios. Any resulting supply-demand mis-match must then be alleviated using extra, high marginal-cost power sources that can be tapped in short order. We propose two outer approximation algorithms to solve this nonconvex optimization problem to optimality. We show that under certain conditions the sequence of optimal solutions obtained under both alternatives has a limit point that is a globally-optimal solution to the original two-stage nonconvex program. Numerical experiments for a variety of parameter settings were carried out to indicate the efficiency and usability of this method of large practical instances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-stage non-linear program for optimal electrical grid power balance under uncertainty","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2011.6148110","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6135535/6147014/06148110.pdf","startPage":"4222","endPage":"4233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2011.6148110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6147014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A two-stage non-linear program for optimal electrical grid power balance under uncertainty","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148110/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12541811","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-stage non-linear program for optimal electrical grid power balance under uncertainty","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087445S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135535","isNumber":"6147014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135535","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6147014","articleId":"6148110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6148117,"authors":[{"name":"Si Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["SI ZHANG is a Ph.

For many approaches solving this kind of simulation optimization problems, most of the attention is on the searching mechanism. The computing efficiency problems are seldom considered and computing replications are usually equally allocated to solutions. In this paper, we integrate the notion of optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) into a simulation optimization approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to improve the efficiency of PSO. The computing budget allocation models for two versions of PSO are built and two allocation rules PSOs_OCBA and PSObw_OCBA are derived by some approximations. The numerical result shows the computational efficiency of PSO can be improved by applying these two allocation rules.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12541818","htmlLink":"/document/6148117/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulation optimization using the Particle Swarm Optimization with optimal computing budget allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation optimization using the Particle Swarm Optimization with optimal computing budget allocation","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099129S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6135535","isNumber":"6147014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6135535","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6147014","articleId":"6148117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6148123,"authors":[{"name":"Zengmao Chen","affiliation":["Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing, School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6148120/6148123/6148123-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zengmao Chen received his B.

For the first case, a power control scheme is proposed to govern the transmission power of a CR node. For the second one, a contention control scheme at the media access control (MAC) layer, based on carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), is proposed to coordinate the operation of CR nodes with transmission requests. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the interference received at a primary receiver from a CR network are first derived numerically for these two cases. For the hybrid case, where power and contention controls are jointly adopted by a CR node to govern its transmission, the interference is analyzed and compared with that of the first two schemes by simulations. Then, the interference PDFs under the first two control schemes are fitted by log-normal PDFs to reduce computation complexity. Moreover, the effect of a hidden primary receiver on the interference experienced at the receiver is investigated. It is demonstrated that both power and contention controls are effective approaches to alleviate the interference caused by CR networks. Some in-depth analysis of the impact of key parameters on the interference of CR networks is given as well.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.012012.100426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.012012.100426","startPage":"456","endPage":"468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6148120/06148123.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggregate Interference Modeling in Cognitive Radio Networks with Power and Contention Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Aggregate Interference Modeling in Cognitive Radio Networks with Power and Contention Control","volume":"60","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525165","publicationDate":"February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148123/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregate Interference Modeling in Cognitive Radio Networks with Power and Contention Control","sourcePdf":"456-tc1202-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112646S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6148123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6148125,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeongyeon Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics Limited, Yongin, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6148120/6148125/6148125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyeongyeon Kim (S'06\u2014M'10) received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, 2003 and 2007, respectively.

In frequency division duplexing, the most practical solution is to have downlink CSI from the users fed back to the BS. Most work on this feedback design has assumed independent block fading channels. However, this paper proposes a new differential feedback scheme using the observation that the channel realizations are usually temporally correlated. The sum-rate loss assuming differential feedback is analyzed for a system with the number of users K equal to the number of transmit antennas M. When K >; M, a user selection algorithm based on an approximated signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) estimation is proposed. In simulation results, the proposed differential feedback scheme increases the sum-rate compared to previous differential feedback schemes. Moreover, the proposed user selection algorithm outperforms semi-orthogonal user selection in the moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, despite requiring less feedback information. In low mobility channels, utilizing the channels' time correlation during quantization is shown to play a bigger role in determining sum-rate performance than multiuser diversity for most SNR regimes when a practical number of users is considered.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.012012.110051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6148120/06148125.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.012012.110051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148120","startPage":"578","endPage":"588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Feedback in Codebook-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems in Slowly Varying Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differential Feedback in Codebook-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems in Slowly Varying Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525167","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148125/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Feedback in Codebook-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems in Slowly Varying Channels","sourcePdf":"578-tc1202-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105041S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6148125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6148126,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Andrew Zhang","affiliation":["ICT Centre, CSIRO, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6148120/6148126/6148126-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian (Andrew) Zhang (M'04, SM'11) received the B.S. degree from Xi'an JiaoTong University, China, in 1996, the M.Sc. degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree from the Australian National University, in 2004.

Although some sidelobe cancellation and signal predistortion techniques have been proposed for spectrum shaping, they are generally not well balanced between complexity and suppression performance. In this paper, an efficient and low-complexity sidelobe suppression with orthogonal projection (SSOP) scheme is proposed. The SSOP scheme uses an orthogonal projection matrix for sidelobe suppression, and adopts as few as one reserved subcarrier for recovering the distorted signal in the receiver. Unlike most known approaches, the SSOP scheme requires multiplications as few as the number of subcarriers in the band, and enables straightforward selection of parameters. Analytical and simulation results show that more than 50dB sidelobe suppression can be readily achieved with only a slight degradation in receiver performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525168","htmlLink":"/document/6148126/","displayDocTitle":"Sidelobe Suppression with Orthogonal Projection for Multicarrier Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sidelobe Suppression with Orthogonal Projection for Multicarrier Systems","sourcePdf":"589-tc1202-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073411S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6148126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6148192,"authors":[{"name":"Guoying Zhang","affiliation":["China Academy of Telecom Research, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6449396/6148192/6148192-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guoying Zhang is a senior engineer and director engineer in transport and access network department\u2019 China Academy of Telecom Research.

Although multicast has huge potential to push the limits of next generation communication systems; it is however one of the most challenging issues currently being addressed. In this survey, we explain multicast group formation and various forms of group rate determination approaches. We also provide a systematic review of recent channel-aware multicast scheduling and resource allocation (MSRA) techniques proposed for downlink multicast services in OFDMA based systems. We study these enabling algorithms, evaluate their core characteristics, limitations and classify them using multidimensional matrix. We cohesively review the algorithms in terms of their throughput maximization, fairness considerations, performance complexities, multi-antenna support, optimality and simplifying assumptions. We discuss existing standards employing multicasting and further highlight some potential research opportunities in multicast systems.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2012.013012.00074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6449396/06148193.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2012.013012.00074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicast Scheduling and Resource Allocation Algorithms for OFDMA-Based Systems: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2013","displayDocTitle":"Multicast Scheduling and Resource Allocation Algorithms for OFDMA-Based Systems: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148193/","publicationDate":"First Quarter 2013","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13284903","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148193/","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicast Scheduling and Resource Allocation Algorithms for OFDMA-Based Systems: A Survey","sourcePdf":"14afolabi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141409S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6449396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"6449396","articleId":"6148193","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6148196,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yin","affiliation":["Information Engineering Laboratory, ICT Centre, CSIRO, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Jie Yin is a senior research scientist in the Information Engineering Laboratory at the CSIRO ICT Centre, Australia.

The BP decoders are quite simple; however, their computation-intensive and repetitive process prohibits their use in energy-sensitive applications such as sensor networks. Bit flipping-based decoding algorithms, especially implementation-efficient, reliability ratio-based, weighted bit-flipping (IRRWBF) decoding; have shown an excellent tradeoff between error-correction performance and implementation cost. In this paper, we show that with IRRWBF, iterative re-computation can be replaced by iterative selective updating. When compared with the original algorithm, simulation results show that, decoding speed can be increased by 200 to 600 percent , as the number of decoding iterations is increased from 5 to 1,000. The decoding steps are broken down into various stages such that the update operations are mostly of the single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) type. In this paper, we show that by using Intel Wireless MMX 2 accelerating technology in the proposed algorithm, the speed increased by 500 to 1,500 percent. The results of implementing the proposed scheme using an Intel/Marvell PXA320 (806 MHz) CPU are presented. The proposed scheme can be used effectively in real-time LDPC codes for energy-sensitive mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.54","startPage":"2198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6336734/06148220.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.54","endPage":"2204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6336734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel IRRWBF LDPC Decoder Based on Stream-Based Processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel IRRWBF LDPC Decoder Based on Stream-Based Processor","volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6148220/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13100415","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel IRRWBF LDPC Decoder Based on Stream-Based Processor","sourcePdf":"ttd2012122198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061902S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6336734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6336734","articleId":"6148220","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6148222,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Wu","affiliation":["Juniper Networks, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Qiang Wu received the ME degree in electronic and communication engineering from Tsinghua University, China, in 2006 and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2010.

Using our duplication algorithm, a balanced workload can be obtained and the complexity of packing tasks with different processing requirements can be reduced. By translating traffic characteristics into processing requirements, the system is able to adapt to dynamic changes in the workload and balance the utilization of all processing resources to maximize system throughput. Our approach can adapt to any traffic change in a single iteration, whereas existing adaptive approaches may require multiple steps. Results from our prototype implementation based on the Click modular router show that our system only requires on average 5.3-31.5 percent of the adaptation steps that are necessary in iterative systems. In addition, our system achieves a throughput that is 1.32 times higher than the throughput achieved with symmetric multiprocessing support with general-purpose task allocation.","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6285945/06148222.pdf","startPage":"1934","endPage":"1943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6285945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.56","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.56","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148222","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Silicon","Mercury (metals)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","multiprocessing systems","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["runtime task allocation","multicore packet processing systems","computer networks","duplication algorithm","packing task complexity","iterative systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network router","multicore processor","network processor","task allocation","scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Runtime Task Allocation in Multicore Packet Processing Systems","accessionNumber":"12961014","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148222/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Task Allocation in Multicore Packet Processing Systems","sourcePdf":"ttd2012101934.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11076S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6285945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6285945","articleId":"6148222","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6148224,"authors":[{"name":"Yanling Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yanling Yuan received the BS degree from Wuhan University of Hydraulic and Electrical Engineering, Yichang, China, in 2001, the MS degree from Wuhan University, China, in 2004, both in electrical engineering.

False data injection attack, which is against state estimation through SCADA network, has recently attracted wide research interests. This paper further develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attack, a special type of false data injection attack. The damage of LR attacks to power system operations can manifest in an immediate or a delayed fashion. For the immediate attacking goal, we show in this paper that the most damaging attack can be identified through a max-min attacker-defender model. Benders decomposition within a restart framework is used to solve the bilevel immediate LR attack problem with a moderate computational effort. Its effectiveness has been validated by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method solution in our previous work. For the delayed attacking goal, we propose a trilevel model to identify the most damaging attack and transform the model into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer problem for final solution. In summary, this paper enables quantitative analysis of the damage of LR attacks to power system operations and security, and hence provides an in-depth insight on effective attack prevention when resource budgets are limited. A 14-bus system is used to test the correctness of the proposed model and algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Analysis of Load Redistribution Attacks in Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.58","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6249676/06148224.pdf","startPage":"1731","endPage":"1738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6249676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Analysis of Load Redistribution Attacks in Power Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6148224/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12894094","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Analysis of Load Redistribution Attacks in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"ttd2012091731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058987S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6249676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6249676","articleId":"6148224","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6148229,"authors":[{"name":"Sisi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6269879/6148229/6148229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sisi Liu received the BS and MS degree in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

Typically, control messages are broadcasted on a preassigned common control channel, which can be realized as a separate frequency band in multichannel systems, a given time slot in TDMA systems, or a frequency hopping sequence (or CDMA code) in spread spectrum systems. However, a static control channel allocation is contrary to the opportunistic access paradigm. In this paper, we address the problem of dynamically assigning the control channel in CRNs based on time- and space-varying spectrum opportunities. We propose a cluster-based architecture that allocates different channels for control at various clusters in the network. The clustering problem is formulated as a bipartite graph problem, for which we develop a class of algorithms that provide different tradeoffs between two conflicting factors: number of common channels in a cluster and the cluster size. Clusters are guaranteed to have a desirable number of common channels for control, which facilitates for graceful channel migration when primary radio (PR) activity is detected, without the need for frequent reclustering. We perform extensive simulations that verify the agility of our algorithms in adapting to spatial-temporal variations in spectrum availability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269879","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1449","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6269879/06148229.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-Based Control Channel Allocation in Opportunistic Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148229/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cluster-Based Control Channel Allocation in Opportunistic Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933220","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-Based Control Channel Allocation in Opportunistic Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2012101436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103947S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6269879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6269879","articleId":"6148229","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6148231,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Mastronarde","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6464247/6148231/6148231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicholas Mastronarde received the BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, Davis, in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2011.

Existing research on this topic utilizes either physical-layer centric solutions, namely power-control and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), or system-level solutions based on dynamic power management (DPM); however, there is currently no rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing both physical-layer centric and system-level techniques to achieve the minimum possible energy consumption, under delay constraints, in the presence of stochastic and a priori unknown traffic and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose such a framework. We formulate the stochastic optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it online using reinforcement learning (RL). The advantages of the proposed online method are that 1) it does not require a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics to determine the jointly optimal power-control, AMC, and DPM policies; 2) it exploits partial information about the system so that less information needs to be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and 3) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits the adaptation speed and runtime performance of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed learning algorithms can converge up to two orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art learning algorithm for physical layer power-control and up to three orders of magnitude faster than conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6464247/06148231.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6464247","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Physical-Layer and System-Level Power Management for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Delay","Modulation","Learning","Wireless communication","Fading","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","Markov processes","optimisation","radio networks","stochastic processes","telecommunication network management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical-layer power management","system-level power management","delay-sensitive wireless communications","energy-efficient point-to-point transmission","delay-sensitive data","multimedia data","fading channel","physical-layer centric solutions","adaptive modulation and coding","dynamic power management","channel conditions","unknown traffic","Markov decision process","reinforcement learning","channel statistics","optimal power-control","Markov decision","stochastic optimization problem","traffic arrival","DPM policies","reinforcement learning algorithms","state-of-the-art learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-efficient wireless communications","dynamic power management","power-control","adaptive modulation and coding","Markov decision process","reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint Physical-Layer and System-Level Power Management for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Communications","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6148231/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13324239","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Physical-Layer and System-Level Power Management for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"ttm2013040694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085337S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6464247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6464247","articleId":"6148231","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6148234,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37859166100"},{"name":"Pubudu N.

The proposed method has the advantage that it can be applied in either stand-alone or grid-connected PV systems comprising PV arrays with unknown electrical characteristics and does not require knowledge about the PV modules configuration within the PV array. The experimental results verify that the proposed global MPP method guarantees convergence to the global MPP under any partial-shading conditions.

In real operating environment, an observed 3-D-scene hardly exhibits a homogeneous reflectance factor. Moreover, the light-beam (laser source) presents a nonuniform optical power distribution in space. Thus, the amount of the incident light on the sensor surface varies drastically from one pixel to another, and so does the signal-to-noise ratio. To address this problem, this paper investigates the impact of both scene and light-source non-ideal characteristics on the sensor performance. An adaptive on-pixel analog signal processing technique is also presented and applied to the design of a 32 \u00d7 32 complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) range camera, featuring an interesting cost-efficient solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6189422/06148248.pdf","startPage":"2320","endPage":"2327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors

This paper proposes a new framework for estimating hidden Markov models on data containing both multiple speakers and multiple languages. The proposed framework, speaker and language factorization, attempts to factorize speaker-/language-specific characteristics in the data and then model them using separate transforms. Language-specific factors in the data are represented by transforms based on cluster mean interpolation with cluster-dependent decision trees. Acoustic variations caused by speaker characteristics are handled by transforms based on constrained maximum-likelihood linear regression. Experimental results on statistical parametric speech synthesis show that the proposed framework enables data from multiple speakers in different languages to be used to: train a synthesis system; synthesize speech in a language using speaker characteristics estimated in a different language; and adapt to a new language.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12638248","volume":"20","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6148263/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis Based on Speaker and Language Factorization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis Based on Speaker and Language Factorization","sourcePdf":"tasl-zen-2187195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100213S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6176018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6176018","articleId":"6148263","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6148264,"authors":[{"name":"Robert D.

We show that for a range of slope angles during passive 2-D walking and mass distributions during controlled 3-D walking, these models have asymmetric walking patterns between the left and right legs due to the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry-breaking. In both cases a stable asymmetric family of gaits emerges from a symmetric family of gaits as the total energy increases (e.g., fast speeds). The ground reaction forces of each leg reflect different roles, roughly corresponding to support, propulsion, and motion control as proposed by the hypothesis of functional asymmetry in able-bodied human walking. These results suggest that body mechanics, independent of neurophysiological mechanisms such as leg dominance, may contribute to able-bodied gait asymmetry.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mechanics of Functional Asymmetry in Bipedal Walking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2186808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6185708/06148264.pdf","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2186808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Mechanics of Functional Asymmetry in Bipedal Walking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6148264/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12674625","pubMedId":"22328168","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mechanics of Functional Asymmetry in Bipedal Walking","sourcePdf":"tbme-gregg-2186808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104229S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6185708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6185708","articleId":"6148264","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6148266,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Chieh Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Chieh","lastName":"Huang","id":"38065545700"},{"name":"Ping-Ying Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37423058100"},{"name":"Shen-Iuan Liu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shen-Iuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280143000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6148266","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1460},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An All-Digital Jitter Tolerance Measurement Technique for CDR Circuits","abstract":"An all-digital on-chip jitter tolerance measurement technique for clock/data recovery (CDR) circuits is presented.

In this paper, an efficient resource allocation scheme based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed. Different from many existing evolutionary algorithms for solving resource allocation problems (RAPs), this PSO algorithm incorporates a novel representation of each particle in the population and a comprehensive learning strategy for the PSO search process. The novelty of this representation lies in that the position of each particle is represented by a pair of points, one on each side of the constraint hyper-plane in the problem space. The line joining these two points intersects the constraint hyper-plane and their intersection point indicates a feasible solution. With the evaluation value of the feasible solution used as the fitness value of the particle, such a representation provides an effective way to ensure the equality resource constraints in RAPs are met. Without the distraction of infeasible solutions, the particle thus searches the space smoothly. In addition, particles search for optimal solutions by learning from themselves and their neighborhood using the comprehensive learning strategy, helping prevent premature convergence and improve the solution quality for multimodal problems. This new algorithm is shown to be applicable to both single-objective and multiobjective RAPs, with performance validated by a number of benchmarks and by a real-world bed capacity planning problem. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148273/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13146846","htmlLink":"/document/6148273/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Scheme Using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Scheme Using Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-zhang-2185052-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144883S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6362272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6362272","articleId":"6148273","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6148283,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Adamatzky","affiliation":["University of the West of England, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Andrew Adamatzky is a Professor in Unconventional Computing in the Department of Computer Science, director of the Unconventional Computing Centre, University of the West of England, Bristol, U.K. He does research in reaction-diffusion computing, cellular automata, physarum computing, massive parallel computation, applied mathematics, collective intelligence, and robotics."]},"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Adamatzky","id":"38306776100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1241"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2639"}],"articleNumber":"6148283","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":709},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Laboratories","Chemicals","Oscillators","Navigation","Substrates","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","biology computing","microorganisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slime mold","chemo-attractants","Physarum polycephalum","plasmodium","protoplasmic tubes","maze-solving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maze","Physarum computing","shortest path","slime mold"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Avena sativa","Chemotaxis","Computer Simulation","Information Science","Models, Biological","Physarum polycephalum"]}],"abstract":"Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large cell, visible by unaided eye, which exhibits sophisticated patterns of foraging behaviour.

One technique is the precise control of air/fuel ratio, which requires the measurement of instantaneous fuel consumption. Measurement accuracy and repeatability for fuel rate is the key to successfully controlling the air/fuel ratio and real-time measurement of fuel consumption. The volumetric and gravimetric measurement principles are well-known methods for measurement of fuel consumption in internal combustion engines. However, the fuel flow rate measured by these methods is not suitable for either real-time control or real-time measurement purposes because of the intermittent nature of the measurements. This paper describes a technique that can be used to find the minimum data [consisting of data from just 2.5% of the non-road transient cycle (NRTC)] to solve the problem concerning discontinuous data of fuel flow rate measured using an AVL 733S fuel meter for a medium or heavy-duty diesel engine using neural networks. Only torque and speed are used as the input parameters for the fuel flow rate prediction. Power density analysis is used to find the minimum amount of the data. The results show that the nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs could predict the particulate matter successfully with R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n above 0.96 using 2.5% NRTC data with only torque and speed as inputs.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2183887","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6163421/06148284.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"595","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2183887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Data Requirement for Neural Networks Based on Power Spectral Density Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Data Requirement for Neural Networks Based on Power Spectral Density Analysis","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571539","pubMedId":"24805042","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148284/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Data Requirement for Neural Networks Based on Power Spectral Density Analysis","sourcePdf":"tnnls-deng-2183887-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080243S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6163421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6163421","articleId":"6148284","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6148286,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6184677/6148286/6148286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Faa-Jeng Lin (M'93\u2013SM'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1983 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1993.","From 1993 to 2001, he was an Associate Professor and then a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan.

Initially, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy parabolic PDE model is proposed to accurately represent the nonlinear parabolic PDE system. Then, based on the T-S fuzzy PDE model, a novel distributed fuzzy P-sD state feedback controller is developed by combining the PDE theory and the Lyapunov technique, such that the closed-loop PDE system is exponentially stable with a given decay rate. The sufficient condition on the existence of an exponentially stabilizing fuzzy controller is given in terms of a set of spatial differential linear matrix inequalities (SDLMIs). A recursive algorithm based on the finite-difference approximation and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques is also provided to solve these SDLMIs. Finally, the developed design methodology is successfully applied to the feedback control of the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo equation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Control design","Fuzzy control","State feedback","Equations","Algorithm design and analysis","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","distributed control","finite difference methods","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","parabolic equations","partial differential equations","PD control","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed proportional-spatial derivative control","fuzzy PDE modeling approach","partial differential equations","distributed fuzzy control design","exponential stabilization","parabolic partial differential equations","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy parabolic PDE model","nonlinear parabolic PDE system","state feedback controller","Lyapunov technique","closed-loop PDE system","decay rate","sufficient condition","spatial differential linear matrix inequalities","recursive algorithm","finite-difference approximation","Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exponential stability","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)","spatially distributed systems (SDSs)","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy model"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Decision Support Techniques","Feedback","Fuzzy Logic","Models, Theoretical","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2185046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6198838/06148292.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2185046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Proportional\u2013Spatial Derivative Control of Nonlinear Parabolic Systems via Fuzzy PDE Modeling Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Proportional\u2013Spatial Derivative Control of Nonlinear Parabolic Systems via Fuzzy PDE Modeling Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148292/","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148292/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12713273","pubMedId":"22328181","dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Proportional\u2013Spatial Derivative Control of Nonlinear Parabolic Systems via Fuzzy PDE Modeling Approach","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-wu-2185046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131831S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6198838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6198838","articleId":"6148292","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6148295,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

However, the statistical properties of these models, such as underfitting or overfitting given sets of data, are still not well characterized in the literature. As a result, the success of sparse modeling depends on hand-tuning critical parameters for each data and application. This work aims at addressing this by providing a practical and objective characterization of sparse models by means of the minimum description length (MDL) principle-a well-established information-theoretic approach to model selection in statistical inference. The resulting framework derives a family of efficient sparse coding and dictionary learning algorithms which, by virtue of the MDL principle, are completely parameter free. Furthermore, such framework allows to incorporate additional prior information to existing models, such as Markovian dependencies, or to define completely new problem formulations, including in the matrix analysis area, in a natural way. These virtues will be demonstrated with parameter-free algorithms for the classic image denoising and classification problems, and for low-rank matrix recovery in video applications. However, the framework is not limited to this imaging data, and can be applied to a wide range of signal and data types and tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2187203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2187203","endPage":"2927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6198804/06148296.pdf","startPage":"2913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An MDL Framework for Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148296/","displayDocTitle":"An MDL Framework for Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning","volume":"60","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"12725058","dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148296/","publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MDL Framework for Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning","sourcePdf":"tsp-ramirez-2187203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133561S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6198804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6198804","articleId":"6148296","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6148299,"authors":[{"name":"Chunshan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6169213/6148299/6148299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunshan Liu received the B.S. degree in physics in 2007 from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, and the M.Sc.

The motion-induced channel time variations can be modeled by sampling the transmitter/receiver trajectory at the signal sampling rate and calculating, for each position, the channel impulse response from the acoustic-field computation. This approach, however, would result in high complexity. To reduce the complexity, the channel impulse response is calculated for fewer (waymark ) positions and then interpolated by local splines to recover it at the signal sampling rate. To allow higher distances between waymarks and, thus, further reduction in the complexity, the multipath delays are appropriately adjusted before the interpolation. Because, for every time instant, this method only requires local information from the trajectory, the impulse response can recursively be computed, and therefore, the signal transmission can be modeled for arbitrarily long trajectories. An approach for setting the waymark sampling interval is suggested and investigated. The proposed method is verified by comparing the simulated data with data from real ocean experiments. For a low-frequency shallow-water experiment with a moving source that transmits a tone set, we show that the Doppler spectrum of the received tones is similar in the simulation and experiment. For a higher frequency deep-water experiment with a fast-moving source that transmits orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals, we investigate the detection performance of a receiver and show that it is similar in the simulation and experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6169213/06148299.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2187226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2187226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doubly Selective Underwater Acoustic Channel Model for a Moving Transmitter/Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Splines (mathematics)","Computational modeling","Underwater acoustics","Receivers","Trajectory","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly selective underwater acoustic channel model","signal transmission","underwater acoustic communications","motion-induced channel","transmitter-receiver trajectory","acoustic-field computation","channel impulse response","multipath delays","low-frequency shallow-water experiment","high frequency deep-water experiment","OFDM","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing communication signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["B-spline","channel modeling","channel simulator","Doppler spread","local splines","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","underwater acoustic communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Doubly Selective Underwater Acoustic Channel Model for a Moving Transmitter/Receiver","volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6148299/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592460","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doubly Selective Underwater Acoustic Channel Model for a Moving Transmitter/Receiver","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2187226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135833S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6169213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6169213","articleId":"6148299","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6148303,"authors":[{"name":"Brady Benware","affiliation":["Silicon Test Solutions group, Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Brady Benware is an engineering director in the Silicon Test Solutions group at Mentor Graphics with responsibility for debug, diagnosis and yield learning related products.

When a new manufacturing process is introduced, or a new product is introduced on a mature manufacturing process, yields will tend to be significantly lower than acceptable. The ability to meet profitability and quality objectives, and perhaps more importantly, time-to-market and time-to-volume objectives depend greatly on the rate at which these low yields can be ramped up.

Driver's drowsy state monitoring system has been implicated as a causal factor for the safety driving issue, especially when the driver fell asleep or distracted in driving. However, the difficulties in developing such a system are lack of significant index for detecting the driver's drowsy state in real-time and the interference of the complicated noise in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. In our past studies, we found that the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum changes were highly correlated with the driver's behavior performance especially the occipital component. Different from presented subject-dependent drowsy state monitor systems, whose system performance may decrease rapidly when different subject applies with the drowsiness detection model constructed by others, in this study, we proposed a generalized EEG-based Self-organizing Neural Fuzzy system to monitor and predict the driver's drowsy state with the occipital area. Two drowsiness prediction models, subject-dependent and generalized cross-subject predictors, were investigated in this study for system performance analysis. Correlation coefficients and root mean square errors are showed as the experimental results and interpreted the performances of the proposed system significantly better than using other traditional Neural Networks ( \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n-value <;0.038).

The detector supports signal detection of multiple MIMO modes, which are spatial-multiplexing (SM), spatial-diversity (SD), and space-division-multiple-access (SDMA). Area-efficiency is achieved by algorithm and architecture co-design where low-complexity, near-maximum-likelihood (ML) detection algorithms are proposed for these three MIMO modes respectively while keeping in mind that the operations can be reused among different modes. A parallel multistage VLSI architecture is accordingly developed that achieves high detection throughput and run-time reconfigurability. To further improve the implementation efficiency, the detector also adopts an orthogonal-real-value-decomposition (ORVD) aided candidate-sharing technology for low-cost partial Euclidean distance calculation and a distributed interference cancelation scheme for a critical path delay reduction.

Before it can be employed successfully, loop delay errors must be estimated and compensated accurately. In this paper, the effect of loop delay errors on LUT predistortion is analyzed. It is shown that LUTs fluctuations happen to both amplitude and phase tables. Then, a novel loop delay estimation algorithm, with a high degree of robustness and accuracy, is presented. To further improve the robustness of LUT predistortion to loop delay errors, the smoothing filter (SMF) method to polish LUTs fluctuations is proposed here. LUT predistortion can suffer bigger loop delay errors because of the proposed SMF method, but retains good linearization performance close to the optimal one. The performance of the proposed loop delay estimation algorithm is investigated by comparative study with a state-of-the-art algorithm. Its robustness is also demonstrated under a noisy feedback path by simulations. The effectiveness of the SMF method is assessed by both simulations and experiments. Comparison among different predistortion systems is also presented. The results clearly show that the proposed techniques are useful for LUT predistortion.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2185332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6313475/06148314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2185332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313475","startPage":"2432","endPage":"2442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Robustness of Look-Up Table Digital Predistortion in the Presence of Loop Delay Error","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Robustness of Look-Up Table Digital Predistortion in the Presence of Loop Delay Error","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030617","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148314/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Robustness of Look-Up Table Digital Predistortion in the Presence of Loop Delay Error","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liu-2185332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078567S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6313475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6313475","articleId":"6148314","onlineDate":"07 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6148316,"authors":[{"name":"Erin M.

The proposed ECC cryptoprocessor was modeled using VHDL and synthesized on Actel IGLOO AGLN250V2-VQFP100 Nano FPGA. The synthesis results show that the targeted Nano FPGA can not exceed the values of m \u2264 11 bits. This is because of the limited number of resources available on Nano FPGAs, which opens a new challenging opportunity for future Nano FPGAs to satisfy the needs of critical portable applications.

More precisely, digital certificate binds a public key with the identity of its owner. However, significant overhead is associated with managing digital certificates. For this reason, the new notion called \u201cidentity-based public key cryptography\u201d (ID-PKC) in which bitstring of user identity (could be name, email addresses, etc) is directly being the public key. The private key generator (PKG) is responsible for creating users private keys according to their public keys (identities). As a result, the need of certificates is eliminated because the authenticity of the public key is highly achieved. On the other hand, key escrow issue exists since PKG is able to find (calculate) any user's private key. Can you imagine what a malicious or compromised PKG can do? In order to overcome this issue a new paradigm which is certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) is introduced in which the private key is partially determined by the key generating centre (KGC).

For instance, contents, services and applications previously executed locally or on a local network are gradually finding its way to the cloud. As people and environment changes, so must education in order to be able to adapt and embrace to this paradigm shift in the educational landscape. Cloud-based education has thus arisen and has since gathered a lot of interests in the recent years. This paper thus describes the issues that need to be solved in order to arrive at cloud education, including integration, ownership, security and assessment, and offers a holistic approach to cloud education. It also put forward a new perspective in embedding mobile cloud education, an amalgamation between cloud-learning and mobile-learning domains, within a holistic intelligent campus environment.","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/6141531/6148349/06148426.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148349","startPage":"718","endPage":"723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Education beyond the cloud: Anytime-anywhere learning in a smart campus environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Education beyond the cloud: Anytime-anywhere learning in a smart campus environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148426/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540148","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148426/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Education beyond the cloud: Anytime-anywhere learning in a smart campus environment","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"S16ISeCeSeG4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105256S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6141531","isNumber":"6148349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6141531","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6148349","articleId":"6148426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICITST","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6148443,"authors":[{"name":"Amr Sayed Abdel Fattah","affiliation":["Higher colleges of technology, Khalifa Bin Zayed Air college, Al-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Amr Sayed","lastName":"Abdel Fattah","id":"38352590900"},{"name":"Salwa Elramly","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Salwa","lastName":"Elramly","id":"37284145600"},{"name":"Magdy Ibrahim","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37332539700"},{"name":"Ahmed Abdel-Hafez","affiliation":["Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Abdel-Hafez","id":"38329861700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-908320-00-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0884-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6148443","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Chaotic communication","Wavelet transforms","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","numerical analysis","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["denoising algorithm","wavelet transform","comprehensive study","chaotic communication system","Lorenz noisy chaotic signal","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos","Communication system security","Noise","Wavelet transforms"]}],"abstract":"Although a significant amount of research has been given to wavelet transform as a denoising technique, little has been done to apply new approach to chaotic noisy signal and most of them have a lack of details and they do not discuss the results on a complete chaotic communication system.

A detailed study for Lorenz chaotic signal is applied in order to obtain the optimal denoising parameters including the threshold selection rule, wavelet form, the threshold rescaling methods, and wavelet decomposition level. The validity of this approach is verified by numerical simulations.

In addition, insulators used in high voltage dc transmission lines are designed to have increased creepage distance to mitigate the tracking and erosion problems. ASTM D2303 standard gives a procedure for finding the tracking and erosion resistance of outdoor polymeric insulator weathershed material samples under laboratory conditions for ac voltages. In this paper, inclined plane (IP) tracking and erosion tests similar to ASTM D2303 were conducted under both positive and negative dc voltages for silicone rubber samples filled with micron and nano sized particles to understand the phenomena occurring during such tests. Micron sized Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) and nano sized alumina fillers were added to silicone rubber matrix to improve the resistance to tracking and erosion. The leakage current during the tests and the eroded mass at the end of the tests were monitored. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive Xray (EDX) studies were conducted to understand the filler dispersion and the changes in surface morphology in both nanocomposite and microcomposite samples. The results suggest that nanocomposites performed better than microcomposites even for a small filler loading (4%) for both positive and negative dc stresses. It was also seen that the tracking and erosion performance of silicone rubber is better under negative dc as compared to positive dc voltage. EDX studies showed migration of different ions onto the surface of the sample during the IP test under positive dc which has led to an inferior performance as compared to the performance under negative dc.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/6148493/06148506.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2012.6148506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2012.6148506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking and erosion of silicone rubber nanocomposites under DC voltages of both polarities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strontium","IP networks","Polymers","Electrodes","Loading","Rubber"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alumina","corrosion resistance","filled polymers","HVDC power transmission","leakage currents","matrix algebra","nanocomposites","nanoparticles","power transmission lines","scanning electron microscopy","silicone rubber insulators","surface morphology","X-ray chemical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicone rubber nanocomposite erosion performance","DC voltage","polymeric silicone rubber insulator","HV power transmission line","micron sized inorganic filler","SR matrix","high voltage DC transmission line","creepage distance","ASTM D2303 standard","erosion resistance","polymeric insulator weathershed material sample","AC voltage","inclined plane tracking performance","erosion testing","micron sized particle","nanosized particle","micron sized alumina trihydrate","nanosized alumina filler dispersion","silicone rubber matrix","leakage current","eroded mass","scanning electron microscopy","energy dispersive X-ray study","surface morphology","microcomposite sample","small filler loading","positive DC stress","negative DC stress","IP test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HVDC transmission","polymeric outdoor insulators","silicone rubber","nano fillers","nanocomposites","inclined plane test"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2012","displayDocTitle":"Tracking and erosion of silicone rubber nanocomposites under DC voltages of both polarities","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6148506/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537126","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking and erosion of silicone rubber nanocomposites under DC voltages of both polarities","sourcePdf":"p0091-vas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057333S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"6148493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6148493","articleId":"6148506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6148508,"authors":[{"name":"Roman Kochetov","affiliation":["High Voltage and Management Group, Delft University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/6148493/6148508/6148508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roman Kochetov was born in 1984 in Kazakhstan (USSR).

The surface of the nanoparticles was modified with a silane coupling agent, in order to make them compatible with the organic host and create a system with homogeneously dispersed filler material. Morphological characterizations of individual particles and fabricated composites were performed by means of transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The present research addresses an analysis of the complex permittivity. The relative permittivity of nanocomposites shows an unusual behaviour. Introduction of a low percentage of high permittivity filler results in a decrease of the permittivity of the bulk polymer material. We propose a qualitative explanation for the reduction of the relative permittivity, compared to the reference samples. The interface layer of surface modified particles plays a more important role than the nature of the particles themselves. The immobilization caused by the surface treatment of the nanoparticles seems to be the main factor determining the relative permittivity of the composites with fillgrade below 5 wt.%. The imaginary part of the complex permittivity, which represents the dielectric losses in the system, does not change significantly with addition of nanofiller up to 5 wt.%.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2012.6148508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/6148493/06148508.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2012.6148508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous behaviour of the dielectric spectroscopy response of nanocomposites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148508/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous behaviour of the dielectric spectroscopy response of nanocomposites","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537128","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148508/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous behaviour of the dielectric spectroscopy response of nanocomposites","sourcePdf":"p0107-kochetov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089956S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"6148493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6148493","articleId":"6148508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6148524,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio R.

Artificial Neural Networks are used to approach operational conditions assessment issue of the insulating oil in power transformers, which is characterized by a non-linear dynamic behavior. The operation conditions and integrity of a power transformer can be inferred by analysis of physicochemical and chromatographic (DGA - Dissolved Gas Analysis) profiles of the isolating oil, which allow establishing procedures for operating and maintaining the equipment. However, while the costs of physicochemical tests are less expensive, the chromatographic analysis is more informative and reliable. This work presents a method that can be used to extract chromatographic information using physicochemical analysis through Artificial Neural Networks. It's believed that, the power utilities could improve reliability in the prediction of incipient failures at a lower cost with this method. The results show this strategy might be promising. The purpose of this work is the direct implementation of the diagnosis of incipient faults through the use of physicochemical properties without the need to make an oil chromatography.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148524/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12537144","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6148524/","publicationDate":"February 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of an artificial neural network in the use of physicochemical properties as a low cost proxy of power transformers DGA data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an artificial neural network in the use of physicochemical properties as a low cost proxy of power transformers DGA data","sourcePdf":"p0239-barbosa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090456S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"6148493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6148493","articleId":"6148524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6148529,"authors":[{"name":"Yongchun Liang","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Information, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/6148493/6148529/6148529-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Yongchun (S'07\u2212M'09) was born in Hebei, China in 1971.

Between the outer surface of the cable and inner surface of the duct, there are three heat transfer modes, thermal conduction, thermal natural convection and thermal radiation. A Streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilized finite element method is proposed to solve the air governing formulas including the mass conservation equation, the momentum conservation equation and the energy conservation equation in the region between the cables and the containment ducts. During the numerical thermal field analysis, the Newton-Raphson iteration method is used to solve the weak electromagnetic-thermal coupling of underground power cable systems. The radiation heat exchange between the outer surface of the cable and inner surface of the duct is solved by the Newton-Raphson iteration method too. An experiment with several holes and three cables was conducted and the test results were compared with the results of analytical method and SUPG finite element method. The comparison reveals that the convection induced heat exchange is much stronger than the conduction induced heat exchange in the air between the outer cable surface and inner duct surface and calculation accuracy of SUPG finite element method is better than the analytical method. Finally, the Newton-Raphson iteration method is used to evaluate the ampacity of power cable systems placed in PVC ducts.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2012.6148529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/6148493/06148529.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2012.6148529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-state thermal analysis of power cable systems in ducts using streamline-upwind/petrov-galerkin finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148529/","displayDocTitle":"Steady-state thermal analysis of power cable systems in ducts using streamline-upwind/petrov-galerkin finite element method","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537149","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148529/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-state thermal analysis of power cable systems in ducts using streamline-upwind/petrov-galerkin finite element method","sourcePdf":"p0283-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10779S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"6148493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6148493","articleId":"6148529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6148615,"authors":[{"name":"Paul J.

It can be assumed that, compared to sailing at full speed, a speed reduction has a positive economic and also environmental impact. This paper is focused on the economic aspects.

For each SNR between 0dB and 50dB the BER value showed an effect of AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel on the MC-CDMA system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/6140628/6148690/06148708.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development","doi":"10.1109/SCOReD.2011.6148708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCOReD.2011.6148708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user MC-CDMA using Walsh code for Rayleigh and Gaussian channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Rayleigh channels","OFDM","AWGN channels","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","code division multiple access","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MC-CDMA","Walsh code","Rayleigh channel","Gaussian channel","multicarrier code division multiple access systems","wireless communication","MC-CDMA system performance","AWGN channel","fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","MC-CDMA","AWGN","Rayleigh","multi carrier","spreader","Walsh code","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user MC-CDMA using Walsh code for Rayleigh and Gaussian channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148708/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12542403","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user MC-CDMA using Walsh code for Rayleigh and Gaussian channel","confLoc":"Cyberjaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034225S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6140628","isNumber":"6148690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6140628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6148690","articleId":"6148708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6148710,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd Zain Ismail","affiliation":["Wireless Research Laboratory, Universiti Kuala Lumpur British Malaysian Institute, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Zain","lastName":"Ismail","id":"38064094600"},{"name":"Ali Abdul Halim","affiliation":["Universiti Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, MY"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Abdul Halim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0102-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0101-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6148710","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Frequency domain analysis","Channel estimation","Receivers","Blind equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","fast Fourier transforms","intersymbol interference","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guard interval less","parallel transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM system","Long Term Evolution","packet transmission","IFFT","frequency equalizer","intersymbol interference","interchannel interference","quality of service","physical layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GI","GI-less","parallel packet transmission","IFFT","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposed a Guard Interval Less (GI-less) transmission on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for Long Term Evolution (LTE).

In this paper, an improved model of Ant Colony System is developed in optimizing DNA sequences design. The proposed model suggests that each artificial ant represents a possible solution of the DNA sequences design problem. This differs from the previous Ant Colony System approached where a number of artificial ants are required to represent a possible solution. In the implementation, four objective measures and two constraint measures are employed to obtain a good set of DNA sequences. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing the result with existing Ant Colony System model and other published sequence design method. The experimental result shows that the proposed Ant Colony System model outperformed the existing Ant Colony System model.","doi":"10.1109/SCOReD.2011.6148729","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/6140628/6148690/06148729.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCOReD.2011.6148729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148690","startPage":"169","endPage":"173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified computational model of ant colony system in DNA sequence design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A modified computational model of ant colony system in DNA sequence design","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148729/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12542423","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148729/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified computational model of ant colony system in DNA sequence design","confLoc":"Cyberjaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082839S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6140628","isNumber":"6148690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6140628","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6148690","articleId":"6148729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6148731,"authors":[{"name":"Durbadal Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Durbadal","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37408356700"},{"name":"Dibbendu Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Dibbendu","lastName":"Roy","id":"38237267100"},{"name":"Rajib Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Rajib","lastName":"Kar","id":"37411564000"},{"name":"Sakti Prasad Ghoshal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Sakti Prasad","lastName":"Ghoshal","id":"37408158500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0102-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0101-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6148731","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148731","abstract":"In many applications it is desirable to have the maximum radiation of an array directed normal to the axis of the array (Broadside radiation).

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are well suited for CR optimization problems to improve spectrum utilization by manipulating its unused portions and offer a solution to the apparent spectrum underutilization problem. In this paper, we present binary genetic algorithm (BGA) and continuous genetic algorithm (CGA)-based soft decision fusion (SDF) scheme for cooperative spectrum optimization in cognitive radio network (CRN). Then BGA-based optimization engine is implemented at the fusion center (FC) of a linear SDF scheme to optimize the linear coefficient vector with other conventional methods. The comparison between BGA and CGA shows that BGA performs better than CGA. Then the results and analysis confirm that BGA is efficient and stable and it outperforms conventional natural deflection coefficient- (NDC), modified deflection coefficient- (MDC-), maximal ratio combining- (MRC-) and equal gain combining- (EGC-) based SDF schemes as well as the OR-rule based hard decision fusion (HDF) scheme. It also verifies that the computation complexity of the BGA method meets the real time requirements of cognitive radio spectrum sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12542441","htmlLink":"/document/6148747/","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A comparison between binary and continuous genetic algorithm for collaborative spectrum optimization in cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison between binary and continuous genetic algorithm for collaborative spectrum optimization in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Cyberjaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058744S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6140628","isNumber":"6148690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6140628","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6148690","articleId":"6148747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6148764,"authors":[{"name":"Sangeeta Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engg.

In most parts of the world, cellular network bands are overloaded, but amateur radio and paging frequencies are not. Independent studies performed in some countries confirmed that observation, and concluded that spectrum utilization depends strongly on time and place. Moreover, fixed spectrum allocation prevents rarely used frequencies (those assigned to specific services) from being used by unlicensed users, even when their transmissions would not interfere at all with the assigned service. In this research we studied the frequency usage pattern of a large telecom company to identify the possibility of establishing a cognitive radio network using their licensed band.

The particle swarm is used to choose optimal Haar features for constructing weak classifiers within AdaBoost. This algorithm is trained using the Japanese Female Facial Expression dataset and tested on the Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded Face Expression Database. The results show some improvement in accuracy over AdaBoost as well as a reduction in duplicated weak classifiers. In particular, the time taken for training was dramatically reduced from an average of 106 minutes and 41 seconds to a mere 4 minutes and 39 seconds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148799/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12539994","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148799/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimisation based AdaBoost for facial expression classification of still images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimisation based AdaBoost for facial expression classification of still images","confLoc":"Queenstown, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060426S","chronDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6141506","isNumber":"6148790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6141506","xplore-issue":"6148790","articleId":"6148799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6148810,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Setayesh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Setayesh","id":"37680788300"},{"name":"Mengjie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mengjie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406631900"},{"name":"Mark Johnston","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Johnston","id":"37671050900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9631-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9629-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-2205"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-2191"}],"articleNumber":"6148810","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Detectors","Educational institutions","Equations","Manuals","Optimization","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image coding","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","particle swarm optimisation","objective function","encoding scheme","Canny algorithm","Gaussian-based edge detector","figure of merit measure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AI approaches to computer vision","edge detection","particle swarm optimisation","Canny edge detection","noise","edge linking techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148810","abstract":"Traditional edge detection approaches often result in broken edges especially in noisy images.

Despite the fact that dermoscopy is a very specialized technique, in some practical situations, patients do not have a fast access to an specialist. In this situations, pre-screening systems can be used to evaluate a suspect skin lesion by a non-specialist, and lesion segmentation is very important for the success of such systems. This paper proposes a new method for segmenting pigmented skin lesions on macroscopic images acquired with standard cameras. Our method is simpler than comparable methods proposed for dermoscopy, and our experiments based on publicly available datasets of pigmented skin lesion images show promising results. Our approach can achieve an average segmentation error of 24.85%, which is better than the accuracy of comparable methods available in the literature (even for illumination corrected images).","doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2010.6148845","publicationTitle":"2010 25th International Conference of Image and Vision Computing New Zealand","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 25th International Conference of Image and Vision Computing New Zealand","pdfPath":"/iel5/6141506/6148790/06148845.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2010.6148845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148790","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pigmented skin lesion segmentation on macroscopic images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pigmented skin lesion segmentation on macroscopic images","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148845/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"12540040","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6148845/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pigmented skin lesion segmentation on macroscopic images","confLoc":"Queenstown, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055781S","chronDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6141506","isNumber":"6148790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6141506","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6148790","articleId":"6148845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6148878,"authors":[{"name":"Dean Sutton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Dean","lastName":"Sutton","id":"38242496600"},{"name":"Richard Green","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Green","id":"37416879500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9631-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9629-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-2205"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-2191"}],"articleNumber":"6148878","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":735},"abstract":"Stereo vision is a computationally expensive process that limits accurate real time performance. However, this is usually due to large resolutions in high end cameras. When low cost web cameras are exchanged for high resolution cameras, a practical real time stereo system can achieve real time performance. The accuracy of the disparity (depth) data depends strongly on the stereo camera calibration and rectification. Chessboards that have landscape orientations, which take at least 50% of the physical image size in a camera and move across the horizontal axis between sample views, give the best data for Levenberg-Marquardt iterative stereo camera calibration algorithm and Bougeut's stereo rectification algorithm to converge to an accurate result. Our research, using a 7\u00d77 SAD window correspondence algorithm with a modern PC, generates approximately 8 frames per second with a sequential single thread programming model. The frame rate of our system provides reasonably real time response; however, the accuracy of depth data limits the number of applications. Therefore, applications that require detecting relative distances rather than absolute distances between objects, such as wheelchair navigation around buildings, could be equipped with our stereo vision system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 25th International Conference of Image and Vision Computing New Zealand","pdfPath":"/iel5/6141506/6148790/06148878.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2010 25th International Conference of Image and Vision Computing New Zealand","doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2010.6148878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2010.6148878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6148878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of real time stereo vision system using web cameras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Calibration","Stereo vision","Mathematical model","Real time systems","Optical distortion","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","iterative methods","real-time systems","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time stereo vision system","Web cameras","Levenberg-Marquardt iterative stereo camera calibration algorithm","Bougeut's stereo rectification algorithm","sequential single thread programming model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stereo image processing","real-time stereo vision system","OpenCV","stereo vision","web camera calibration","web camera rectification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6148878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of real time stereo vision system using web cameras","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6148878/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"12540073","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of real time stereo vision system using web cameras","confLoc":"Queenstown, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055649S","chronDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6141506","isNumber":"6148790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6141506","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6148790","articleId":"6148878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6148913,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Abdul Basith","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed Abdul","lastName":"Basith","id":"37062807700"},{"name":"Tariq Ahmad","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Tariq","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"38232162400"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Rossi","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Sud, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37567087400"},{"name":"Maciej Ciesielski","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Ciesielski","id":"37282519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9835678-1-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0896-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6148913","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Logic gates","Integrated circuit modeling","Adders","Vectors","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","digital arithmetic","electronic engineering computing","formal verification","invertors","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic approach","arithmetic design verification","functional verification","arithmetic circuit","half adder","full adder","inverter","linear equation","functional correctness","algebraic signature","standard LP solver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Formal verification","Equivalence checking","Arithmetic bit level","SMT"]}],"abstract":"The paper describes an algebraic approach to functional verification of arithmetic circuits specified at bit level.

In this paper we present a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) approach for Cloud Computing Services.

Its inter-connectivity enables long-distance transmission of power for more efficient system operation. The same inter-connectivity, however, also allows the propagation of disturbances. In fact, blackouts due to cascading failures occur because of the intrinsic electrical properties of this propagation and physical mechanisms that are triggered by it. In this paper we propose a stochastic Markov model, whose transition probabilities are derived from a stochastic model for the flow redistribution, that can potentially capture the progression of cascading failures and its time span. We suggest a metric that should be monitored to expose the risk of failure and the time margin that is left to perform corrective action. Finally we experiment with the proposed stochastic model on the IEEE 300 bus system and provide numerical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markov-Transition Model for Cascading Failures in Power Grids","publicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2012.63","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/6148328/6148595/06149269.pdf","startPage":"2115","endPage":"2124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2012.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Markov-Transition Model for Cascading Failures in Power Grids","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149269/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12540770","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markov-Transition Model for Cascading Failures in Power Grids","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4525c115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139271S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6148328","isNumber":"6148595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6148328","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6148595","articleId":"6149269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6149270,"authors":[{"name":"Bertrand Haut","affiliation":["Tractebel Engineering S.A., Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Haut","id":"37550364800"},{"name":"Valeriu Savcenco","affiliation":["Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Valeriu","lastName":"Savcenco","id":"38234032600"},{"name":"Patrick Panciatici","affiliation":["RTE-DMA, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Panciatici","id":"37270842300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4525-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"6149270","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slabs","Tin","Accuracy","Power system stability","Estimation","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","differential equations","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain simulation","very large power systems","power systems time evolution","differential equations","algebraic equations","numerical time integration methods","power system topology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149270","abstract":"The time evolution of power systems is modeled by systems of differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) [8].

Despite initial positive results, it is challenging in theory and practice to find an appropriate provider matching the individual requirements of a company or a government. Moreover, the number of new entrants as well as non-transparent service offers, which sometimes differ significantly, make it difficult to migrate into the Cloud. Due to the lack of adequate possibilities to compare and classify Cloud providers we are presenting in this paper a provider independent classification framework for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) which can be used in e-Government. For this purpose, the target dimensions for Cloud Computing from a customer perspective were defined, based on expert interviews and an international literature review. The relevance of the target dimensions was evaluated with an additional survey conducted among IT managers. Extended by a provider market analysis the classification framework was designed and finally checked for applicability and can be used to create concrete cloud procurement processes, refine Cloud strategies or develop migration requirements for governments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reference Guide to Cloud Computing Dimensions: Infrastructure as a Service Classification Framework","publicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2012.76","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/6148328/6148595/06149278.pdf","startPage":"2178","endPage":"2188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2012.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Reference Guide to Cloud Computing Dimensions: Infrastructure as a Service Classification Framework","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149278/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12540777","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reference Guide to Cloud Computing Dimensions: Infrastructure as a Service Classification Framework","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4525c178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10677S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6148328","isNumber":"6148595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6148328","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6148595","articleId":"6149278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6149291,"authors":[{"name":"Hafedh Chourabi","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Laval, Canada"],"firstName":"Hafedh","lastName":"Chourabi","id":"38367262400"},{"name":"Taewoo Nam","affiliation":["State University of New York, Albany, USA"],"firstName":"Taewoo","lastName":"Nam","id":"37401186200"},{"name":"Shawn Walker","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Shawn","lastName":"Walker","id":"37391296900"},{"name":"J.

Yet little academic research has sparingly discussed the phenomenon. To close the gap in the literature about smart cities and in response to the increasing use of the concept, this paper proposes a framework to understand the concept of smart cities. Based on the exploration of a wide and extensive array of literature from various disciplinary areas we identify eight critical factors of smart city initiatives: management and organization, technology, governance, policy context, people and communities, economy, built infrastructure, and natural environment. These factors form the basis of an integrative framework that can be used to examine how local governments are envisioning smart city initiatives. The framework suggests directions and agendas for smart city research and outlines practical implications for government professionals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149291/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12540788","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149291/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Smart Cities: An Integrative Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Smart Cities: An Integrative Framework","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4525c289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108324S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6148328","isNumber":"6148595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6148328","citationCount":"829","xplore-issue":"6148595","articleId":"6149291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":6149298,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Morris","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Morris","id":"37290260600"},{"name":"Rayford Vaughn","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, USA"],"firstName":"Rayford","lastName":"Vaughn","id":"37329074900"},{"name":"Yoginder Dandass","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yoginder","lastName":"Dandass","id":"37275908300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4525-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"6149298","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1654},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149298","abstract":"MODBUS RTU/ASCII Snort is software to retrofit serial based industrial control systems to add Snort intrusion detection and intrusion prevention capabilities.

Cloud computing provides many benefits in terms of low cost and accessibility of data. Ensuring the security of cloud computing is a major factor in the cloud computing environment, as users often store sensitive information with cloud storage providers but these providers may be untrusted. Dealing with \"single cloud\" providers is predicted to become less popular with customers due to risks of service availability failure and the possibility of malicious insiders in the single cloud. A movement towards \"multi-clouds\", or in other words, \"interclouds\" or \"cloud-of-clouds\" has emerged recently. This paper surveys recent research related to single and multi-cloud security and addresses possible solutions. It is found that the research into the use of multi-cloud providers to maintain security has received less attention from the research community than has the use of single clouds. This work aims to promote the use of multi-clouds due to its ability to reduce security risks that affect the cloud computing user.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/6148328/6148595/06149560.pdf","startPage":"5490","endPage":"5499","publicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2012.153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2012.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing Security: From Single to Multi-clouds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Security","Protocols","Clouds","Computational modeling","Availability","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing security","multicloud security","cloud storage providers","single cloud providers","service availability failure","malicious insiders","interclouds","cloud-of-clouds","single cloud security","security risk reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","single cloud","multi-clouds","cloud storage","data integrity","data intrusion","service availability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing Security: From Single to Multi-clouds","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149560/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12541009","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing Security: From Single to Multi-clouds","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4525f490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118415S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6148328","isNumber":"6148595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6148328","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6148595","articleId":"6149560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6149561,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Takabi","affiliation":["School of Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Takabi","id":"37595441000"},{"name":"James B.D.

On the other hand, cloud computing can help enable security controls to be delivered in new ways by service providers. To this end, we need frameworks for efficient delivery of cloud-based security services and for provisioning desirable solutions to customers based on their requirements. In this paper, we focus on policy management systems in cloud environments. Currently, users must use diverse access control solutions available for each cloud service provider to secure data. Access control policies may be composed in incompatible ways because of diverse policy languages that are maintained separately at every cloud provider. Heterogeneity and distribution of these policies pose problems in managing access policy rules for a cloud environment. In this paper, we introduce Policy Management as a Service (PMaaS), a cloud based policy management framework that is designed to give users a unified control point for managing access policies to control access to his resources no matter where they are stored. We present the framework and describe its components and protocols needed for various components to communicate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/6148328/6148595/06149561.pdf","startPage":"5500","endPage":"5508","publicationTitle":"2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2012.475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2012.475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Policy Management as a Service: An Approach to Manage Policy Heterogeneity in Cloud Computing Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Authorization","Organizations","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["policy management as a service","policy heterogeneity management","cloud computing environment","security issue","security control","service provider","cloud-based security service","cloud environment","cloud service provider","access control policies","diverse policy language","cloud based policy management framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["access control","heterogeneity","cloud computing","policy management","policy management as a service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Policy Management as a Service: An Approach to Manage Policy Heterogeneity in Cloud Computing Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149561/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12541010","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Policy Management as a Service: An Approach to Manage Policy Heterogeneity in Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4525f500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063729S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6148328","isNumber":"6148595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6148328","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6148595","articleId":"6149561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6149591,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Stuhlsatz","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, SMS Siemag AG, Dusseldorf, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6163421/6149591/6149591-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andr\u00e9 Stuhlsatz received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany, in 2010.","Since 2011, he has been a Development Manager for instrumentation with SMS Siemag AG, D\u00fcsseldorf.

As for LDA, discriminative features generated from independent Gaussian class conditionals are assumed. This modeling has the advantages that the intrinsic dimensionality of the feature space is bounded by the number of classes and that the optimal discriminant function is linear. Unfortunately, linear transformations are insufficient to extract optimal discriminative features from arbitrarily distributed raw measurements. The generalized discriminant analysis (GerDA) proposed in this paper uses nonlinear transformations that are learnt by DNNs in a semisupervised fashion. We show that the feature extraction based on our approach displays excellent performance on real-world recognition and detection tasks, such as handwritten digit recognition and face detection. In a series of experiments, we evaluate GerDA features with respect to dimensionality reduction, visualization, classification, and detection. Moreover, we show that GerDA DNNs can preprocess truly high-dimensional input data to low-dimensional representations that facilitate accurate predictions even if simple linear predictors or measures of similarity are used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12571540","pubMedId":"24805043","htmlLink":"/document/6149591/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Feature Extraction With Deep Neural Networks by a Generalized Discriminant Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Extraction With Deep Neural Networks by a Generalized Discriminant Analysis","sourcePdf":"tnnls-stuhlsatz-2183645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115429S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6163421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6163421","articleId":"6149591","onlineDate":"08 February 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6149607,"authors":[{"name":"Basil Sh.

Different studies stated that the water level of the DS is dropping an average of 3 feet per year. Accordingly there is a need to provide accurate and reliable estimates for the water level to help the researchers and geologists of the DS to make different kind of studies giving results. This achieved by a applying three Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms for the meteorological data recorded from different stations and resources inside and outside of Jordan, The models are trained and tested by BackPropagation (BP), Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M), and Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) and the results of models are verified with untrained data. The results from the different algorithms are compared with each other. The criteria of performance evaluation are calculated in order to evaluate and compare the performances of models. Finally, we can say that the proposed GRNN model provides best significant performance results comparing with other NN models using Mean Square Error (MSE).","doi":"10.1109/ISIICT.2011.6149610","startPage":"147","endPage":"154","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Innovations in Information and Communications Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6142532/6149592/06149610.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Innovations in Information and Communications Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIICT.2011.6149610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of the Dead Sea water level using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Signal processing algorithms","Vectors","Neurons","Jacobian matrices","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","geology","geophysics computing","hydrology","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dead sea water level prediction","regional economic development","artificial neural network","ANN algorithm","meteorological data","backpropagation","BP","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","L-M","generalized regression neural network","GRNN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of the Dead Sea water level using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149610/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12540461","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of the Dead Sea water level using neural networks","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"1Papers18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048185S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6142532","isNumber":"6149592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6142532","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6149592","articleId":"6149610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6149768,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed F.

This paper presents a new approach for modeling rainfall forecasting using the artificial neural network technique (ANN). Daily actual data from the years 2007 to 2010, collected from 3 main stations in Selangor, were used to develop the ANN model. Intended to provide near real time forecasting, different network types with different hidden neurons were tested. Preliminary tests show that a Feed-Forward Back propagation ANN model using a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function achieved the most accurate rainfall forecasting. Sets of data consisting of meteorological parameters (wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, cloudiness and air pressure) were used as inputs and rainfall collected by rain gauges at selected stations were used as the target. The results for rainfall forecast were fed into a SCADA-based system as a solution for preventing flash floods.","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2011.6149841","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference on High-capacity Optical Networks and Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6139203/6149763/06149841.pdf","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference on High-capacity Optical Networks and Emerging Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2011.6149841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rainfall forecasting using an artificial neural network model to prevent flash floods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Forecasting","Training","Irrigation","Data models","Floods","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floods","geophysics computing","hydrological techniques","rain","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rainfall forecasting","artificial neural network model","flash floods","natural disaster","property damage","AD 2007 to 2010","Selangor","real time forecasting","feed-forward back propagation ANN model","hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function","meteorological parameters","SCADA-based system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","flash floods","SCADA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rainfall forecasting using an artificial neural network model to prevent flash floods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149841/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12542149","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rainfall forecasting using an artificial neural network model to prevent flash floods","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"paper62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066695S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6139203","isNumber":"6149763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6139203","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6149763","articleId":"6149841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6149930,"authors":[{"name":"Jitendra Virmani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Virmani","id":"38235135000"},{"name":"Vinod Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Vinod","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38190116600"},{"name":"Naveen Kalra","affiliation":["Department of Radiodiagnosis and Imaging, PGIMER-Chandigarh, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Kalra","id":"38242209100"},{"name":"Niranjan Khandelwal","affiliation":["Department of Radiodiagnosis and Imaging, PGIMER-Chandigarh, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Niranjan","lastName":"Khandelwal","id":"38242451700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2186-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6149930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149930","abstract":"In this present work, a technique for discrimination between normal and cirrhotic liver segmented regions of interest (SROIs) based on singular value decomposition (SVD) of GLCM matrix is reported. Thirty four B-mode ultrasound images taken from 22 normal volunteers and 12 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis were collected from Department of Radio diagnosis and Imaging, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. Firstly, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features are computed for 121 SROIs (82 normal SROIs, 39 cirrhotic SROIs) and classification is done using a neural network (NN) classifier. The classification accuracy of 95.86% is achieved without feature selection. Secondly, feature selection is carried out by two different approaches. In approach 1, standard correlation based feature selection (CFS) is used to find the optimal subset of GLCM texture features which provides best discrimination between normal and cirrhotic SROIs. It has been observed that CFS method,results in an optimal subset of 7 GLCM texture features {angular second moment (ASM), Contrast, Variance, Sum Average, Entropy, Difference Entropy and Information Measures of Correlation-1}. In approach 2, the potential of singular values obtained by singular value decomposition (SVD) of GLCMs for discrimination between normal and cirrhotic SROIs is investigated. It has been observed that only first 2 singular values can provide effective discrimination between normal and cirrhotic liver SROIs. In the classification stage a neural network (NN) classifier is used. The classification accuracy of 95.04% is obtained in both cases. From the comparison it is concluded that only first two singular values obtained by SVD decomposition of the GLCMs and a NN classifier can be used to build acomputationally efficient computer aided diagnostic (CAD) system for predicting liver cirrhosis.","doi":"10.1109/DeSE.2011.56","startPage":"146","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Developments in E-systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6149621/6149928/06149930.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Developments in E-systems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DeSE.2011.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Cirrhosis Based on Singular Value Decomposition of Gray Level Co-occurence Marix and aNneural Network Classifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Liver","Accuracy","Matrix decomposition","Artificial neural networks","Entropy","Support vector machine classification","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["liver","medical image processing","neural nets","patient diagnosis","singular value decomposition","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cirrhosis prediction","singular value decomposition","gray level co-occurence matrix","neural network classifier","cirrhotic liver","segmented regions of interest","SROI","SVD","GLCM matrix","B-mode ultrasound images","liver cirrhosis","Department of Radio diagnosis and Imaging","PGIMER","Chandigarh","India","standard correlation based feature selection","GLCM texture features","angular second moment","ASM","contrast","variance","sum average","difference entropy","information measures of correlation","computer aided diagnostic","CAD system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["singular value decomposition (SVD)","correlation based feature selection (CFS)","gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)","liver cirrhosis","neural network (NN)","B-mode ultrasound image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Cirrhosis Based on Singular Value Decomposition of Gray Level Co-occurence Marix and aNneural Network Classifier","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149930/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12543623","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Cirrhosis Based on Singular Value Decomposition of Gray Level Co-occurence Marix and aNneural Network Classifier","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"4593a146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096928S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6149621","isNumber":"6149928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6149621","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6149928","articleId":"6149930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6149943,"authors":[{"name":"Sufyan T.

In this paper FrFT is used as an alternative for pulse compression of received echo signals in coded excitation ultrasound imaging. Using field II program, axial resolution of match filter and FrFT, as two methods of pulse compression, are compared. Simulation results show that applying FrFT with synthetic transmit aperture lead to about 15dB improvement in discrimination ability of two close reflectors for various depth and central frequency of excitation signals. It is worthwhile noting that, in addition to this improvement, no computational complexity imposed for pulse compression. Using Wigner-Ville distribution, it is shown that the proposed method is more robust than match filter against the frequency dependent attenuation in medium.","doi":"10.1109/DeSE.2011.100","publicationTitle":"2011 Developments in E-systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Developments in E-systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6149621/6149928/06149957.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DeSE.2011.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Axial Resolution and Robustness Improvement in Coded Excitation Ultrasound Images Using Fractional Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149957/","displayDocTitle":"Axial Resolution and Robustness Improvement in Coded Excitation Ultrasound Images Using Fractional Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12556279","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149957/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Axial Resolution and Robustness Improvement in Coded Excitation Ultrasound Images Using Fractional Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"4593a068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116887S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6149621","isNumber":"6149928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6149621","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6149928","articleId":"6149957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6149973,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Mahram","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Mahram","id":"38232368200"},{"name":"Mehdi Chehel Amirani","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi Chehel","lastName":"Amirani","id":"37713899600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2186-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6149973","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Complexity theory","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","cognitive radio","entropy","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["criterion complexity","blind spectrum sensing","cognitive radio technology","unlicensed secondary user","interference","primary users","sample entropy","approximate entropy","spectral entropy","Shannon entropy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sample Entropy (SampEn)","Cognitive Radio","Blind Spectrum Sensing","False Alarm"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing is one of the most important issues in cognitive radio technology. It is because the unlicensed secondary user, to avoid interference, after detecting licensed primary users, should leave the spectrum or move to another idle spectrum resource. Considering the fact that received signal in terms of presence or absence of the primary user has different complexity. In this paper, a new algorithm for detection of primary users is presented. Our proposed method is based on Sample entropy which is criterion for time series complexity. This kind of measurement of spectrum due to lack of need to preliminary information through the channel, primary user and noise variance, is called blind spectrum sensing. In simulation section, it is shown that for sufficiently large data lengths, this method in comparison with similar methods like approximate entropy, spectral entropy and Shannon entropy has a better performance.","doi":"10.1109/DeSE.2011.62","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Developments in E-systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6149621/6149928/06149973.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DeSE.2011.62","publicationTitle":"2011 Developments in E-systems Engineering","startPage":"444","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Complexity as a Criterion for Blind Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6149973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Complexity as a Criterion for Blind Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6149973/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6149973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12543664","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Complexity as a Criterion for Blind Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"4593a444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07741S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6149621","isNumber":"6149928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6149621","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6149928","articleId":"6149973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6149977,"authors":[{"name":"A.
