Because of the limitation of communication capacity, only a limited number of controller-plant connections can be accommodated at any time instant. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully determine a scheduling policy so as to achieve a simultaneous stabilization for all these control loops. A sufficient condition on the existence of such a scheduling policy is presented for a collection of networked LTI systems with sampled-data controllers and uncertain network-induced delays. The proof for the schedulability condition is in a constructive way, which can also serve as a systematic method to design a scheduling policy. Finally, a scheduling-and-feedback-control codesign procedure is proposed for the simultaneous stabilization of the collection of networked LTI systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed codesign procedure is demonstrated with simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5357527/04837630.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"78","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2008.2010459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2008.2010459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5357527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4837630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling-and-Control Codesign for a Collection of Networked Control Systems With Uncertain Delays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Networked control systems","Delay systems","Communication system control","Control systems","Job shop scheduling","Open loop systems","Actuators","Digital communication","Sensor systems","Communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","control engineering computing","delays","digital communication","feedback","sampled data systems","scheduling","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling-and-control codesign","networked control systems","uncertain delays","simultaneous stabilization","continuous-time linear time-invariant plants","feedback-control loops","shared digital communication network","scheduling policy","networked LTI systems","sampled-data controllers","uncertain network-induced delays","schedulability condition","scheduling-and-feedback-control codesign"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average dwell time","codesign","networked control systems (NCSs)","scheduling","switched systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4837630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling-and-Control Codesign for a Collection of Networked Control Systems With Uncertain Delays","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4837630/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024531","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling-and-Control Codesign for a Collection of Networked Control Systems With Uncertain Delays","sourcePdf":"tcst-dai-2010459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105686S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5357527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5357527","articleId":"4837630","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4837771,"authors":[{"name":"Ai Hui Tan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ai Hui","lastName":"Tan","id":"37340600700"},{"name":"Keith R.

Our approach is based on the use of shadow gates, whose task it is to protect the primary gate in case it is struck by a heavy cosmic ion. We locally duplicate the gate to be protected, and connect a pair of diode-connected transistors (or diodes) between the outputs of the original and shadow gates. These transistors turn on when the voltages of the two gates deviate during a radiation strike. Our experiments show that at the level of a single gate, our circuit structure has a delay overhead about 1.76% on average, and an area overhead of 277%. At the circuit level, however, we do not need to protect all gates. We present a methodology to selectively protect specific gates of the circuit in a manner that guarantees radiation tolerance for the entire circuit. With this methodology, we demonstrate that at the circuit level, the average delay overhead is about 3% and the average placed-and-routed area overhead is 28%, compared to an unprotected circuit (for delay mapped designs). We also propose an improved circuit protection algorithm to reduce the area overhead associated with our approach. With this approach for circuit protection, the area and delay overheads are further lowered.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2006795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4957542/04837774.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2006795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957542","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4837774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-Level Design Approaches for Radiation-Hard Digital Electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4837774/","displayDocTitle":"Circuit-Level Design Approaches for Radiation-Hard Digital Electronics","volume":"17","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4837774/","publicationDate":"June 2009","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664181","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit-Level Design Approaches for Radiation-Hard Digital Electronics","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-khatri-2006795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13686S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4957542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4957542","articleId":"4837774","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4837869,"authors":[{"name":"Pierantonio Merlino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Management and Mechanical Engineering, University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Pierantonio","lastName":"Merlino","id":"38109438800"},{"name":"Antonio Abramo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Management and Mechanical Engineering, University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Abramo","id":"37322526500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4837869","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compression algorithms","Image coding","Pipelines","Transform coding","Decoding","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Circuits","Wearable computers","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","pipeline arithmetic","remote sensing","wearable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-pipelined architecture","LOCO-I compression algorithm","JPEG-LS standard","field-programmable gate-array realization","wearable computers","remote sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) implementation","JPEG-LS","LOCO-I","lossless compression","pipeline"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design of a novel architectural implementation of the LOCO-I compression scheme, the lossless/near-lossless algorithm used inside the JPEG-LS standard.

One major step of ASD decoding is the interpolation. Available interpolation algorithms can only add interpolation points or increase interpolation multiplicities. However, backward interpolation, which eliminates interpolation points or reduces interpolation multiplicities, is indispensable to enable the reusing of interpolation results in the following two scenarios: 1) interpolation needs to be carried out on multiple test vectors, which share common entries and 2) iterative ASD decoding where interpolation points have decreasing multiplicities. Examples for these cases are the low-complexity chase (LCC) decoding and bit-level generalized minimum distance (BGMD) decoding. With lower complexity, these algorithms can achieve similar or higher coding gain than other practical ASD algorithms. In this paper, we propose novel backward interpolation schemes and corresponding efficient implementation architectures for LCC and BGMD decoding through constructing equivalent GrOumlbner bases. The proposed architectures share computational units with forward interpolation architectures. Hence, the area overhead for incorporating the backward interpolation is very small. Substantial area saving or speedup can be achieved by using the backward interpolation. When the proposed architecture is applied to the LCC decoding of a (255, 239) RS code with eta = 3, the area is reduced to 39% of those required by prior architectures. In terms of speed/area ratio, the proposed architecture is 48% more efficient than the best available architecture. For the BGMD decoding of the same code, the proposed architecture can achieve around 20% higher efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4837873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","volume":"17","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10929470","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4837873/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Backward Interpolation Architecture for Algebraic Soft-Decision Reed\u2013Solomon Decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backward Interpolation Architecture for Algebraic Soft-Decision Reed\u2013Solomon Decoding","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-zhu-2005575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131244S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5290268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5290268","articleId":"4837873","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4838117,"authors":[{"name":"Hatem A.

For large data sets, the computational demands for classifying patterns using KNN can be prohibitive. A way to alleviate this problem is through the condensing approach. This means we remove patterns that are more of a computational burden but do not contribute to better classification accuracy. In this brief, we propose a new condensing algorithm. The proposed idea is based on defining the so-called chain. This is a sequence of nearest neighbors from alternating classes. We make the point that patterns further down the chain are close to the classification boundary and based on that we set a cutoff for the patterns we keep in the training set. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively reduces the number of prototypes while maintaining the same level of classification accuracy as the traditional KNN. Moreover, it is a simple and a fast condensing algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838117/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601766","pubMedId":"19389693","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Template Reduction Approach for the <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula>-Nearest Neighbor Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Template Reduction Approach for the <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula>-Nearest Neighbor Method","sourcePdf":"tnn-aatiya-2018547.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148751S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4897624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4897624","articleId":"4838117","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4838651,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi D.

Our study begins by considering a conventional low-speed optically amplified lightwave receiver and study its performance in ultrahigh-speed regime and show its substantially degraded behavior, indicating the need to use advance optical nonlinear elements such as SHG prior to photodetection. In studying SHG effects, we begin by discussing the mathematical models of thin and thick SHG crystals in the context of statistical digital lightwave communication systems. In the case of thin SHG crystals and in the regime of high-speed digital systems, where Gaussian assumption is not necessarily valid, we use advanced numerical simulation based on Monte Carlo simulation to obtain its corresponding performance. However, for thick SHG crystals by invoking an advanced theorem due to Papoulis on Gaussianity approximation and a lemma due to Turin, we obtain the moment generating function of the sampled output with which, we obtain its corresponding performance using saddle point approximation method. Finally in our performance analysis, we consider electronically induced thermal noise and sketch the performance for various system parameters. The results in this paper indicate that the use of SHG crystals can enhance the system performance, when compared with the conventional receiver, by a substantial amount, i.e., five orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we highlight the existence of an optimum length for thick SHG crystals in the presence of thermal and optical amplifier noise.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical harmonic generation","Mathematical model","Statistical analysis","Crystals","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Optical receivers","High speed optical techniques","Communication systems","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","digital communication","high-speed optical techniques","Monte Carlo methods","optical harmonic generation","optical materials","optical noise","optical receivers","photodetectors","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second harmonic generation effect","thick SHG crystals","thin SHG crystals","ultrahigh-speed communication system","optically amplified digital lightwave communication system","photodetector","low-speed optically amplified lightwave receiver","optical nonlinear element","Monte Carlo simulation","Gaussianity approximation","Papoulis","saddle point approximation method","electronically induced thermal noise","system performance enhancement","optical amplifier noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lightwave communication systems","optical thin and thick crystals","periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN)","second harmonic generation (SHG)","ultrahigh-speed detection scheme","ultrashort light pulse"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2008030","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5170198/04838651.pdf","startPage":"3438","endPage":"3452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2008030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical Modeling and Statistical Analysis of Second Harmonic Generation Effects With Thin and Thick Crystals in Ultrahigh-Speed Optically Amplified Digital Lightwave Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical Modeling and Statistical Analysis of Second Harmonic Generation Effects With Thin and Thick Crystals in Ultrahigh-Speed Optically Amplified Digital Lightwave Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838651/","volume":"27","issue":"16","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4838651/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10812262","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical Modeling and Statistical Analysis of Second Harmonic Generation Effects With Thin and Thick Crystals in Ultrahigh-Speed Optically Amplified Digital Lightwave Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-salehi-2008030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059846S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5170198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5170198","articleId":"4838651","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838786,"authors":[{"name":"Mable P.

Six multicast channels each operating at 20 Gb/s are obtained at a 200-GHz spacing, resulting in a 120 Gb/s throughput. Widely opened eye diagrams are obtained in the detection of both the ASK and DPSK components of the multicast channels. Bit error rate measurements have also been performed for both the amplitude and the phase of the signals.

It is shown that a simple linear receiver processing is sufficient to perfectly demultiplex the two transmitted streams and to perfectly compensate for group velocity dispersion (GVD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD). In addition, in the presence of a strong phase noise of the lasers at the transmitter and receiver, a symbol-by-symbol detector with decision feedback is able to considerably improve the receiver robustness with a limited complexity increase. We will also discuss the channel estimation and the receiver adaptivity to time-varying channel conditions as well as the problem of the frequency acquisition and tracking. Finally, a new two-dimensional (polarization/time) differential encoding rule is proposed to overcome a polarization-ambiguity problem. In the numerical results, the receiver performance will be assessed versus the receiver complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5133707/04838792.pdf","startPage":"2357","endPage":"2369","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2008821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2008821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5133707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Multilevel Coherent Optical Systems With Linear Processing at the Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Robustness","Optical transmitters","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Optical feedback","Optical modulation","Phase shift keying","Polarization mode dispersion","Laser feedback","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel estimation","laser noise","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre polarisation","optical receivers","optical transmitters","phase noise","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust multilevel coherent optical system","polarization multiplexing","high-order modulation","phase-shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulations","linear receiver processing","demultiplexing","group velocity dispersion","polarization mode dispersion","laser phase noise","symbol-by-symbol detector","decision feedback","receiver robustness","channel estimation","time-varying channel condition","differential encoding rule","frequency acquisition","frequency tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrical equalization","group velocity dispersion (GVD)","intersymbol interference (ISI)","optical coherent transmission systems","phase-shift keying (PSK)","polarization mode dispersion (PMD)","quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Multilevel Coherent Optical Systems With Linear Processing at the Receiver","volume":"27","issue":"13","htmlLink":"/document/4838792/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10733070","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Multilevel Coherent Optical Systems With Linear Processing at the Receiver","sourcePdf":"jlt-forestieri-2008821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136456S","chronDate":"July1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5133707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5133707","articleId":"4838792","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838793,"authors":[{"name":"Natalia Y.

An improved finite-difference beam propagation method for solving the modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation is applied for the first time in the counterpropagation regime. In our model, group velocity dispersion, two-photon absorption, ultrafast nonlinear refraction, and the change in the gain peak wavelength with carrier density are included, which have not been considered simultaneously in previous counterpropagation models. The model is applied to demonstrate how a subpicosecond and picosecond probe pulse shape and spectrum can be modified by a counterpropagating pump pulse. Based on the results obtained by this model, while subpicosecond probe pulses can be compressed by in this scheme, their time-bandwidth product are also improved significantly. Furthermore, the effects of several parameters are analyzed to obtain the proper probe spectral peak shift using counterpropagating probe pulses. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the new scheme are assessed through numerical examples and are shown to be superior to previously published approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838794/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10798619","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"15","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Finite-Difference Time-Dependent Beam Propagation Model of Counterpropagating Picosecond Pulses in a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Finite-Difference Time-Dependent Beam Propagation Model of Counterpropagating Picosecond Pulses in a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","sourcePdf":"jlt-razaghi-2008823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074829S","chronDate":"Aug.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5153581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5153581","articleId":"4838794","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4838800,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Teimouri","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Teimouri","id":"37283080900"},{"name":"Nasser Rezaee","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Rezaee","id":"37282311500"},{"name":"Ahmadreza Hedayat","affiliation":["Navini Networks, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmadreza","lastName":"Hedayat","id":"37269735600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4838800","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Concatenated codes","Block codes","Decoding","Modulation coding","Fading","Channel state information","Receiving antennas","Error analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","channel coding","concatenated codes","error statistics","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability bounds","concatenated channel codes","differential space-time block codes","multiple-antenna systems","channel state information","bit error rate","frame error rate","block Rayleigh fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit and frame error probabilities","channel codes","channel state information","space-time block codes","trellis coded modulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838800","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2021340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2021340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4967994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4967994/04838800.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Probability Bounds of Concatenated Channel Codes and Differential Space-Time Block Codes","abstract":"In this letter, we analyze the performance of a class of multiple-antenna systems which concatenate channel codes, e.g., trellis coded modulation (TCM), and differential orthogonal space-time block codes (DOSTBC).

Key to the architecture is a proposed capacitive coupling approach for aiding lamp ignition. A dc voltage is applied to the lamp electrodes while an ac voltage is applied to an external plate for capacitive coupling. The result is reliable, simultaneous ignition of parallel lamps with a required applied dc voltage near the lamp steady-state operating voltage. The complete system architecture includes a single high voltage converter, a pulse lamp ignition circuit, current control circuits and a single backlight controller. The topology is capable of driving a large number of parallel lamps with independent lamp current regulation, while avoiding ac coupling losses in steady-state operation and achieving significant reduction in reactive components when compared to typical high frequency ac ballast designs. Experimental results are presented for a system of four parallel 250 mm length lamps, demonstrating simultaneous parallel lamp ignition and dc current regulation.","doi":"10.1109/JDT.2009.2015778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2009.2015778","startPage":"152","endPage":"161","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/9425/4810191/04838805.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4810191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Frequency Architecture for Multi-Lamp CCFL Systems With Capacitive Ignition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low Frequency Architecture for Multi-Lamp CCFL Systems With Capacitive Ignition","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4838805/","accessionNumber":"10587495","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838805/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Frequency Architecture for Multi-Lamp CCFL Systems With Capacitive Ignition","sourcePdf":"jdt-doshi-2015778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067884S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"4810191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4810191","articleId":"4838805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838812,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4838810/4838812/4838812-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Xu (S'98\u2013M'05) received the M.S. and B.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2000 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2004.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago.

As this problem worsens for nanoscale IC technologies, the high cost of design and multiple manufacturing spins causes fewer products to have the volume required to support full-custom implementation. Design reuse and analog synthesis make analog/RF design more affordable; however, the increasing process variability and lack of modeling accuracy remain extremely challenging for nanoscale analog/RF design. We propose a regular analog/RF IC using metal-mask configurability design methodology Optimization with Recourse of Analog Circuits including Layout Extraction (ORACLE), which is a combination of reuse and shared-use by formulating the synthesis problem as an optimization with recourse problem. Using a two-stage geometric programming with recourse approach, ORACLE solves for both the globally optimal shared and application-specific variables. Furthermore, robust optimization is proposed to treat the design with variability problem, further enhancing the ORACLE methodology by providing yield bound for each configuration of regular designs. The statistical variations of the process parameters are captured by a confidence ellipsoid. We demonstrate ORACLE for regular Low Noise Amplifier designs using metal-mask configurability, where a range of applications share common underlying structure and application-specific customization is performed using the metal-mask layers. Two RF oscillator design examples are shown to achieve robust designs with guaranteed yield bound.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Integrated circuit synthesis","Design optimization","Uncertainty","Analog integrated circuits","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Noise robustness","Silicon","Product development","Integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric programming","integrated circuit design","low noise amplifiers","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog/RF integrated circuits design","optimization","ellipsoidal uncertainty","nanoscale IC technologies","analog synthesis","process variability","metal-mask configurability design","layout extraction","two-stage geometric programming","statistical variations","low noise amplifier","application-specific customization","RF oscillator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Configurable design","optimization with recourse","robustness","statistical optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2013996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4838810/04838812.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4838810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2013996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regular Analog/RF Integrated Circuits Design Using Optimization With Recourse Including Ellipsoidal Uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Regular Analog/RF Integrated Circuits Design Using Optimization With Recourse Including Ellipsoidal Uncertainty","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838812/","volume":"28","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4838812/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10587633","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regular Analog/RF Integrated Circuits Design Using Optimization With Recourse Including Ellipsoidal Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tcad-xu-2013996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107681S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4838810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4838810","articleId":"4838812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4838816,"authors":[{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petre","lastName":"Stoica","id":"37277401700"},{"name":"Hao He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"He","id":"37309701000"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4838816","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar applications","Councils","Algorithm design and analysis","Virtual reality","US Government","Information technology","Application software","Pulse compression methods","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","radar signal processing","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulse-like correlations","radar","communication applications","aperiodic correlation case","aperiodic case","periodic correlations","arbitrary sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic algorithm","periodic correlation","sequence design"]}],"abstract":"Sequences with impulse-like correlations are at the core of several radar and communication applications.

By using the suitable parameters, for instance, input soliton power, coupling coefficients, and ring radii, the short-wave and millimeter-wave output signals can be simultaneously generated and filtered in a single system. Such a system consists of two microring resonators and a nanoring resonator that can be integrated to be a single system. Initially, the large bandwidth signal is generated by using a soliton pulse within a Kerr-type nonlinear medium, whereas the signals with broad bandwidth or wavelength can be generated. Results obtained have shown the potential of using the technique for a broad light spectra generation, where the required filtering signals are allowed to form the simultaneous up-link and down-link conversion using two different frequency (wavelength) carriers within a single system.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2009.2020803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/5071727/04838818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2009.2020803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071727","startPage":"932","endPage":"934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simultaneous Short-Wave and Millimeter-Wave Generation Using a Soliton Pulse Within a Nano-Waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simultaneous Short-Wave and Millimeter-Wave Generation Using a Soliton Pulse Within a Nano-Waveguide","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"13","publicationDate":"July1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10772551","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838818/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simultaneous Short-Wave and Millimeter-Wave Generation Using a Soliton Pulse Within a Nano-Waveguide","sourcePdf":"lpt-pyupapin-2020803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047013S","chronDate":"July1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5071727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5071727","articleId":"4838818","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838820,"authors":[{"name":"Sungtae Kim","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Lab (B715), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungtae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37069747300"},{"name":"Jemin Lee","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Lab (B715), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jemin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406236800"},{"name":"Hano Wang","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Lab (B715), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hano","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405989900"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Lab (B715), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4838820","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1156},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Chromium","Fading","Cognitive radio","Performance analysis","Diversity reception","Information technology","Degradation","Numerical simulation","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","correlation methods","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detector sensing performance","correlated multiple antennas","false-alarm probability","cognitive radio networks","antenna correlation","performance analysis","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","correlated multiple antennas","energy detector","spectrum sensing"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the derivation of detection and false-alarm probabilities for energy detectors in cognitive radio networks when a sensing node of the secondary system has correlated multiple antennas.

For circuits without reconvergent fan-outs, an optimal solution for the voltage assignment is guaranteed; for circuits with reconvergent fan-outs, a near-optimal solution is obtained. We then generate a level shifter for each net that connects two blocks in different voltage domains and perform power-network-aware floorplanning for the MSV design.

Applications can be found in the domain of low-power design, optical computing, and quantum computing. In the past, several approaches have been introduced that synthesize reversible networks with respect to a given function. Most of these methods only approximate a minimal network representation. In this paper, exact algorithms for the synthesis of multiple-control Toffoli networks are presented, i.e., algorithms that guarantee to find a network with the minimal number of gates. Our iterative algorithms formulate the synthesis problem as a sequence of decision problems. The decision problems are encoded as Boolean satisfiability (SAT) or SAT modulo theory (SMT) instances, respectively. As soon as one of these instances becomes satisfiable, a Toffoli network representation for the given function has been found. We show that choosing the encoding for synthesis is crucial for the resulting runtimes. Furthermore, we discuss the principal limits of the SAT and SMT approaches. To overcome these limits, we propose a method using problem-specific knowledge during synthesis. In addition, better embeddings to make irreversible functions reversible are considered. For the resulting synthesis problems, an improvement is presented that reduces the overall runtime by automatically setting the constant inputs to their optimal values. Experimental results on a large set of benchmarks demonstrate the differences between three exact synthesis algorithms. In addition, a comparison with the best-known heuristic results is provided. In summary, the results show that, for some benchmarks, the heuristic approaches have already found the minimal network, while for other benchmarks, significantly smaller networks exist.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2017215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4838810/04838823.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2017215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4838810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact Multiple-Control Toffoli Network Synthesis With SAT Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838823/","displayDocTitle":"Exact Multiple-Control Toffoli Network Synthesis With SAT Techniques","volume":"28","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10587639","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4838823/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Multiple-Control Toffoli Network Synthesis With SAT Techniques","sourcePdf":"tcad-grosse-2017215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15806S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4838810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4838810","articleId":"4838823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838826,"authors":[{"name":"Yohei Sakamaki","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Sakamaki","id":"37300741900"},{"name":"Yusuke Nasu","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Nasu","id":"37307666500"},{"name":"Toshikazu Hashimoto","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshikazu","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37266621100"},{"name":"Kuninori Hattori","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kuninori","lastName":"Hattori","id":"37303457400"},{"name":"Yasuyuki Inoue","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuyuki","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37278802900"},{"name":"Hiroshi Takahashi","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37278586200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4838826","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"A 43-Gb/s differential quadrature phase-shift keying demodulator is demonstrated with a wide operation range enhanced by birefringence control achieved by using stress release grooves.

However, since additional resources (time or frequency slots) and overhead are required to perform relaying, the addition of relays into a cellular system must be carefully designed for the system's specific geometry, topology, and propagation environment. Maximizing the benefit of multihop relaying requires that the medium access control (MAC) layer scheduler be aware of physical (PHY) layer conditions. Multihop relaying increases networkwide throughput by enabling spatial reuse within a cell and by significantly reducing the path loss on each hop. The most significant gain results from adding enough relays to create line-of-sight (LOS) paths on all relay hops. To assist with system design, we present a methodology of analyzing network throughput and area-averaged spectral efficiency for multihop relay-enhanced cellular systems, including cross-layer considerations. In addition, we describe a technique that may be used to determine spatial reuse schedules. In this paper, we use a realistic model and typical cellular scenarios to show how relaying can be used to improve coverage and throughput in a real-world system. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021180","startPage":"4514","endPage":"4528","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04838856.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Design and Throughput Analysis for Multihop Relaying in Cellular Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System analysis and design","Throughput","Relays","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency","Geometry","Network topology","Media Access Protocol","Physical layer","Cellular networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cellular radio","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular system","wireless multihop relaying","medium access control","MAC layer scheduler","cross-layer design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular systems","cross-layer design","multihop relaying","spatial reuse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"System Design and Throughput Analysis for Multihop Relaying in Cellular Systems","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4838856/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10903043","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Design and Throughput Analysis for Multihop Relaying in Cellular Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-krzymien-2021180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072581S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4838856","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4838857,"authors":[{"name":"Juan F.

Minimum error estimation of the correlation for a hybrid spatial-TPD linear scheme previously reported cannot be obtained by simple nonlinear least-square estimators, and the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) provides an accurate solution. Channel matrix coefficients and MIMO capacities are analyzed for the diverse optimization strategies employed, which aim to identify the best prediction of MIMO performance. The novel functions are used with previously reported results and validated for Rayleigh fading scenarios with isotropic scattering using a multimode-stirred chamber (MIMO Analyzer). An accurate prediction of high correlation values is concluded to be of extreme importance for the final MIMO performance estimation. This has been found to be particularly important for estimating MIMO capacity with achieved prediction accuracies of 1.1% at SNR = 15 dB. In contrast, the accurate prediction of low correlation values has been found to have a less-important effect on the final capacity-predicting performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Estimation of Correlation and Capacity for Hybrid Spatial-Angular MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04838857.pdf","startPage":"4036","endPage":"4045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Estimation of Correlation and Capacity for Hybrid Spatial-Angular MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4838857/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903045","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Estimation of Correlation and Capacity for Hybrid Spatial-Angular MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-sanchezhernandez-2021182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09868S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4838857","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838858,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher R.

One alternative to using a single ADC is to sample the received signal with an array of lower speed ADCs that were driven by interleaved sampling clocks; however, mismatches among the ADCs will result in signal distortion. This paper makes three important contributions to overcoming this problem: 1) analytical quantification of the impact of ADC gain, offset, and timing mismatches on the performance of a time-interleaved sampling ADC array for UWB signals; 2) demonstration of the efficacy of using a pilot-based matched-filter architecture to mitigate the impact of timing mismatches in the presence of multipath; and 3) implementation of an 8-ADC time-interleaved UWB SDR testbed that operates at an effective sampling frequency of 6.4 GHz. In addition, our findings allow for the design specification of the number of pilots required to obtain a desired system performance. The simulation and measured performance results from this paper demonstrate that ADC mismatches can be controlled to within plusmn10%, yielding acceptable levels of distortion and bit-error-rate (BER) performance on the UWB SDR testbed. Both analytical and simulation results also demonstrate the efficacy of a pilot-based matched filter in mitigating the impact of timing mismatch errors, even in the presence of multipath.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838858/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903044","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Implementation of a Time-Interleaved ADC Array for a Software-Defined UWB Receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Implementation of a Time-Interleaved ADC Array for a Software-Defined UWB Receiver","sourcePdf":"tvt-anderson-2021268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149463S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4838858","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4838859,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Cui","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4838859/4838859-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shan Cui (S'07) received the B.Eng. degree (with first-class honors) in electrical and electronic engineering in 2006 from the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Her research interest is in the area of ultrawideband communications."]},"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37951983400"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4838859/4838859-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Liang Guan (M'99) received the B.Eng. degree (with first-class honors) from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 1991 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of London, London, U.K., in 1997.","From 1991 to 1994, he was a Cellular Mobile Radio System Engineer and a Wireless Sensor Design Engineer with Singapore Telecom and Singapore Technologies, respectively.

It is observed that the conventional noncoherent energy detector for OOK signals suffers from a huge performance loss compared with that of the coherent detector, which suggests space of improvement. It is also found that the OOK signaling can be treated as a special case of TR signaling with pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM). Inspired by this observation, we propose a new pseudocoherent detection scheme for OOK transmission, which can also be applied to pulse-position-modulation (PPM) transmission. We also consider the implementation issues of the proposed receiver, such as the high sampling rate requirement. We propose a new scheme named bandpass downsampling (BPDS) to overcome this difficulty. With BPDS, we are able to reduce the sampling rate to one tenth of the Nyquist rate, and yet, it can provide performance with a small degradation. A theoretical analysis is carried out to evaluate the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed receiver. The numerical results show that the performance of the proposed receiver can drastically be improved from that of the conventional energy detector (CED).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04838859.pdf","startPage":"4141","endPage":"4148","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudocoherent Detection of OOK/PPM Signals as Zero-Delay Transmitted-Reference Signals With Bandpass Downsampling for UWB Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Pseudocoherent Detection of OOK/PPM Signals as Zero-Delay Transmitted-Reference Signals With Bandpass Downsampling for UWB Communications","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4838859/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903046","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudocoherent Detection of OOK/PPM Signals as Zero-Delay Transmitted-Reference Signals With Bandpass Downsampling for UWB Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-teh-2021269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048587S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4838859","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4838860,"authors":[{"name":"Graciela Gonzalez-Farias","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Matem\u00e1ticas, Guanajuato, Mexico"],"firstName":"Graciela","lastName":"Gonzalez-Farias","id":"38304577300"},{"name":"J.

The onset of PDR is signaled by the appearance of neovascular net. Such neovascular nets might be identified using retinal vessel extraction techniques. The commonly used matched filter methods often produce false positive detections of neovascular nets due to their proneness to detect nonline edges as well as lines. In this paper, we propose a modified matched filter for retinal vessel extraction that applies a local vessel cross-section analysis using double-sided thresholding to reduce false responses to nonlinear edges. Our proposed modified matched filters demonstrated higher true positive rate and lesser false detection than existing matched-filter-based schemes in vessel extraction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838867/","accessionNumber":"10773241","pubMedId":"19389699","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Matched Filter With Double-Sided Thresholding for Screening Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Matched Filter With Double-Sided Thresholding for Screening Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy","sourcePdf":"titb-zhang-2007201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091381S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5156189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5156189","articleId":"4838867","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4838868,"authors":[{"name":"Norio Kashima","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication, Faculty of Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Norio Kashima (M'87\u2013SM'96) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Yokohama National University, Japan, in 1973 and 1975, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, in 1984.","He joined NTT in 1975, where, he was engaged in research and development of optical fiber design, optical fiber cable, fusion splicing, optical connectors, optical transmission systems, customer premise networks, and access network operation systems.

The proposed method is based on the assumption that the excitation to the vocal-tract system can be approximated by a sequence of impulses of varying strengths. The effect due to an impulse in the time-domain is spread uniformly across the frequency-domain including at zero-frequency. We propose the use of a zero-frequency resonator to extract the characteristics of excitation source from speech signals by filtering out most of the time-varying vocal-tract information. The regions of glottal activity and the strengths of excitation estimated from the speech signal are in close agreement with those observed from the simultaneously recorded electro-glotto-graph signals. The performance of the proposed glottal activity detection is evaluated under different noisy environments at varying levels of degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4838850/04838881.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2016829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2016829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4838850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of Glottal Activity From Speech Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonator filters","Information filtering","Information filters","Data mining","Production systems","Time varying systems","Speech analysis","Frequency","Time domain analysis","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","frequency-domain analysis","graph theory","signal detection","speech processing","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech signal filtering","glottal activity cycle detection","time-varying vocal-tract information","time-domain","frequency-domain","zero-frequency resonator","electro-glotto-graph signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Glottal activity detection","strength of excitation","zero-frequency resonator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Glottal Activity From Speech Signals","volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4838881/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10601198","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Glottal Activity From Speech Signals","sourcePdf":"16lsp06-am-2016829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057229S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4838850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4838850","articleId":"4838881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4838885,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond Kwan","affiliation":["University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Kwan","id":"37279093700"},{"name":"Cyril Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279072600"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281474400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4838885","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":173,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":6322},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The challenge of scheduling user transmissions on the downlink of a long term evolution (LTE) cellular communication system is addressed.

Using state-space methods, we quantify the constraints imposed on feedback controllers by closed-loop delay. We first derive a complete nonlinear state-space control model of a SOA with an equivalent circuit containing parasitics and dynamic impedance; the analytical state-space model agrees well with a validated photonic-only control model. Using a linearized version of the model we demonstrate that time delay in the feedback path can destabilize the SOA through phase accumulation. We then apply linear system theory to calculate the best-case stable delay margin for a given controller norm, and find a potentially severe inverse relationship between delay margin and controller norm. Finally, guided by the delay-controller relationship we design a hybrid feedforward-feedback controller to illustrate that good transient and steady-state regulation is obtained by carefully balancing the feedforward and feedback components. Our state-space modeling and design methods are general and are easily adapted to the design and analysis of more complex photonic circuits.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.928214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.928214","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1107","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4815931/04838887.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Feedback Delay on Closed-Loop Stability in Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Control Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Feedback Delay on Closed-Loop Stability in Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Control Circuits","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","volume":"27","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4838887/","accessionNumber":"10601167","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838887/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Feedback Delay on Closed-Loop Stability in Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Control Circuits","sourcePdf":"26jlt00-kuntze2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085132S","chronDate":"May1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4815931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4815931","articleId":"4838887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838899,"authors":[{"name":"Pritha Banerjee","affiliation":["Advanced Computing and Microelectronics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4838810/4838899/4838899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pritha Banerjee received the B.C.S. and M.C.S. degrees in computer science from the University of Pune, Pune, India, in 1996 and 1998, respectively.

The method consists of a recursive balanced bipartitioning followed by the generation of slicing topologies and finally the allocation of CLBs and RAM/MULs to modules by a greedy heuristic and minimum-cost maximum-flow method, respectively. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that our method HeteroFloorplan produces feasible floorplans within a few seconds with total half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) improvement of 18%-52% over the very few previous approaches.

Following a worst-case deterministic model, the actual channel is assumed to be inside an ellipsoid centered at a nominal channel. The objective is to maximize the worst-case received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or to minimize the worst-case Chernoff bound of the error probability, thus leading to a maximin problem. Moreover, we also consider the QoS problem, as a complement of the maximin design, which minimizes the transmit power consumption and meanwhile keeps the received SNR above a given threshold for any channel realization in the ellipsoid. It is shown that, for a general class of power constraints, both the maximin and QoS problems can be equivalently transformed into convex problems, or even further into semidefinite programs (SDPs), thus efficiently solvable by the numerical methods. The most interesting result is that the optimal transmit directions, i.e., the eigenvectors of the transmit covariance, are just the right singular vectors of the nominal channel under some mild conditions. This result leads to a channel-diagonalizing structure, as in the cases of perfect CSIT and statistical CSIT with mean or covariance feedback, and reduces the complicated matrix-valued problem to a scalar power allocation problem. Then we provide the closed-form solution to the resulting power allocation problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","volume":"57","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10764098","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838902/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Worst-Case Robust MIMO Transmission With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst-Case Robust MIMO Transmission With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","sourcePdf":"57tsp08-jwang-2021451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.33872S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5165248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"5165248","articleId":"4838902","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4838903,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, M.N.

The sampling frequency of the digital processor is considered as an integer multiple of the modulation switching frequency. An expression for the determination of the modulation design parameter is developed for smooth modulation at a fixed switching frequency. The variation of the sampling frequency, switching frequency, and modulation index has been analyzed for the determination of the switching condition under closed loop. It is shown that the switching condition determined based on the continuous-time analysis of the closed-loop modulation will ensure smooth modulation upon the digital implementation of the modulation process. However, the stability properties need to be tested prior to digital implementation as they get deteriorated at smaller sampling frequencies. The closed-loop modulation index needs to be considered maximum while determining the design parameters for smooth modulation. In particular, a detailed analysis has been carried out by varying the control gain in the sliding-mode control of a two-level VSI. The proposed analysis of the closed-loop modulation of the VSI has been verified for the operation of a distribution static compensator. The theoretical results are validated experimentally on both single- and three-phase systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2020708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04838903.pdf","startPage":"2382","endPage":"2392","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2020708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristic Analysis for Multisampled Digital Implementation of Fixed-Switching-Frequency Closed-Loop Modulation of Voltage-Source Inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Characteristic Analysis for Multisampled Digital Implementation of Fixed-Switching-Frequency Closed-Loop Modulation of Voltage-Source Inverter","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4838903/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736250","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristic Analysis for Multisampled Digital Implementation of Fixed-Switching-Frequency Closed-Loop Modulation of Voltage-Source Inverter","sourcePdf":"tie-gupta-2020708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080752S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4838903","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4838906,"authors":[{"name":"Karel Jezernik","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/4838906/4838906-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karel Jezernik (M'77\u2013SM'04) received B.Sc., M.Sc., and Dr. Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 1968, 1974, and 1976, respectively.","In 1976, he joined the University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, where, in 1985, he became a Full Professor and the Head of the Institute of Robotics and is currently in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

We also propose integrated motion-control architecture based on discrete-event control approach to be implemented in digital logic at an equally high rate. A switching controller combines the current and motion feedback paths into a single loop. A model-based observer estimates the load torque. When compared to second-order controllers implemented with traditional amplifiers, the proposed design promises increased performance, better efficiency, and improved load estimation. Simple implementation makes concepts of switching control very attractive in motion-control systems like control of dc or ac servomotors. The control algorithm designed by the proposed approach can be easily implemented on field programmable gate array platforms.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2020709","startPage":"3810","endPage":"3816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/04838906.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2020709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Precision Motion Control of Servo Drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion control","Servomechanisms","Control systems","Motor drives","Logic","Feedback loop","Torque","Servomotors","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","discrete event systems","feedback","machine control","motion control","observers","servomotors","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high precision motion control","servo drives","motor control","discrete-event control approach","digital logic","motion feedback paths","model-based observer","second-order controllers","traditional amplifiers","improved load estimation","dc servomotors","ac servomotors","field programmable gate array platforms","switching control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Converter control","discrete-event systems","field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","permanent magnet motors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"High Precision Motion Control of Servo Drives","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4838906/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10869406","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Precision Motion Control of Servo Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-jezernik-2020709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052524S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"4838906","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838918,"authors":[{"name":"Na He","affiliation":["Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/4838918/4838918-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Na He was born in Shandong, China, in 1979.

However, several issues in their analysis remain unsolved, particularly under the assumption of imperfect collision-multiplicity detection in asymmetrical system configurations (i.e., configurations where the users have different channel and queuing statistics). To partially fill this gap, this paper presents a detailed study on stability, throughput and delay properties of asymmetrical nonblind NDMA protocols under such imperfect detection assumption. Additionally, the protocol formulation includes a carrier-sense mechanism which is found to improve system performance under finite-SNR environments and which can be useful in assessing the benefits of retransmission diversity on IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). New expressions for the parameters and performance metrics of the NDMA protocol under different assumptions are here provided. These include the stability condition of a system without feedback to acknowledge correct packet reception and the derivation of the boundaries of the throughput region using a joint cross-layer optimization with respect to the probabilities of transmission and false alarm. Simulation results are used to further assess the performance of the protocol and to confirm the analytic results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","volume":"57","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10816664","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4838923/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Networks With Retransmission Diversity and Carrier-Sense Multiple Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Networks With Retransmission Diversity and Carrier-Sense Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"57tsp08-rsamano-robles-2021455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073627S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4838923","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4838924,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5165248/4838924/4838924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gan Zheng (S'05\u2013M'09) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Tianjin University, China, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, both in electronic and information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2008.","He has been working as a Research Associate at University College London since December 2007.

While fixed or variable-power relays have been previously investigated, this paper addresses the collaborative use of variable-phase variable-power amplify-and-forward (AF) relays for robust beamforming, with the aid of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the sender. In particular, the maximization of the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination terminal is studied under a bounded spherical region for the norm of the CSI error vector from the relays to the destination. Our main contribution is that we prove, under a condition on the quality of the estimated CSI, the robust-optimal collaborative-relay beamforming (CRBF) can be obtained by S-procedure and rank relaxation techniques. In addition, a distributed algorithm is developed by examining the structure of the optimal CRBF solution.

Whenever the generator has compact support, among these formulas it is possible to find one whose associated reconstruction functions have also compact support.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838929/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816678","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Oversampling in Shift-Invariant Spaces With a Rational Sampling Period","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampling in Shift-Invariant Spaces With a Rational Sampling Period","sourcePdf":"57tsp08-gperez-villalon-2021497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080197S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4838929","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":4838930,"authors":[{"name":"Youshen Xia","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Youshen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37281299200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4838930","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Computer networks","Image converters","Computational modeling","Signal processing","Image processing","Least squares approximation","Linear programming","Working environment noise","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","recurrent neural nets","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact cooperative recurrent neural network","linear signal","image models","nonGaussian noise environments","nonlinear elliptical sphere constraint","computational complexity","least absolute deviation problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact recurrent neural networks","constrained LAD estimation","elliptical sphere constraint","general linear constraints"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838930","abstract":"Recently, cooperative recurrent neural networks for solving three linearly constrained \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n estimation problems were developed and applied to linear signal and image models under non-Gaussian noise environments.

Through the use of majorization theory, we first investigate in detail the ergodic capacity of Nakagami-m fading channels, for which we derive several ergodic capacity upper and lower bounds. We then show that a simple expression for the capacity upper bound is possible for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which permits to analyze the impact of the channel fading parameter m on the ergodic capacity. The asymptotic behavior of the capacity in the large-system limit in which the number of antennas at one or both side(s) goes to infinity, is also addressed. Results demonstrate that the capacity scaling laws for Nakagami-m and Rayleigh-fading MIMO channels are identical. Finally, we employ the same technique to distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) systems undergoing composite log-normal and Nakagami fading, where we derive similar ergodic capacity upper and lower bounds. Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to verify the tightness of the proposed bounds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Bounds for MIMO Nakagami-- Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2021502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5200771/04838931.pdf","startPage":"3613","endPage":"3623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2021502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838931/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Bounds for MIMO Nakagami-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4838931/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816643","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Bounds for MIMO Nakagami-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"57tsp08-czhong-2021502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102367S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4838931","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838935,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Pitti","affiliation":["Department of Mechano-Informatics, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563672/5038478/4838935/4838935-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandre Pitti received the M.Eng. degree and DEA from Engineer School, ESME Sudria, Paris, France, and the University Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France, respectively, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2007.","Currently, he is a Researcher at the ERATO Asada Synergistic Intelligence Project, JST.

Babies develop early this feeling by perceiving the contingency between afferent (sensor) and efferent (motor) information. A comparator model is hypothesized to be associated with many brain regions to monitor and simulate the concordance between self-produced actions and their consequences. In this paper, we propose that the biological mechanism of spike timing-dependent plasticity, that synchronizes the neural dynamics almost everywhere in the central nervous system, constitutes the perfect algorithm to detect contingency in sensorimotor networks. The coherence or the dissonance in the sensorimotor information flow imparts then the agency level. In a head-neck-eyes robot, we replicate three developmental experiments illustrating how particular perceptual experiences can modulate the overall level of agency inside the system; i.e., (1) by adding a delay between proprioceptive and visual feedback information, (2) by facing a mirror, and (3) a person. We show that the system learns to discriminate animated objects (self-image and other persons) from other type of stimuli. This suggests a basic stage representing the self in relation to others from low-level sensorimotor processes. We discuss then the relevance of our findings with neurobiological evidences and development psychological observations for developmental robots.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5038478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAMD.2009.2021506","doi":"10.1109/TAMD.2009.2021506","startPage":"86","endPage":"97","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563672/5038478/04838935.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838935/","displayDocTitle":"Contingency Perception and Agency Measure in Visuo-Motor Spiking Neural Networks","volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"10712647","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838935/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contingency Perception and Agency Measure in Visuo-Motor Spiking Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"01tamd01-apitti-2021506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100387S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"5038478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5038478","articleId":"4838935","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4838936,"authors":[{"name":"Biagio Masella","affiliation":["Advanced Photonic Systems Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5153581/4838936/4838936-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Biagio Masella was born in Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada.

A theoretical model describing the characteristics of the SOA-based intensity modulators is developed, based on which optimum SOA operating conditions are identified. It is shown that the optimized SOA-based intensity modulators support a 30 Gb/s AMOOFDM signal transmission over a 80 km SMF, which doubles the transmission performance offered by directly modulated DFB lasers. The aforementioned performance enhancement is mainly due to a considerable reduction in the frequency chirp effect, resulting from the strong SOA gain saturation-induced decrease in SOA effective carrier lifetime. Relatively low extinction ratio and clipping of the SOA modulated signals are identified to be the key factors limiting the maximum achievable AMOOFDM transmission performance. In addition, results also indicate that both the optimum SOA operating conditions and the AMOOFDM transmission performance are insusceptible to variations in SOA parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5170198/04838938.pdf","startPage":"3678","endPage":"3688","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2021164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2021164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4838938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-Enabled Intensity Modulation of Adaptively Modulated Optical OFDM Signals in SMF-Based IMDD Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical modulation","Adaptive optics","Stimulated emission","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Intensity modulation","OFDM modulation","Optical saturation","Chirp modulation","Frequency modulation","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","optical modulation","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optical amplifier","intensity modulation","adaptive modulated optical OFDM signals","SMF-based IMDD systems","numerical investigations","chromatic dispersion compensation","DFB lasers","single mode fiber transmission systems","intensity-modulation and direct-detection systems","distributed feedback lasers","bit rate 30 Gbit/s","distance 80 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","optical modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-Enabled Intensity Modulation of Adaptively Modulated Optical OFDM Signals in SMF-Based IMDD Systems","volume":"27","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/4838938/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10800545","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-Enabled Intensity Modulation of Adaptively Modulated Optical OFDM Signals in SMF-Based IMDD Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-tang-2021164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095676S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5170198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5170198","articleId":"4838938","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4838951,"authors":[{"name":"Laleh Najafizadeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Laleh","lastName":"Najafizadeh","id":"37270037900"},{"name":"Joseph S.

Moreover, we analyze the performance degradation of the equal gain precoder due to scalar quantization theoretically. The result shows that 2-3 bits per transmit antenna (excluding the first antenna) can achieve 0.5-0.25-dB performance gap compared with the same scheme without quantization.

Inspired by the complementary and dominance mechanisms in nature, a primal-dual GA (PDGA) has been proposed for dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). In this paper, an important operator in PDGA, i.e., the primal-dual mapping (PDM) scheme, is further investigated to improve the robustness and adaptability of PDGA in dynamic environments. In the improved scheme, two different probability-based PDM operators, where the mapping probability of each allele in the chromosome string is calculated through the statistical information of the distribution of alleles in the corresponding gene locus over the population, are effectively combined according to an adaptive Lamarckian learning mechanism. In addition, an adaptive dominant replacement scheme, which can probabilistically accept inferior chromosomes, is also introduced into the proposed algorithm to enhance the diversity level of the population. Experimental results on a series of dynamic problems generated from several stationary benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm is a good optimizer for DOPs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

performance can therefore be degraded under imperfect channel estimation. In this letter, we propose a novel soft-output MMSE MIMO detector under maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation for a MIMO system with spatially correlated receiver and transmitter antennas. Our proposed detector takes both channel estimation errors and spatial correlation of antennas into account when constructing MMSE filter and computing log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of each coded bit. Simulation results show the proposed novel detector outperforms existing soft-output MMSE MIMO detector with considerable improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4838967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4838967/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10774892","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Output MMSE MIMO Detector Under ML Channel Estimation and Channel Correlation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Output MMSE MIMO Detector Under ML Channel Estimation and Channel Correlation","sourcePdf":"16lsp07-jwang-2021368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041562S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4967994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4967994","articleId":"4838967","onlineDate":"21 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4839008,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Song Meng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4839008/4839008-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Song Meng (S'09) received the B.Eng.

By reusing the decoder for encoding, both tasks can be performed using the same circuit, thus reducing area and verification requirements. Motivated by this, iterative encoding techniques based upon the graphical representation of the code are proposed. Code design constraints which ensure encoder convergence are presented, and then used to design iteratively encodable codes, while also preventing 4-cycle creation. We show how the Jacobi method for iterative matrix inversion can be applied to finite field matrices, viewed as message passing, and employed as the core of an iterative encoder. We present an algebraic construction of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</i>\n-cycle free iteratively encodable codes using circulant matrices. Analysis of these codes identifies a weakness in their structure, due to a repetitive pattern in the factor graph. The graph supports pseudo-codewords of low pseudo-weight. In order to remove the repetitive pattern in the graph, we propose a recursive technique for generating iteratively encodable codes. The new codes offer flexibility in the choice of code length and rate, and performance that compares well to randomly generated, quasi-cyclic and extended Euclidean-geometry codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4839012/04839030.pdf","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2016025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2016025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversible Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Jacobian matrices","Iterative decoding","Circuits","Encoding","Iterative methods","Sum product algorithm","Convergence","Galois fields","Message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","geometric codes","iterative decoding","iterative methods","matrix algebra","message passing","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reversible low-density parity-check codes","sum-product algorithm","factor graph","decoder","iterative encoding techniques","code design constraints","Jacobi method","iterative matrix inversion","finite field matrices","message passing","pseudo-codewords","low pseudo-weight code","extended Euclidean-geometry codes","quasi-cyclic codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bipartite graph","block codes","codes on graphs","cycles in a graph","encoding","iterative decoding","linear codes","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","sparse matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reversible Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4839030/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601153","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversible Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","sourcePdf":"55tit05-dhaley-2016025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124052S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4839012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4839012","articleId":"4839030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4839031,"authors":[{"name":"Darryl Dexu Lin","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Darryl Dexu Lin received the B.A.Sc. degree (with Honors) in engineering science from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2001.

The proposed framework may be used in multiple-access interference (MAI), intersymbol interference (ISI), and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Without loss of generality, we will focus our attention on turbo multiuser detection, to facilitate a more concrete discussion.

In addition to its systematic appeal, there are several other advantages to this viewpoint. First of all, it provides unified and rigorous justifications for numerous detectors that were proposed on radically different grounds, and facilitates convenient joint detection and decoding (utilizing the turbo principle) when error-control codes are incorporated. Second, efficient joint parameter estimation and data detection is possible via the variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, such that the detrimental effect of inaccurate channel knowledge at the receiver may be dealt with systematically. We are also able to extend BPSK-based SISO detection schemes to arbitrary square QAM constellations in a rigorous manner using a variational argument.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intersymbol interference","Multiple access interference","MIMO","Multiuser detection","Concrete","Energy management","Detectors","Decoding","Parameter estimation","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","expectation-maximisation algorithm","intersymbol interference","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variational inference framework","soft-in soft-out detection","multiple-access channels","intersymbol interference","multiple-input multiple-output channels","a posteriori probability","variational free energy","variational expectation maximization algorithm","BPSK","QAM","error-control codes","joint detection","joint decoding","turbo multiuser detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free energy","interference cancellation","message passing","soft-in soft-out (SISO) detection","turbo multiuser detection","variational inference"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2016054","startPage":"2345","endPage":"2364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4839012/04839031.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2016054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Variational Inference Framework for Soft-In Soft-Out Detection in Multiple-Access Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Variational Inference Framework for Soft-In Soft-Out Detection in Multiple-Access Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10601154","publicationDate":"May 2009","volume":"55","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839031/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Variational Inference Framework for Soft-In Soft-Out Detection in Multiple-Access Channels","sourcePdf":"55tit05-dlin-2016054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097887S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4839012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4839012","articleId":"4839031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4839032,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Angelosante","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Angelosante","id":"37299795200"},{"name":"Ezio Biglieri","affiliation":["Departament TIC, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ezio","lastName":"Biglieri","id":"37269642000"},{"name":"Marco Lops","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lops","id":"37268086700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4839032","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"The problem of jointly estimating the number, the identities, and the data of active users in a time-varying multiuser environment was examined in a companion paper (IEEE Trans. Information Theory, vol. 53, no. 9, September 2007), at whose core was the use of the theory of finite random sets on countable spaces. Here we extend that theory to encompass the more general problem of estimating unknown continuous parameters of the active-user signals. This problem is solved here by applying the theory of random finite sets constructed on hybrid spaces. We do so deriving Bayesian recursions that describe the evolution with time of a posteriori densities of the unknown parameters and data. Unlike in the above cited paper, wherein one could evaluate the exact multiuser set posterior density, here the continuous-parameter Bayesian recursions do not admit closed-form expressions. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop numerical approximations for the receivers that are based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods (ldquoparticle filteringrdquo). Simulation results, referring to a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system, are presented to illustrate the theory.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4839012/04839032.pdf","startPage":"2365","endPage":"2374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2016008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2016008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Detection in a Dynamic Environment\u2014 Part II: Joint User Identification and Parameter Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Parameter estimation","Bayesian methods","Sliding mode control","Information theory","Closed-form solution","Monte Carlo methods","Filtering theory","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","multiuser detection","particle filtering (numerical methods)","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","dynamic environment","user identification","parameter estimation","time-varying multiuser environment","random finite sets","hybrid spaces","Bayesian recursions","sequential Monte Carlo methods","particle filtering","code-division multiple-access system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian recursions","multiuser detection","particle filtering","random-set theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Detection in a Dynamic Environment\u2014 Part II: Joint User Identification and Parameter Estimation","volume":"55","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10587614","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Detection in a Dynamic Environment\u2014 Part II: Joint User Identification and Parameter Estimation","sourcePdf":"55tit05-ebiglieri-2016008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061301S","chronDate":"May  2009","isNumber":"4839012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4839032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4839035,"authors":[{"name":"Gr\u00c9gory Berhuy","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Gr\u00e9gory Berhuy was born in France in 1973.

The results are extended to the bit flipping algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2015990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4839012/04839050.pdf","startPage":"2055","endPage":"2061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2015990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Correction Capability of Column-Weight-Three LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correction Capability of Column-Weight-Three LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839050/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10587629","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839050/","volume":"55","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correction Capability of Column-Weight-Three LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"55tit05-schilappagari-2015990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076812S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4839012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4839012","articleId":"4839050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4839051,"authors":[{"name":"Viveck R.

By design, WSCs are inherently noise tolerant. Therefore, these codes can be seen as special instances of robust compressed sensing schemes. The main results of the paper are lower and upper bounds on the largest achievable code rates of several classes of WSCs. These bounds suggest that, with the codeword and weighting vector constraints at hand, one can improve the code rates achievable by standard compressive sensing techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4839012/04839057.pdf","startPage":"2215","endPage":"2229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2016024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2016024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Superimposed Codes and Constrained Integer Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Signal processing","Vectors","Upper bound","Noise robustness","Code standards","Databases","Information retrieval","Testing","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted superimposed codes","constrained integer compressed sensing","Euclidean superimposed codes","integer-valued linear combinations","real-valued codewords","robust compressed sensing schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code exponent","compressive sensing","random coding bound","sphere-packing bound","superimposed codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Superimposed Codes and Constrained Integer Compressed Sensing","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4839057/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601161","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Superimposed Codes and Constrained Integer Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"55tit05-wdai-2016024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093133S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4839012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4839012","articleId":"4839057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4839058,"authors":[{"name":"Yoichiro Watanabe","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Information Engineering and Science, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichiro","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37277580300"},{"name":"Koichi Kamoi","affiliation":["Knowledge, Inc., Wako, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Kamoi","id":"37283192400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4839058","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","Mutual information","Probability distribution","Aggregates","Sufficient conditions","Equations","Memoryless systems","Information science","Problem-solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","multi-access systems","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","multiple access channel","N-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel","Kuhn-Tucker conditions","input probability distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boundary equation","channel capacity","connectedness","elementary multiple-access channel","Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions","local maximum"]}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> The necessary and sufficient condition of the channel capacity is rigorously formulated for the <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$N$</tex> </formula>-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC).

Therefore, it is beneficial to system planners if the congestion or locational marginal pricing (LMP) versus load is readily available. This can certainly be obtained by repetitively running an optimization model at different load levels. However, this approach is too brute-force to be practical. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to identify the new binding constraint and the new marginal unit set when the system load increases from the present load level. It addresses the challenge of step changes in generation dispatch when a generation or transmission limit becomes binding. The algorithm also gives the new sensitivity of the new marginal units. Therefore, the generation dispatch, congested lines, and LMP at a new critical load level (CLL) can be easily calculated. Test results are presented in matrix formulation to clearly demonstrate and verify the proposed algorithm. Since the proposed approach is based on linearized model, it should be particularly suitable for short-term planning or operation, although application to long-term planning is also possible.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Pricing","Energy management","Power system management","Power generation","Load flow","Predictive models","Load modeling","Testing","Power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power generation dispatch","power markets","power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["market-based planning","price prediction","generation dispatching","locational marginal pricing","system planners","optimization model","critical load level","short-term planning","long-term planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Congestion management","critical load level (CLL)","energy markets","generation sensitivity","locational marginal pricing (LMP)","optimal power flow (OPF)","power markets"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4839059/04839064.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion and Price Prediction Under Load Variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Congestion and Price Prediction Under Load Variation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839064/","volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839064/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10587711","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion and Price Prediction Under Load Variation","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs02-fli-2016599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080996S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4839059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4839059","articleId":"4839064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4839066,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil H.

In this paper, a unified approach is proposed in order to determine the optimal number and locations of PMUs to make the system measurement model observable and thereby can be used for power system state estimation. The PMU placement problem is formulated as a binary integer linear programming (BILP), in which the binary decision variables (0, 1) determine whether to install a PMU at each bus, while preserving the system observability and lowest system metering economy. The proposed approach integrates the impacts of both existing conventional power injection/flow measurements (if any) and the possibility of single or multiple PMU loss into the decision strategy of the optimal PMU allocation. Unlike other available techniques, the network topology remains unaltered for the inclusion of conventional measurements, and therefore the network connectivity matrix is built only once based on the original network topology. The mathematical formulation of the problem maintains the original bus ordering of the system under study, and therefore the solution directly points at the optimal PMU locations. Simulations using Matlab are conducted on a simple testing seven-bus system, as well as on different IEEE systems (14-bus, 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus) to prove the validity of the proposed method. The results obtained in this paper are compared with those published before in literature.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4839059/04839066.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Approach for the Optimal PMU Location for Power System State Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839066/","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach for the Optimal PMU Location for Power System State Estimation","volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10587709","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839066/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach for the Optimal PMU Location for Power System State Estimation","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs03-nabbasy-2016596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042194S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4839059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"4839059","articleId":"4839066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4839073,"authors":[{"name":"Rob Maaskant","affiliation":["Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy, Dwingeloo, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Maaskant","id":"37320002800"},{"name":"Bill Yang","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Yang","id":"37306994000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-92-9092-937-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"4839073","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave antennas","Radio astronomy","Computational modeling","Receivers","Working environment noise","Receiving antennas","Power system modeling","Background noise","Noise level","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna system model, antenna noise, microwave receiver, signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combined electromagnetic and microwave antenna system simulator for radio astronomy","doi":"10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4839073","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563629/4584476/04839073.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4584476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4839073","abstract":"A generic numerical tool has been developed to compute/optimize the sensitivity of array antenna receiver systems.

The model driven performance engineering (MDPE) process is one concrete illustration of such a situation. This process applies MDE within the context of performance engineering in order to support domain experts, who generally lack the necessary performance expertise. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of megamodelling to manage the numerous artifacts involved in MDPE. Megamodelling enables the explicit modelling of the metadata on MDE artifacts, including possible relationships between those artifacts. Appropriate tool support enables different stakeholders to exploit this additional information. Applying the megamodelling to MDPE pointed out the need for an extension of the existing approach. Thus, the result of the paper is twofold: first, an extension of megamodelling is proposed, second the benefits of the approach are shown on the MDPE use case. We claim that the extension is not solely useful for the latter case, but has a more generic applicability.","doi":"10.1109/ECBS.2009.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECBS.2009.33","startPage":"244","endPage":"253","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th Annual IEEE International Conference and Workshop on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4839214/4839215/04839251.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 16th Annual IEEE International Conference and Workshop on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Megamodelling to Model Driven Performance Engineering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Applying Megamodelling to Model Driven Performance Engineering","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839251/","accessionNumber":"10588828","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839251/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Megamodelling to Model Driven Performance Engineering","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3602a244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111577S","chronDate":"14-16 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4839214","isNumber":"4839215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4839214","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4839215","articleId":"4839251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4839339,"authors":[{"name":"T.

After those experiences, Italy through the Italian space agency (ASI) was one of the first European countries that have made an effort toward the exploitation of Q/V band in telecommunications. In 2004 ASI funded a feasibility study (phase A), called TRANSPONDERS, Italian acronym for ldquoresearch, analysis and study of Q/V payloads for telecommunicationsrdquo, aimed at studying and designing a payload to be used to fully characterize the channel at Q/V bands and to test novel adaptive interference/fading mitigation techniques such as ACM (adaptive coding and modulation). Finally, the feasibility and performance of preliminary broadband services in such frequencies can be verified through this study. A new phase has recently started (April 2008), called TRANSPONDERS-2 and leaded by Space Engineering S.p.A., to continue the achievements gained during the first phase. In this scenario, it is mandatory to identify pre-operative experimental missions aiming at fully verifying the feasibility of future Q/V bands satellite telecommunication applications. The experimental goals are mainly to test the effectiveness of propagation impairment mitigation techniques (PIMTs) in such frequency bands and the minimization of implementation risks for operative system characterized by a series of technological challenges.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839341","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839341.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRANSPONDERS: Research and analysis for the development of telecommunication payloads in Q/v bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839341/","displayDocTitle":"TRANSPONDERS: Research and analysis for the development of telecommunication payloads in Q/v bands","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625233","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839341/","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TRANSPONDERS: Research and analysis for the development of telecommunication payloads in Q/v bands","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z02_0704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114322S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4839363,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The purpose was to understand these phenomena and mitigation approaches applicable to reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) used for commercial space. The viability and limitations of selecting frequency bands amenable to continuous communication in presence of plasma sheaths were assessed and mitigation recommendations provided. The ability to predict the ionized flow field for classes of vehicles most likely to emerge as hypersonic space transportation systems, with sufficient accuracy to identify the altitudes of blackout onset and recovery within reasonable bounds, has been demonstrated for altitudes greater than approximately 100 kft. This high-altitude regime is the most likely for future space transportation due to low g forces and low heat loads. For the lower, suborbital altitudes, many commercial RLVs will not be subjected to RF blackout because their relatively low velocities will not create conditions that generate plasma. Determination of the interaction of RF with a known ionized layer, including reflection, attenuation, refraction, high-power breakdown limits, and also effects of the plasma on the antenna characteristics, have been demonstrated successfully. Analytic codes are available to evaluate these phenomena. Approaches for mitigating the interruption of communications due to interactions of plasma electrons with RF signals are reviewed. The most promising are: aerodynamic shaping, injection of quenchants, use of magnetic windows, and use of high frequencies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839389.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing RF blackout during re-entry of the reusable launch vehicle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Plasma applications","Plasma properties","Space vehicles","Transportation","Space heating","Extraterrestrial phenomena","Plasma sheaths","Plasma transport processes","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engineering","space vehicle electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reusable launch vehicle reentry","radio frequency blackout","plasma generation","condition inhibiting communications","commercial space","frequency bands","continuous communication","plasma sheaths","ionized flow field","hypersonic space transportation system","blackout onset","ionized layer","antenna characteristics","analytic codes","communication interruption","plasma electron interaction","RF signals","aerodynamic shaping","quenchants","magnetic windows"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reducing RF blackout during re-entry of the reusable launch vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839389/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625281","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing RF blackout during re-entry of the reusable launch vehicle","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_0402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049554S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4839396,"authors":[{"name":"Richard S.

The resulting signal has a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which is undesirable from a high power amplifier (HPA) viewpoint. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce PAPR and ease the HPA requirements. Among these, constant-envelope CDMA (CE-CDMA) is an alternative that eliminates envelope variation, achieving PAPR = 0 dB. It can use a saturating (Class C) amplifier that runs at lower peak power and may be more robust and inexpensive than the Class A HPA needed for linear superposition. The latter requires significant linear dynamic range and must operate at several dB output power backoff. Constant-envelope multiplex techniques are nonlinear and thus exhibit both a multiplexing efficiency loss-part of the price one pays for a substantial reduction in peak power-and multiple access interference (MAI) among the user signals. To date there has been no systematic, quantitative exploration of multiplexing efficiency and MAI in CE-CDMA. The principal results reported in this paper are the derivation of formulas for multiplexing loss and MAI in CE-CDMA and their use to discover, for the case of homogeneous users, multiplexing methods optimum with respect to minimizing the combined losses. A comparison of MAI for linearly multiplexed and CE-CDMA concludes the paper.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839396","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839396.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","startPage":"1","endPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple access interference properties of constant-envelope CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple access interference properties of constant-envelope CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839396/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625288","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4839396/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple access interference properties of constant-envelope CDMA","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_0704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102421S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4839402,"authors":[{"name":"David Taggart","affiliation":["Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4813823/4839294/4839402/4839402-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dr. David Taggart received his B.S., MS., and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles with an emphasis on electrical engineering.

The advantage of NPR testing and/or simulation includes the ability to use a noise source and filters to obtain the band of noise with the appropriate notch for test purposes, which is typically more easily accomplished than performing BER testing and/or simulation for the specific modulated carriers that are anticipated to go through the HPA. Additionally, the types of signals anticipated to go through the HPA may be quite variable, and not all possibilities can be practically tested and/or simulated using conventional methods. NPR testing helps preclude the need for testing every possible signal combination. In this paper the authors discuss a simulation and modeling technique for determining NPR for a nonlinear amplifier with arbitrary AM/AM and AM/PM transfer curves. While NPR tests are typically done at radio frequency (RF), the model chosen is a baseband model. Specific examples of the transfer curves are chosen to demonstrate the utility and versatility of the simulation and modeling technique. Importantly, the approach described in this paper has been validated by detailed RF lab measurements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839402","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839402.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear amplifier noise product ratio modeling and simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear amplifier noise product ratio modeling and simulation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4839402/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625294","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839402/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear amplifier noise product ratio modeling and simulation","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_0804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039084S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4839406,"authors":[{"name":"Raghavendra S.

However, the OFDM waveform still suffers from a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). Larger PAR leads to higher transmit power inefficiency. In this paper, we compare two constellation modification techniques, constellation distortion (CD) and active constellation extension (ACE), to reduce the PAR of the OFDM waveform. Both techniques are similar, in the sense that the constellation symbols are modified to reduce PAR. In CD, the tradeoff is between PAR reduction and added distortion, which results in a larger bit error rate (BER). In ACE, the tradeoff is between added power and PAR reduction. A metric called normalized total power (NTP) is introduced to facilitate a comparison between these two different techniques. Using this metric, we compare the performance of the two techniques using an 802.11a OFDM waveform. We present comparisons, via simulation, in both coded and uncoded cases. The simulation results show that, for an uncoded OFDM system, ACE performs better than CD for all constellations except QPSK. However, CD is preferred over ACE when coding is present. NTP improvements using CD can be up to 4.1dB in the case of coded QPSK and up to 0.8 dB using ACE for uncoded QPSK.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active constellation modification techniques for OFDM PAR reduction","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839406","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839406.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Active constellation modification techniques for OFDM PAR reduction","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839406/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625298","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active constellation modification techniques for OFDM PAR reduction","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_0902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059082S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4839407,"authors":[{"name":"Rajendra Kumar","affiliation":["Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37272667200"},{"name":"David A.

Previous analyses of such distortion effects are mainly concerned with the total distortion power present at the amplifier output and in some cases present results on the amplifier output power spectral density. However, the power spectral density of the total signal in the fundamental zone at the amplifier output does not lend itself to the BER analysis. In the case where the total distortion power is known, one may assume that the distortion is independent of the signal of interest and has a Gaussian probability density function and thereby add the distortion power to the receiver noise power in order to obtain the BER. While such a simplified approach may be valid in some cases, such assumptions do not apply to the case of a single band limited digital signal at the amplifier input, which is the case of interest here. In fact this paper shows that in this case the distortion is neither Gaussian nor independent of the signal. Thus the BER analysis in such a case becomes relatively difficult. This paper presents a semi-analytical approach to the evaluation of the BER in the presence of both the amplifier distortion and the receiver noise. It is shown in the paper that the conditional probability density function of the amplifier distortion can be modeled by a sum of Gaussian distributions whereby the BER in the presence of both the amplifier distortion and receiver noise can be expressed in terms of a weighted sum of Q-functions.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839407","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839407.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detailed analysis of the impact of the distortion due to nonlinear amplifiers on BER performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detailed analysis of the impact of the distortion due to nonlinear amplifiers on BER performance","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839407/","accessionNumber":"10625299","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839407/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detailed analysis of the impact of the distortion due to nonlinear amplifiers on BER performance","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_0903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052396S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4839408,"authors":[{"name":"Raghavendra S.

Under suitable conditions, orthogonally polarized antennas can provide uncorrelated signals without requiring any or much spatial separation. The channel capacity gains that result from MIMO (in general) depend heavily on the scattering environment. In this paper, we are interested in studying the capacity gains (or losses) that result from using co-located multi-polarized antennas in relation to that which would result from using an antenna array with spatially separated antennas. These gains are likely a function of the scattering environment and propagation conditions. To facilitate this study, we utilize a physical model for MIMO wireless channels, which takes into account scatterer geometry, gain and polarization pattern of the antenna and polarization coupling mechanism, among other details. The channel capacity performance of three different 3 times 3 MIMO configurations are reported for various different channel scenarios. The results indicate that a multi-polarized tripole antenna configuration provides robust MIMO performance for all the channel scenarios considered. A multimode patch antenna configuration also displays robust performance and also has the added advantage of being co-planar.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating MIMO systems with multi-polarized antennas.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839408","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839408.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating MIMO systems with multi-polarized antennas.","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839408/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625300","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating MIMO systems with multi-polarized antennas.","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_0904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056641S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4839421,"authors":[{"name":"Gennady Y.

Since this compensation is performed in the digital domain, it is as accurate as the mismatch estimation. If the input signal used for the channel mismatch estimation is a stationary stochastic process, the accuracy of the estimation is proportional to the estimation time for a given type of the input signal. The requirements for the accuracy of the mismatch estimation are determined by the resolution of the analog-to-digital converter (A/D) used in the equipment. In the paper, the time necessary for the channel mismatch estimation is determined as a function of the number n of A/D bits for several types of the input signals. It has been shown that the required estimation time is proportional to (2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n - 1)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, for all possible probability distributions of the input signal. Thus, this time grows very fast when the number of A/D bits increases. As a result, blind channel mismatch compensation becomes problematic when the number of A/D bits exceeds 12. The required estimation time also depends on the probability distribution of the receiver input signal. Among signals used in practice, the shortest estimation time corresponds to the signals that can be approximated by the sinewave with random phase, and the longest estimation time corresponds to the signals with Gaussian distribution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Circuits","Signal processing","Probability distribution","Phase estimation","Signal sampling","Stochastic processes","Signal resolution","Analog-digital conversion","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","channel estimation","Gaussian distribution","signal processing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel sampling circuits","weighted integration","adaptive compensation","blind estimation","mismatch estimation","stationary stochastic process","analog-to-digital converter","input signal probability distributions","blind channel mismatch compensation","Gaussian distribution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839421","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839421.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel mismatch compensation in multichannel sampling circuits with weighted integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel mismatch compensation in multichannel sampling circuits with weighted integration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839421/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839421/","accessionNumber":"10625313","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel mismatch compensation in multichannel sampling circuits with weighted integration","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_1104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074052S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4839422,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Palmieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Dell'Informazione, Seconda Universit\u00e1 di Napoli, Aversa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4813823/4839294/4839422/4839422-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Palmieri received his Laurea in Ingegneria Elettronica cum laude from Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy, in 1980.

The inescapable frequency, symbol and phase synchronization problem in our model of receiver is approached and solved blindly with an information-theoretic criterion: joint entropy maximization is utilized for frequency and symbol synchronization while mutual information minimization is utilized for phase recovery. The innovative contribution of this paper consists in matching band-pass sampling and blind synchronization with a design of a synchronized reconfigurable receiver for QAM signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM Receiver with Band-Pass Sampling and blind synchronization","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839422","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839422.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"QAM Receiver with Band-Pass Sampling and blind synchronization","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839422/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625314","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QAM Receiver with Band-Pass Sampling and blind synchronization","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_1105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077194S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4839423,"authors":[{"name":"Yefim S.

Implementation of novel sampling with internal antialiasing filtering radically improves these parameters. This sampling accumulates (with a certain weight) signal energy over several sampling intervals for each sample, whereas conventional sampling utilizes only a small fraction of the signal energy. The accumulation of the signal energy reduces the required AMP gain and nonlinear distortions, filters out jitter, and provides flexible internal antialiasing filtering directly at the input of the analog-to-digital converter (A/D). Therefore, the novel sampling enables digitization close to the antenna, radical increase in the dynamic range and attainable bandwidth of the SDRs, as well as major improvement of their adaptivity, reconfigurability, and scale of integration. Methods of the novel sampling realization and ways of its implementation in SDRs are considered in this paper. Comparative analysis of novel sampling circuits (SCs) and conventional track-and-hold amplifiers (THAs) is performed. Theoretical restrictions that should be imposed on weight functions of the SCs are described, and recommendations for their selection are suggested. Challenges of the novel sampling realization are identified and methods of overcoming these challenges are proposed. Ways of the novel sampling implementation in SDRs intended for different applications are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4839423/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625315","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Some aspects of the design of software defined receivers based on sampling with internal filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some aspects of the design of software defined receivers based on sampling with internal filtering","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_1106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116725S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4839430,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

The proposed approach effectively uses Genetic Algorithms (GA), together with modified webs, to quickly find conflict-resolving maneuvers.

It is also efficient enough to resolve conflicts involving as many as 26 aircraft, which would be helpful in designing acrobatic maneuvers or in congested airspaces where emergency plans are needed.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839430","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839430.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conflict resolution maneuvers based on genetic algorithm modified webs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839430/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Conflict resolution maneuvers based on genetic algorithm modified webs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839430/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10625322","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conflict resolution maneuvers based on genetic algorithm modified webs","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z04_1206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084096S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4839438,"authors":[{"name":"Nikos Karafolas","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Karafolas","id":"37317793700"},{"name":"Josep Maria Perdigues Armengol","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Josep Maria Perdigues","lastName":"Armengol","id":"37317789800"},{"name":"Iain Mckenzie","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Iain","lastName":"Mckenzie","id":"37296477000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2621-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2622-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1095-323X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-323X"}],"articleNumber":"4839438","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":743},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839438","abstract":"Photonic technologies in the form of fiber optics, integrated optics and micro-photonics offer some compelling advantages when considered for use in spacecraft.

In an attempt to achieve necessary accuracy of the degree of linear polarization of better than 0.5%, the light in the optical system is subjected to a complex modulation designed to make the overall system robust against many instrumental artifacts that have plagued such measurements in the past. This scheme involves two photoelastic modulators that are beating in a carefully selected pattern against each other [1]. In order to properly sample this modulation pattern, each of the proposed nine cameras in the system needs to read out its imager array about 1000 times per second, resulting in two orders of magnitude more data than can typically be downlinked from the satellite. The onboard processing required to compress this data involves least-squares fits of Bessel functions to data from every pixel, effectively in real-time, thus requiring an on-board computing system with advanced data processing capabilities in excess of those commonly available for space flight. In order to meet the MSPI onboard processing requirements, we evaluated a Xilinx Virtex-4FX60 field programmable gate array (FPGA). In addition to configurable hardware capability, this FPGA includes PowerPC405 microprocessors, which together enable us to pursue a combination hardware/software processing system. This approach allows us to efficiently partition the processing system, using software for algorithmic ally complex tasks and hardware for more computationally intensive ones. In order to increase performance and/or meet data flow requirements we have developed a system that consists of hardware-based data-capture and least-squares Bessel function fitting and software-based transcendental function computation. We compare the capabilities of this system, and the V4FX60 accordingly, with the requirements of the MSPI camera system.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839460","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839460.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of the Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA for on-board processing in an advanced imaging system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839460/","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of the Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA for on-board processing in an advanced imaging system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625352","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839460/","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of the Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA for on-board processing in an advanced imaging system","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z06_0102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061237S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4839464,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The high accuracy, precision and stability of GRO soundings make them ideal climate benchmark observations, suitable for monitoring long-term trends in the atmosphere. For weather applications, RO observations improve the accuracy of weather forecasts by providing temperature and moisture profiles of sub-km vertical resolution, over land and ocean and in the presence of clouds. Here we describe a cost effective approach to produce a flight-capable GRO instrument, the Tri-GNSS (GPS + Galileo+GLONASS) or TriG, receiver. The objective is to join digital beam forming technology from NASA's Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) to the GNSS technology developed over the previous five years for upcoming NOAA and NASA GRO missions. The TriG receiver will employ the latest algorithms for GRO and precise orbit determination (POD) within a space hardened electronics package. This paper will describe testing of the digital beam forming method to be employed by TriG with the on-board processing of GRO limb-sounding profiles.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839464","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839464.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839464","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The TriG digital beam steered sounder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"The TriG digital beam steered sounder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839464/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839464/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625356","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The TriG digital beam steered sounder","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z06_0204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054295S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4839469,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhua Li","affiliation":["DCM Research Resources LLC, Germantown, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Winston (Wenhua) Li received the B.

Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages. In this paper, cognitive monostatic/bistatic/multistatic MIMO sonar approaches are proposed. MIMO sonar transmits different orthogonal acoustic waveforms from multiple projectors with different spatial distributions. Through space-time-waveform diversity, MIMO sonar is able to apply coherent processing techniques over the received signals, and acquires more diversity gains. The cognition concept proposed in the literature for radar and wireless communication is applied to MIMO sonar to improve its robustness and adaptability. The advantages of proposed cognitive MIMO sonar will be demonstrated by Monte Carlo computer simulations and compared to the SISO techniques.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839469","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839469.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive MIMO sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839469/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive MIMO sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625361","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839469/","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive MIMO sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z06_0501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063867S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4839472,"authors":[{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4813823/4839294/4839472/4839472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yahong Rosa Zheng received the B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 1987, and the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1989, both in electrical engineering.

More specifically, the detection threshold is derived in terms of the statistics of the environment, namely the noise variance, and the probability of false alarm P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FA</sub>\n. This paper presents a new decision statistic for a wideband spectrum sensing FFT-based constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector that has a detection threshold that is independent of the noise variance and windowing sequence. This detector enables multiple frequency bands to be monitored simultaneously and allows for the flexibility to ignore certain FFT bins such as those adversely affected by front-end filtering. For an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the exact probability distribution of the decision statistic is derived as well as the threshold. Implementation of this detector requires neither a calibration period nor real-time numerical threshold estimation algorithms to guarantee a constant false alarm rate. Furthermore, theoretical predictions of P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FA</sub>\n were found to be in agreement with laboratory measurements performed with a digital hardware realization of the proposed detector using an field programmable gate array.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839477","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839477.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839477","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new low-cost CFAR detector for spectrum sensing with cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new low-cost CFAR detector for spectrum sensing with cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839477/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839477/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625369","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new low-cost CFAR detector for spectrum sensing with cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z06_0703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117518S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4839478,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Willett","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Connecticut, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4813823/4839294/4839478/4839478-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Willett received his BASc (En-gineering Science) from the University of Toronto in 1982, and his PhD degree from Princeton University in 1986.

The proposed unmixing method assumes that the pure material spectra denoted as endmembers belong to a library that is a priori available. However, the number and the nature of endmembers appearing in the pixel are not known a priori, resulting in a model selection problem. This paper proposes to handle this model selection problem within a fully Bayesian framework. First, appropriate distributions are elected as prior distributions for the unknown parameters. Particularly, a distribution defined on a simplex is chosen as prior for an appropriate partial abundance vector to ensure the positivity and the sum-to-one constraints of the mixing coefficients. Due to the complexity of the posterior distribution, a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to estimate the number and the nature of the macroscopic materials, as well as their respective proportions in the pixel. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated by simulations on synthetic hyperspectral data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839492/","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625384","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Library-based linear unmixing for hyperspectral imagery via reversible jump MCMC sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Library-based linear unmixing for hyperspectral imagery via reversible jump MCMC sampling","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z06_1004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069261S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4839503,"authors":[{"name":"Marcio Juliato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Marcio","lastName":"Juliato","id":"37398988700"},{"name":"Catherine Gebotys","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Gebotys","id":"37265040400"},{"name":"Reouven Elbaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Reouven","lastName":"Elbaz","id":"37601621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2621-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2622-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1095-323X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-323X"}],"articleNumber":"4839503","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839503","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Satellites","Cryptography","Single event transient","Costs","Space vehicles","Security","Energy consumption","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","artificial satellites","cryptography","fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space applications","fault tolerant SHA-2 hash functions","satellites","cryptographic primitives","power consumption","FPGA implementation","TMR technique"]}],"abstract":"Satellites are extensively used by public and private sectors to support a variety of services. Considering the cost and the strategic importance of these spacecrafts, it is fundamental to utilize strong cryptographic primitives to assure their security. However, it is of utmost importance to consider fault tolerance in their designs due to the harsh environment found in space, while keeping low area and power consumption. Therefore, this paper proposes novel fault tolerant schemes for the SHA-2 family of hash functions and analyzes their resistance to SEUs. Results obtained through FPGA implementation show that our best fault tolerant scheme for SHA-512 uses up to 32% less area and consumes up to 43% less power than the commonly used TMR technique. Moreover, its memory and registers are 435 and 175 times more resistant to SEUs than TMR. These results are crucial for supporting low area and low power fault tolerant cryptographic primitives in satellites.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient fault tolerant SHA-2 hash functions for space applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient fault tolerant SHA-2 hash functions for space applications","htmlLink":"/document/4839503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10625395","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient fault tolerant SHA-2 hash functions for space applications","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z07_0102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118617S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4839506,"authors":[{"name":"Shankarnarayanan Ramaswamy","affiliation":["BAE Systems Avionics, Manassas, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4813823/4839294/4839506/4839506-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shankarnarayanan Ramaswamy is a senior engineer in the VLSI Customs Product Design and Development area at BAE Systems in Manassas VA.

For this reason, a disciplined approach incorporating root cause trees (Ishikawa Diagrams) is usually taken to develop and track root cause hypotheses and analyses. During the investigation, statistical tools can be used to evaluate various hypotheses of failure. However, in many cases, there is limited failure data and it is often necessary to set up accelerated life tests involving many samples in order to induce failures under controlled conditions so that a statistically significant population of failures can be obtained. Root cause is sometimes achieved only after extensive and expensive efforts to reduce the number of root cause hypotheses. Other times, root cause investigations are truncated to \"most probable cause\" based on the evidence available and expert opinion. Bayesian analysis allows test or observation data to be combined with prior information to produce a posterior estimate of likelihood. It can be a tool that provides a number of benefits to the root cause determination process. The first benefit is to provide an estimate of the likelihood that certain hypotheses are true based on the limited data available. This can provide useful direction to the failure investigation. For example, it can provide an indication as to where more data collection might be valuable, i.e., tests of most likely hypothesis as opposed to tests of all hypotheses in a root cause analysis. It also can provide a way to assess the incremental impact of data as it becomes available to the decision making process. Another benefit is to organize the logic, once root cause has been determined, that can lead to a more quantitative measure of the likelihood of a future failure. This latter benefit can help guide the decision making processes necessary for determining what corrective action (if any) might be necessary. This paper provides an elementary introduction to a Bayesian approach to data analysis for anomaly and failure investigations and provides a number of worked examples illustrating its utility.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839518","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839518.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of a Bayesian approach to anomaly and failure investigations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of a Bayesian approach to anomaly and failure investigations","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839518/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625410","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4839518/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits of a Bayesian approach to anomaly and failure investigations","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z07_0601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055691S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4839523,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Keyes","affiliation":["MesoScribe Technologies, Inc., Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4813823/4839294/4839523/4839523-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brian Keyes is a Project Engineer at MesaScribe Technologies and is currently managing the firm's SBIR program on conformal, embedded harsh environment sensors for in-situ sensing in gas turbines.

This paper describes methods for modelling decision variables, for enroute flight planning under visual flight rules (VFR). For demonstration purposes, the task of delivering a medical package to a remote location was chosen. Decision variables include fuel consumption, flight time, wind and weather conditions, terrain elevation, airspace classification and the flight trajectories of other aircraft. The decision variables are transformed, using a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) cost function, into a single cost value for a grid-based search algorithm (e.g. A*). It is shown that the proposed system provides a means for fast, autonomous generation of near-optimal flight plans, which in turn are a key enabler in the operation of UAVs in the NAS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-board multi-objective mission planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839608","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839608.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"On-board multi-objective mission planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839608/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625500","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-board multi-objective mission planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z09_0313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.188331S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4839639,"authors":[{"name":"Michael McCurdy","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4813823/4839294/4839639/4839639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael McCurdy is a researcher and designer in the Human-Computer Interaction group at NASA Ames.

Neural network models simulate the relationship between control (e.g., elevator, throttle, etc.) and human input (visual information) and can be analyzed mathematically. In previous research, only longitudinal operation was analyzed, because the characteristic flare maneuver is said to be one of the most difficult maneuvers in normal operations. However, lateral control is also difficult especially under crosswind conditions. In a crosswind approach, crab control is applied first, and then winglow sideslip control is applied. The transition process of these two controls is called decrab, which is recognized as quite a difficult maneuver. Moreover, the longitudinal control also depends on the lateral control, and the influence of this coupling deserves some interest, too. In this paper we focus on the lateral control analysis. As in the previous research, neural network plot models are investigated with sensitivity analysis. Several simulator experiments were conducted with different pilots and under various wind conditions, and the analysis results clarify the differences in control strategies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839640/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10625532","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839640/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of pilot landing control in crosswind using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of pilot landing control in crosswind using neural networks","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z10_0707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036276S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00 \u00a92009 IEEE.","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4839659,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Results acquired from an internal failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) study identified turn-to-turn winding faults as the primary mechanism, or mode, of failure. Physics-of-failure mechanisms used to develop a model for the identified fault are provided. The model was implemented in Simulink to simulate the dynamics of the motor with a turn-to-turn insulation winding fault. Then, an experimental test procedure was devised and executed to validate the model. Additionally, a diagnostic feature, identified by the fault model and derived using Hilbert transforms, was validated using the Simulink model and experimental data for several fault dimensions. Next, a feature extraction routine preprocesses monitoring parameters and passes the resulting features to a particle filter. The particle filter, based on Bayesian estimation theory, allows for representation and management of uncertainty in a computationally efficient manner. The resulting anomaly detection routine declares a fault only when a specified confidence level is reached at a given false alarm rate. Finally, the real-time performance of the anomaly detector is evaluated using LabVIEW.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839659.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle filter based anomaly detection for aircraft actuator systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle filters","Aircraft","Actuators","Fault diagnosis","Fault detection","Detectors","Brushless DC motors","Insulation","Context modeling","Failure analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aircraft control","aircraft instrumentation","aircraft power systems","Bayes methods","belief networks","brushless DC motors","computerised instrumentation","electric actuators","electromechanical effects","failure analysis","fault location","feature extraction","Hilbert transforms","machine insulation","machine windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filter based anomaly detection","brushless DC motor winding insulation faults","aircraft electromechanical actuator system","failure modes-and-effects analysis","FMEA","turn-to-turn insulation winding faults","physics-of-failure mechanism","Simulink model","Hilbert transforms","feature extraction routine preprocess","Bayesian estimation theory","LabVIEW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Particle filter based anomaly detection for aircraft actuator systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839659/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10625551","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle filter based anomaly detection for aircraft actuator systems","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z11_0302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078524S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4839671,"authors":[{"name":"P.

First, we develop a low-cost test-bed for simulating bearing faults in a motor. In Aerospace applications, it is important that motor fault signatures are identified before a failure occurs. It is known that 40% of mechanical failures occur due to bearing faults. Bearing faults can be identified from the motor vibration signatures. Second, we develop a wireless sensor module for collection of vibration data from the test-bed. Wireless sensors have been used because of their advantages over wired sensors in remote sensing. Finally, we use a novel two-stage neural network to classify various bearing faults. The first stage neural network estimates the principal components using the generalized Hebbian algorithm (GHA). Principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to extract the fault features. The second stage neural network uses a supervised learning vector quantization network (SLVQ) utilizing a self organizing map approach. This stage is used to classify various fault modes. Neural networks have been used because of their flexibility in terms of online adaptive reformulation. At the end, we discuss the performance of the proposed classification method.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2009.4839671","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2009.4839671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839294","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813823/4839294/04839671.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanical fault diagnosis using wireless sensor networks and a two-stage neural network classifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839671/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mechanical fault diagnosis using wireless sensor networks and a two-stage neural network classifier","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839671/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10625563","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-14 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-14 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical fault diagnosis using wireless sensor networks and a two-stage neural network classifier","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z11_0506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11228S","chronDate":"7-14 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4813823","isNumber":"4839294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813823","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4839294","articleId":"4839671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4839759,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Amrozik","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Amrozik","id":"37547350700"},{"name":"Lukasz Kotynia","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Lukasz","lastName":"Kotynia","id":"37671283100"},{"name":"Piotr Michalik","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Michalik","id":"37546839600"},{"name":"Mariusz Jankowski","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Mariusz","lastName":"Jankowski","id":"37398758000"},{"name":"Andrzej Napieralski","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Napieralski","id":"37284975000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-966-2191-05-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4839759","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Signal processing","Multiplexing","Delay","Timing","Logic devices","Reconfigurable logic","Communication switching","Silicon","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","logic design","microprocessor chips","multiplexing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal switchboxes","nanometer process","digital switchbox block","programmable digital device","automated approach","alternative multiplexer structures","full-custom multiplexer design","layout development strategies","microprocessor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switchbox","pass transistor logic","logic synthesis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839759","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference - The Experience of Designing and Application of CAD Systems in Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4813821/4839735/04839759.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839735","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Conference - The Experience of Designing and Application of CAD Systems in Microelectronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative design approach for signal switchboxes in nanometer process","abstract":"In this paper we are presenting an alternative approach to designing of the digital switchbox block which can be used as a part of programmable digital device.

Depending on the objective function values of the current and best solutions in the present iteration, unique and innovative formulae are designed for two sets of PSO parameters, inertia weight & learning factors, to make them adaptive. To enrich the searching behavior and to avoid being trapped into local optimum, CLS is incorporated treating each individual particle as separate entity. Considering recent necessity and to prove the robustness and better effectiveness of the Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) based algorithm, authors choose its application in power industry, as power flow has complex and non-linear characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published work on the CPSO to solve the power flow problems. PSO parameters are set to give better and reliable convergence characteristics for power flow under critical conditions like high R/X ratio and loadability limits. Conventional methods like Newton Raphson/Fast-decoupled load flow can not give multiple power flow solutions which are essential for voltage stability analysis. Proposed algorithm can overcome that limitation. The effectiveness and efficiency has been established showing results for standard and ill-conditioned systems.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4839945","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04839945.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4839945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization based reliable algorithm to overcome the limitations of conventional power flow methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Particle swarm optimization","Load flow","Robustness","Power industry","Voltage","Stability analysis","Power system analysis computing","Power system security","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic particle swarm optimization","reliable algorithm","conventional power flow methods","chaotic local search","power industry","Newton Raphson-fast-decoupled load flow","voltage stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive parameters","chaotic local search","critical conditions","particle swarm optimization","multiple power flow solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization based reliable algorithm to overcome the limitations of conventional power flow methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839945/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10588616","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization based reliable algorithm to overcome the limitations of conventional power flow methods","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058025S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4839945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4839954,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

This paper deals with three conflicting objective functions. These conflicting functions are: 1. Minimum harmonic current penetration into the electric grid system, 2. Maximum harmonic current absorption by the harmonic power filter, 3. Minimum harmonic voltage distortion at the point of common coupling, Throughout the optimization process, all power filter parameters are being treated as either continuous or discrete variables.

HEVs are currently commercially available and PHEVs will be the next phase in the evolution of hybrid and electric vehicles. The batteries of the PHEVs are designed to be charged at home, from a standard outlet in the garage, or on a corporate car park. The electrical consumption for charging PHEVs may take up to 5% of the total electrical consumption in Belgium by 2030. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid which is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. Firstly, the uncoordinated charging is described where the vehicles are charged immediately when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor. The optimal charge profile of the PHEVs is computed by minimizing the power losses. The exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, so stochastic programming is introduced.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04839973.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4839973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4839973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated charging of multiple plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in residential distribution grids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated charging of multiple plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in residential distribution grids","htmlLink":"/document/4839973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10588630","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated charging of multiple plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in residential distribution grids","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040749S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4839973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4839976,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Another way of optimal coordination program is using artificial intelligent system such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In this paper a new approach will be used for optimal coordination of OC relays based on particle swarm algorithm. In this work we take into account both time setting multiplier (TSM) and plug setting multiplier (PSM) of OC relays in optimization procedure. Most OC relays accept only discrete values as TSM and PSM, and you should change your final answers to discrete form and this may corrupt the optimization. In this paper the act of quantizing the answers is taken into account as a part of optimization procedure, so the outputs are optimized discrete TSM's and PSM's. In other words the novelty of the paper is taking into account the PSM in addition to TSM to handle miscoordination problems both for continues and discrete TSM and PSM. The results obtained are quite encouraging and will be useful as an effective tool for coordination OC relays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839976/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10614303","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4839976/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Overcurrent relays coordination using particle-swarm-optimization algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Overcurrent relays coordination using particle-swarm-optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060054S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4839976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":4839981,"authors":[{"name":"Zhousheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhousheng Zhang received the B.Sc. degree in physics from Huazhong Normal University, China in 1992.

The proposed method can be applied to both on-line energized network (energized with power frequency voltage) and some offline energized network (energized with approximate power frequency voltage). This paper describes an adaptive extraction system (AES) which performs partition of original discrete sequences to more than one time-frames, implements DWT of each time-frame and identifies noise from PDs. AES tunes sets of thresholds according to obtained noise characteristics, and then it modifies DWT coefficients on different scales of DWT to separate noise from PDs. The AES approach produces a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and almost undistorted partial discharge pulse waveshape at the output of AES. Simulation and experiment studies associated with this AES approach are presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4839981","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04839981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4839981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet transform approach to adaptive extraction of partial discharge pulses from interferences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4839981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet transform approach to adaptive extraction of partial discharge pulses from interferences","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4839981/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614306","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4839981/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet transform approach to adaptive extraction of partial discharge pulses from interferences","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081195S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4839981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
