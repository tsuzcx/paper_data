This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a new framework for compliant motion control of multi-backbone continuum robots subject to whole-arm contacts. This control framework does not rely on knowledge of contact locations along the length of a continuum robot. Instead, the forces at joint level are applied as controller inputs to generate compliant motion. The paper first presents a new mapping of the external wrenches to a generalized force in the configuration space of a single-stage multi-backbone continuum robot. A closed-form analytic expression for the passive stiffness of a multi-backbone continuum robot segment is also presented. A controller, robust to uncertainties of the system model, is proposed to provide compliant motion of the continuum robot segment by using the generalized force and stiffness definitions. Stability, convergence, and controller properties are shown through experimental validation. The presented framework defines a method for providing compliant motion to continuum robots without explicit knowledge of the environment. We believe this work enables new control algorithms for rapidly deployable surgical robots and supports novel surgical paradigms by increasing safety during unstructured interaction with flexible anatomy.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980000","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980000.pdf","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compliant motion control for continuum robots with intrinsic actuation sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compliant motion control for continuum robots with intrinsic actuation sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12326454","htmlLink":"/document/5980000/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compliant motion control for continuum robots with intrinsic actuation sensing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065697S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980005,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Bajo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bajo","id":"37546526300"},{"name":"Roger E.

However, they suffer poor position tracking performance due to flexibility of their actuation lines, structural compliance, and actuation coupling effects between segments. The need for control methods addressing accurate tracking for multi segment continuum robots is magnified by increased precision requirements of surgical procedures employing these structures. To address this need, this paper proposes a tiered controller that uses both extrinsic and intrinsic sensory information for improved performance of multi-segment continuum robots. The higher tier of this controller uses configuration space feedback while the lower tier uses joint space feedback and a feed-forward term obtained with actuation compensation techniques. We prove the stability of this controller using Lyapunov's direct method and experimentally evaluate its performance on a three-segment multi-backbone continuum robot. Results demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing regulation and tracking performance. It is shown that the controller mitigates the effects of actuation coupling between robot's sub-segments and decreases phase lag. These results suggest that this tiered controller will enhance telemanipulation performance of multi-segment continuum robots.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980005","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980005.pdf","startPage":"2905","endPage":"2912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configuration and joint feedback for enhanced performance of multi-segment continuum robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Configuration and joint feedback for enhanced performance of multi-segment continuum robots","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12326459","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980005/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980005/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configuration and joint feedback for enhanced performance of multi-segment continuum robots","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099169S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980048,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Mainprice","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France","UPS, INSA, INP, ISAE, LAAS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Mainprice","id":"37947362900"},{"name":"E.

These algorithms have been extensively validated in rigid human-made environments -indoor and outdoor- showing robust performance in dealing with clutter, occlusions or sudden motions. Medical endoscopic sequences naturally pose a monocular SLAM problem: an unknown camera motion in an unknown environment. The corresponding map would be useful in providing 3D information to assist surgeons, to support augmented reality insertions or to be exploited by medical robots. In this paper we propose the combination EKF Monocular SLAM + 1-Point RANSAC + Randomised List Relocalization to process laparoscopic sequences -abdominal cavity images-. The sequences are challenging due to: 1) cluttering produced by tools; 2) sudden motions of the camera; 3) laparoscope frequently goes in and out of abdominal cavity; 4) tissue deformation caused by respiration, heartbeats and/or surgical tools. Real medical image sequences provide experimental validation.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"4816","endPage":"4821","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980059","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980059.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EKF monocular SLAM with relocalization for laparoscopic sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980059/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"EKF monocular SLAM with relocalization for laparoscopic sequences","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12326476","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980059/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EKF monocular SLAM with relocalization for laparoscopic sequences","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062077S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980070,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Gribovskaya","affiliation":["Learning Algo-rithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA), EPF Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Gribovskaya","id":"37679917300"},{"name":"Abderrahmane Kheddar","affiliation":["AIST, JRL, UMI3218/CRT, CNRS, Japan","AIST, JRL, UMI3218/CRT, CNRS, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Abderrahmane","lastName":"Kheddar","id":"37293875300"},{"name":"Aude Billard","affiliation":["Learning Algo-rithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA), EPF Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Aude","lastName":"Billard","id":"37273980800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980070","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1905},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Force","Adaptation models","Robot kinematics","Kinematics","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control engineering computing","electric variables control","human-robot interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion learning","adaptive impedance","robot control","human physical interaction","adaptive control","collaborative task","planar 2-DOF robots"]}],"abstract":"This article combines programming by demonstration and adaptive control for teaching a robot to physically interact with a human in a collaborative task requiring sharing of a load by the two partners.

To compensate for unmodelled uncertainties, in addition to learning we propose an adaptive control algorithm that tunes the impedance parameters, so as to ensure accurate reproduction.

Applying pressure to the surface of the elastomer deforms the cross-section of underlying microchannels and changes the electrical resistance across the affected channels. Perpendicular conductive channels form a quasi-planar network within an elastomeric matrix that registers the location, intensity and duration of applied pressure. Pressing channel intersections of the keypad triggers one of twelve keys, allowing the user to write any combination of alphabetic letters. A 5% change in channel output voltage must be achieved to trigger a key. It is found that approximately 100 kPa of pressure is necessary to produce a 5% change in voltage across a conductive microchannel that is 20 microns in height and 200 microns in width.

It is hypothesized that this will give to the robot high versatility to cope with unpredictable disturbance ranging from small uneven terrain variations to unexpected collisions or even accidental falls. As part of the AMARSI European project, the passive compliance of this newly developed robot will be exploited for safer interaction, energy efficient and more aggressive damage-safe learning. The passive compliant actuation module used is a compact unit based on the series elastic actuator principle (SEA). In addition to the passive compliance the \u201ccCub \u201ddesign includes other significant updates over the original prototype such as full joint state sensing including joint torque sensing and improved range of motion and torque capabilities.

Traditionally, a human inspector detects cracks using his/her eyes and finds the location of cracks manually.

In this method, the Laplacian of Gaussian algorithm is used to detect cracks and the global crack map is obtained through camera calibration and robot localization. To ensure that the robot collects all the images on the bridge deck, we develop a complete coverage path planning algorithm for the mobile robot. We compare it with other path planning strategies.

Instead, our method first classifies the type of indoor environment the MAV is in, and then uses vision algorithms based on perspective cues to estimate the desired direction to fly. We test our method on two MAV platforms: a co-axial miniature helicopter and a toy quadrotor. Our experiments show that our vision algorithms are quite reliable, and they enable our MAVs to fly in a variety of corridors and staircases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980136/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12375468","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980136/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous MAV flight in indoor environments using single image perspective cues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous MAV flight in indoor environments using single image perspective cues","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063652S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5980137,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez-Perdomo","affiliation":["Institute of Sistemas Inteligentes y Aplicaciones Num\u00e9ricas en Ingenier\u00eda (SIANI), Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Perdomo","id":"38278055000"},{"name":"Jorge Cabrera-G\u00e1mez","affiliation":["Institute of Sistemas Inteligentes y Aplicaciones Num\u00e9ricas en Ingenier\u00eda (SIANI), Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Cabrera-G\u00e1mez","id":"38275127200"},{"name":"Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez-Sosa","affiliation":["Institute of Sistemas Inteligentes y Aplicaciones Num\u00e9ricas en Ingenier\u00eda (SIANI), Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez-Sosa","id":"38277652200"},{"name":"Josep Isern-Gonz\u00e1lez","affiliation":["Institute of Sistemas Inteligentes y Aplicaciones Num\u00e9ricas en Ingenier\u00eda (SIANI), Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Isern-Gonz\u00e1lez","id":"38270659500"},{"name":"Antonio C.

Gliders are a type of UUV particularly suitable for long-range missions because of their large autonomy. They change their buoyancy to dive and climb describing a vertical saw tooth pattern, which produces an effective but low horizontal speed. Consequently, gliders are strongly sensitive to ocean currents, so they might have to adapt the heading to the current field. In this article we outline a novel path planning algorithm for gliders using ocean currents. It bases on the A* family of algorithms and incorporates a probabilistic framework. Our approach intends to alleviate some of the drawbacks that A* has with the problem at hand. Instead of discretizing the search space, a set of bearing angles is sampled at each surfacing point and the glider trajectory is integrated. We propose an Adaptive Bearing Sampling (ABS) procedure which reduces the computational time with low impact on the results, as shown by the tests run with ocean currents of a Regional Ocean Model.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980137","startPage":"2350","endPage":"2355","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980137.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Bearing Sampling for a Constant-Time Surfacing A* path planning algorithm for gliders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Bearing Sampling for a Constant-Time Surfacing A* path planning algorithm for gliders","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980137/","accessionNumber":"12375469","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980137/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Bearing Sampling for a Constant-Time Surfacing A* path planning algorithm for gliders","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068092S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5980139,"authors":[{"name":"Cagdas D.

Recently, learning algorithms have been successfully applied to grasp novel objects-ones not seen by the robot before. While these approaches use low-dimensional representations such as a `grasping point' or a `pair of points' that are perhaps easier to learn, they only partly represent the gripper configuration and hence are sub-optimal. We propose to learn a new `grasping rectangle' representation: an oriented rectangle in the image plane. It takes into account the location, the orientation as well as the gripper opening width. However, inference with such a representation is computationally expensive. In this work, we present a two step process in which the first step prunes the search space efficiently using certain features that are fast to compute. For the remaining few cases, the second step uses advanced features to accurately select a good grasp. In our extensive experiments, we show that our robot successfully uses our algorithm to pick up a variety of novel objects.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980145","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980145.pdf","startPage":"3304","endPage":"3311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient grasping from RGBD images: Learning using a new rectangle representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980145/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient grasping from RGBD images: Learning using a new rectangle representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12375477","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980145/","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient grasping from RGBD images: Learning using a new rectangle representation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135355S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5980152,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Representative missions include marine habitat mapping, pipeline inspection, and archaeological surveying. Central to the operation of some classes of AUVs is the availability of good underwater positioning systems to localize one or more vehicles simultaneously based on information received on-board a support ship or a set of autonomous surface vehicles. In an interesting operational scenario the AUV is equipped with an acoustic pinger and the set of surface vehicles carry a network of acoustic receivers that measure the ranges between the emitter and each of the receivers. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of an acoustic sensor network at the ocean surface that will maximize the range-related information available for underwater target positioning. It is assumed that the range measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, the variance of which is distance-dependent. Furthermore, we also assume that an initial estimate of the target position is available, albeit with uncertainty. The Fisher Information Matrix and the maximization of its determinant are used to determine the sensor configuration that yields the most accurate \u201cexpected\u201d positioning of the target, the position of which is expressed by a probabilistic distribution. It is shown that the optimal configuration lends itself to an interesting geometrical interpretation and that the \u201cspreading\u201d of the sensor configuration depends explicitly on the intensity of the range measurement noise, the probabilistic distribution that defines the target position, and the target depth. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980152.pdf","startPage":"2308","endPage":"2314","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980152","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980152","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Noise","Noise measurement","Sea measurements","Position measurement","Sea surface","Acoustic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","inspection","matrix algebra","mobile robots","position control","remotely operated vehicles","surveying","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal sensor placement","underwater positioning","target location","autonomous underwater vehicles","AUV","marine habitat mapping","pipeline inspection","archaeological surveying","acoustic sensor network","white Gaussian noise","Fisher information matrix","probabilistic distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980152/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal sensor placement for underwater positioning with uncertainty in the target location","accessionNumber":"12375484","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5980152/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal sensor placement for underwater positioning with uncertainty in the target location","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049097S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5980153,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Muja","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Muja","id":"37401780200"},{"name":"Radu Bogdan Rusu","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Radu Bogdan","lastName":"Rusu","id":"37393726300"},{"name":"Gary Bradski","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Bradski","id":"37271063000"},{"name":"David G.

Since objects vary considerably in surface properties, rigidity and articulation, no single detector or object estimation method has been shown to provide reliable detection across object types to date. This indicates the need for an architecture that is able to quickly swap detectors, pose estimators, and filters, or to run them in parallel or serial and combine their results, preferably without any code modifications at all. In this paper, we present our implementation of such an infrastructure, ReIn (REcognition INfrastructure), to answer these needs. ReIn is able to combine a multitude of 2D/3D object recognition and pose estimation techniques in parallel as dynamically loadable plugins. It also provides an extremely efficient data passing architecture, and offers the possibility to change the parameters and initial settings of these techniques during their execution. In the course of this work we introduce two new classifiers designed for robot perception needs: BiGGPy (Binarized Gradient Grid Pyramids) for scalable 2D classification and VFH (Viewpoint Feature Histograms) for 3D classification and pose. We then show how these two classifiers can be easily combined using ReIn to solve object recognition and pose identification problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REIN - A fast, robust, scalable REcognition INfrastructure","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980153","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980153.pdf","startPage":"2939","endPage":"2946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"REIN - A fast, robust, scalable REcognition INfrastructure","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980153/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12375485","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REIN - A fast, robust, scalable REcognition INfrastructure","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049508S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5980181,"authors":[{"name":"Tae I.

The proof-of-concept device utilizes the principles of electrolysis of water, enhanced by the inclusion of an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) membrane as a medium. The device design incorporates an artificial bladder where the volume of gas generated by electrolysis is controlled by a solenoid valve, thus changing the device's buoyancy. A set of gold electrodes, separated by an IPMC film, is used as a lightweight and compact electrolysis generator. IPMC acts as stable, low power, highly efficient and environmentally friendly gas generator. Experimental results using open-loop control show that the device is capable of controlling its buoyancy efficiently with no noise and low power consumption. Applications for this technology include integration into bio-inspired, unmanned underwater vehicles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel electroactive polymer buoyancy control device for bio-inspired underwater vehicles","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980181","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980181.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel electroactive polymer buoyancy control device for bio-inspired underwater vehicles","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980181/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12375513","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel electroactive polymer buoyancy control device for bio-inspired underwater vehicles","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04417S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980185,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Hebert","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Hebert","id":"37586344200"},{"name":"Nicolas Hudson","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Hudson","id":"37407757300"},{"name":"Jeremy Ma","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Ma","id":"37539739100"},{"name":"Joel Burdick","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Burdick","id":"37265975700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980185","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":988},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Joints","Estimation","Mathematical model","Wrist","Cameras","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulators","estimation theory","force sensors","object detection","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo vision","force-torque sensor","in-hand object location estimation","joint angle encoder measurement","object 6D pose","finger contact location","wrist-to-camera transform","discrete state","finger contact mode","Barrett Hand","Bumblebee 2 stereo camera","ATI omega"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980185","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980185","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","abstract":"This paper develops a method to fuse stereo vision, force-torque sensor, and joint angle encoder measurements to estimate and track the location of a grasped object within the hand.

The VS joints developed at DLR show very low intrinsic damping for efficient energy storage and retrieval whereas the desired damping behavior for task execution needs to be implemented in control. Robotic arms with multiple VS joints, as for example the DLR Hand Arm System, ask for advanced control algorithms which can cope with the elastic joints and the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system properties of the mechanical setup.

One challenge is that human operators tend to follow different motion patterns, depending on their intention and the structure of the environment. This precludes the use of classical estimation techniques based on kinematic or dynamic models, especially for the purpose of long-term prediction. In this paper, we propose a method based on Hidden Markov Models to predict the region of the workspace that is possibly occupied by the human within a prediction horizon. In contrast to predictions in the form of single points such as most likely human positions as obtained from previous approaches, the regions obtained here may serve as safety constraints when the robot motion is planned or optimized. This way one avoids collisions with a probability not less than a predefined threshold. The practicability of our method is demonstrated by successfully and accurately predicting the motion of a human arm in two scenarios involving multiple motion patterns.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980248.pdf","startPage":"5875","endPage":"5880","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human arm motion modeling and long-term prediction for safe and efficient Human-Robot-Interaction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Humans","Robots","Safety","Predictive models","Trajectory","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","human-robot interaction","industrial robots","mobile robots","path planning","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human arm motion modeling","long term prediction","human robot interaction","industrial robot interaction","motion pattern","classical estimation technique","hidden Markov model","safety constraints","robot motion","multiple motion pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Human arm motion modeling and long-term prediction for safe and efficient Human-Robot-Interaction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980248/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12375579","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human arm motion modeling and long-term prediction for safe and efficient Human-Robot-Interaction","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08413S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5980250,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Padoy","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Padoy","id":"37393721100"},{"name":"Gregory D.

Using a natural division of tasks into subtasks, we propose a novel surgical Human-Machine Collaborative (HMC) system in which portions of a surgical task are performed autonomously under complete surgeon's control, and other portions manually. Our system automatically identifies the completion of a manual subtask, seamlessly executes the next automated task, and then returns control back to the surgeon. Our approach is based on learning from demonstration. It uses Hidden Markov Models for the recognition of task completion and temporal curve averaging for learning the executed motions. We demonstrate our approach using a da Vinci tele-surgical robot. We show on two illustrative tasks where such human-machine collaboration is intuitive that automated control improves the usage of the master manipulator workspace. Because such a system does not limit the traditional use of the robot, but merely enhances its capabilities while leaving full control to the surgeon, it provides a safe and acceptable solution for surgical performance enhancement.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980250.pdf","startPage":"5285","endPage":"5292","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980250","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980250","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980250","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Instruments","Trajectory","Robots","Needles","Surgery","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","human-robot interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","manipulators","medical robotics","surgery","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-machine collaborative surgery","learned model","teleoperated robotic surgery","hidden Markov models","da Vinci telesurgical robot","automated control","master manipulator workspace"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980250/","displayDocTitle":"Human-Machine Collaborative surgery using learned models","accessionNumber":"12375581","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5980250/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-Machine Collaborative surgery using learned models","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061743S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5980251,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen L.

The changing environment is modeled as an accumulation function which grows in areas that are not within range of the robot, and decreases in areas that are within range of the robot. The robot must continually move through the environment to prevent the accumulation of any area from growing unbounded. We consider the case in which a predefined path is given for the robot, and we focus on controlling the robot's speed along the path. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions on the speed controller of the robot for keeping the accumulation function bounded. We then search among the space of speed controllers that are parametrized by a finite set of basis functions. We develop a linear program to compute the optimal speed controller; that which minimizes the accumulation over the environment.

One surgeon serves as the primary surgeon and the other serves as his/her assistant. Surgical robotics have redefined the dynamics in which the two surgeons interact with each other and with the surgical site. Raven IV is a new generation of the surgical robot system having four articulated robotic arms in a spherical configuration, each holding an articulated surgical tool. The system allows two surgeons to teleoperate the Raven IV collaboratively from two remote sites. The current research effort aims to configure the link architecture of each robotic arm, along with the position (port placement) and orientation of the Raven IV with respect to the patient, in order to optimize the common workspace reachable by all four robotic arms. The simulation results indicate that tilting the base of the robotic arms in the range of -20 to 20 deg while moving the ports closer together up to 50 mm apart leads to a preferred circular shape of the common workspace with an isotropy value of 0.5.

The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory, which are then combined to produced an updated trajectory with lower cost. A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980280","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980280.pdf","startPage":"4569","endPage":"4574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STOMP: Stochastic trajectory optimization for motion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"STOMP: Stochastic trajectory optimization for motion planning","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980280/","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12375611","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980280/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STOMP: Stochastic trajectory optimization for motion planning","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057538S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"316","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5980282,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Jun Park","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, DLR - German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Jung-Jun","lastName":"Park","id":"37066804400"},{"name":"Sami Haddadin","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, DLR - German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Haddadin","id":"37542865300"},{"name":"Jae-Bok Song","affiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Laboratory, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea","Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, DLR - German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Jae-Bok","lastName":"Song","id":"37277430400"},{"name":"Alin Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, DLR - German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","id":"38270361100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980282","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":785},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980282","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Collision avoidance","Humans","Stress","Injuries","Force","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","collision avoidance","human-robot interaction","injuries","medical robotics","safety","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["safe robot surface","soft-tissue injury","physical human-robot interaction","safety criteria","skin injury criteria","stress distribution","biomechanical","cadaver experiments","collision model reliability"]}],"abstract":"Modeling of low severity soft-tissue injury due to unwanted collisions of a robot in collaborative settings is an important aspect to be treated in safe physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI).

However, for the design of an intrinsically safer robot arm, a reliable evaluation of the collision between a human and a robot that is based on skin injury criteria is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel human-robot collision model with and without covering, which is based on the impact stress distribution. The reliability of the proposed collision model is verified by a comparison with various cadaver experiments taken from existing biomechanical literature. Since the stress characteristics acting on the human head can be analyzed with this new collision model, the occurrence of certain soft-tissue injury can be estimated. Furthermore, the method serves for selecting the appropriate covering parameters, as e.g. elastic modulus and thickness, by evaluating the chosen skin injury indices.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980282","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980282.pdf","startPage":"5413","endPage":"5420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing optimally safe robot surface properties for minimizing the stress characteristics of human-robot collisions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Designing optimally safe robot surface properties for minimizing the stress characteristics of human-robot collisions","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12375613","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing optimally safe robot surface properties for minimizing the stress characteristics of human-robot collisions","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053244S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980285,"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.M.

We present the rapidly-exploring roadmap (RRM), a new method for single-query optimal motion planning that allows the user to explicitly consider the trade-off between exploration and refinement. RRM initially explores the configuration space like a rapidly exploring random tree (RRT). Once a path is found, RRM uses a user-specified parameter to weigh whether to explore further or to refine the explored space by adding edges to the current roadmap to find higher quality paths in the explored space. Unlike prior methods, RRM does not focus solely on exploration or refine prematurely. We demonstrate the performance of RRM and the trade-off between exploration and refinement using two examples, a point robot moving in a plane and a concentric tube robot capable of following curved trajectories inside patient anatomy for minimally invasive medical procedures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapidly-exploring roadmaps: Weighing exploration vs. refinement in optimal motion planning","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980286","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980286.pdf","startPage":"3706","endPage":"3712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rapidly-exploring roadmaps: Weighing exploration vs. refinement in optimal motion planning","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980286/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12375617","pubMedId":"22294046","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapidly-exploring roadmaps: Weighing exploration vs. refinement in optimal motion planning","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054117S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5980295,"authors":[{"name":"Marek Kopicki","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, UK"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Kopicki","id":"37947437800"},{"name":"Sebastian Zurek","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, UK"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Zurek","id":"37952694200"},{"name":"Rustam Stolkin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, UK"],"firstName":"Rustam","lastName":"Stolkin","id":"37424300500"},{"name":"Thomas M\u00f6rwald","affiliation":["Automation and Control Institute, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"M\u00f6rwald","id":"37599594400"},{"name":"Jeremy Wyatt","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, UK"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Wyatt","id":"37295577100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980295","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"abstract":"An important problem in robotic manipulation is the ability to predict how objects behave under manipulative actions. This ability is necessary to allow planning of object manipulations. Physics simulators can be used to do this, but they model many kinds of object interaction poorly. An alternative is to learn a motion model for objects by interacting with them. In this paper we address the problem of learning to predict the interactions of rigid bodies in a probabilistic framework, and demonstrate the results in the domain of robotic push manipulation. A robot arm applies random pushes to various objects and observes the resulting motion with a vision system. The relationship between push actions and object motions is learned, and enables the robot to predict the motions that will result from new pushes. The learning does not make explicit use of physics knowledge, or any pre-coded physical constraints, nor is it even restricted to domains which obey any particular rules of physics. We use regression to learn efficiently how to predict the gross motion of a particular object. We further show how different density functions can encode different kinds of information about the behaviour of interacting objects. By combining these as a product of densities, we show how learned predictors can cope with a degree of generalisation to previously unencountered object shapes, subjected to previously unencountered push directions. Performance is evaluated through a combination of virtual experiments in a physics simulator, and real experiments with a 5-axis arm equipped with a simple, rigid finger.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Robots","Physics","Predictive models","Equations","Three dimensional displays","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulators","manipulator kinematics","motion estimation","path planning","regression analysis","robot vision","shear modulus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rigid body interaction","probabilistic framework","robotic push manipulation","robot arm","vision system","push actions","object motion","regression analysis","gross motion prediction","density functions","performance evaluation","physics simulator","5-axis arm","rigid finger"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980295","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980295.pdf","startPage":"5722","endPage":"5729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to predict how rigid objects behave under simple manipulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to predict how rigid objects behave under simple manipulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980295/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980295/","accessionNumber":"12375626","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to predict how rigid objects behave under simple manipulation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052819S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5980297,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled M.

In this work, a mathematical analysis that describes the number of possible planar robot designs for optimally fault-tolerant Jacobians is presented. Two examples, one that is optimal to a single joint failure and the second that is optimal to two joint failures, are discussed.

The DLR Hand Arm System aims to match the skills of its natural archetype. For this purpose, the joints have to be extremely compact to fit into the arm. At the same time they require a high power density in order to approximate the human arm skills. The new DLR FSJ is designed completely from an energy based point of view.

The availability of preoperative imaging makes our approach particularly suited for neurosurgery, and we illustrate the method with the example of endoscopic choroid plexus ablation. A novel parameterization of the robot characteristics is used in conjunction with a global pattern search optimization method. The formulation returns the design of the least-complex robot capable of reaching single or multiple target points in a confined space with constrained optimization metrics. A particular advantage of this approach is that it identifies the need for either fixed-curvature versus variable-curvature sections.

In this paper, we analyze key challenges encountered when lifting a grasped object and transitioning into laden free-flight. We demonstrate that dynamic load disturbances introduced by the load mass will be rejected by a helicopter with PID flight control. We determine stability bounds in which the changing mass-inertia parameters of the system due to the grasped object will not destabilize this flight controller. The conditions under which transient partial contact mechanics of objects resting on a surface will not induce instability are identified.

As MAVs are highly agile, it is not sufficient to directly use the visual input for position control at the framerates that can be achieved with small onboard computers. Our contributions in this work are twofold. First, we present a solution to overcome the issue of having a low frequent onboard visual pose update versus the high agility of an MAV. This is solved by filtering visual information with inputs from inertial sensors. Second, as our system is based on monocular vision, we present a solution to estimate the metric visual scale aid of an air pressure sensor. All computation is running onboard and is tightly integrated on the MAV to avoid jitter and latencies. This framework enables stable flights indoors and outdoors even under windy conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980343","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980343.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980343","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"3056","endPage":"3063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Onboard IMU and monocular vision based control for MAVs in unknown in- and outdoor environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Onboard IMU and monocular vision based control for MAVs in unknown in- and outdoor environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980343/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980343/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12326239","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Onboard IMU and monocular vision based control for MAVs in unknown in- and outdoor environments","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066746S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5980345,"authors":[{"name":"Brian C.

In this paper, we derive a control law for position-based virtual fixtures within the framework of an active handheld micromanipulator, where the fixtures are generated in real-time from microscope video. Additionally, we develop motion scaling behavior centered on virtual fixtures as a simple and direct extension to our formulation.

Frictionless kinematic and quasistatic force models for this class of robots have been developed that incorporate bending and twisting of the tubes. Experimental evaluation of these models has revealed, however, a directional dependence of tube rotation on robot shape that is not predicted by these models. To explain this behavior, this paper models the contributions of friction arising from two sources: the distributed forces of contact between the tubes along their length and the concentrated bending moments generated at discontinuities in curvature and at the boundaries. It is shown that while friction due to distributed forces is insufficient to explain the experimentally observed tube twisting, a simple model of frictional torque arising from concentrated moments provides a good match with the experimental data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980347.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980347","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Friction modeling in concentric tube robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980347/","displayDocTitle":"Friction modeling in concentric tube robots","htmlLink":"/document/5980347/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12315745","pubMedId":"22358252","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Friction modeling in concentric tube robots","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083259S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980351,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In these cases, a set of nonlinear differential equations with boundary conditions must often be solved to obtain the robot shape. Thus, computing manipulator Jacobians and compliance matrices efficiently is not straight forward. In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining an arc length parametrized Jacobian and compliance matrix. Our approach involves obtaining an augmented Jacobian by propagating the necessary partial derivatives through the model equations, resulting in a new set of differential equations. These equations can be solved as an initial value problem, via a single numerical integration. Our method can be generally applied to various continuum robot architectures, regardless of the specific actuation system used. We provide a specific case study using this method to obtain the Jacobian for a concentric-tube robot.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980351","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980351.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing Jacobians and compliance matrices for externally loaded continuum robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Computing Jacobians and compliance matrices for externally loaded continuum robots","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5980351/","accessionNumber":"12315749","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing Jacobians and compliance matrices for externally loaded continuum robots","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049712S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980357,"authors":[{"name":"Shaojie Shen","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Shen","id":"37954847200"},{"name":"Nathan Michael","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Michael","id":"37302499000"},{"name":"Vijay Kumar","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37280341400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980357","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":231,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":5543},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Aerodynamics","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerodynamics","closed loop systems","floors","microrobots","mobile robots","position control","sensors","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microaerial vehicle","autonomous multifloor indoor navigation","computationally constrained MAV","mobile processor","onboard sensors","multifloor mapping","loop closure","localization","planning","autonomous control","aerodynamic effects"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomous navigation with a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) in indoor environments.

been developed at DLR. It is aimed to reach its human archetype regarding size, weight and performance. The main focus of our development is put on robustness, dynamic performance and dexterity. Therefore, a paradigm change from impedance controlled, but mechanically stiff joints to robots using intrinsic variable compliance joints is carried out. Collisions of the rigid joint robot at high speeds with stiff objects induce the energy too fast for an active controller to prevent damages. In contrast, passively compliant robots are able to temporarily store energy. In this case the resulting internal forces applied to the robot structure and the drive trains are reduced. Furthermore, the energy storage allows to outperform the dynamics of stiff robots. The hand drives and the electronics are completely integrated within the forearm. Extremely miniaturized electronics have been developed to drive the 52 motors of the system and interface their sensors. Several variable stiffness actuation principles used in the arm joints and the hand are presented. The paper highlights the different requirements that they have to fulfill. A first test of the systems robustness and dynamics has been performed by driving nails with a grasped hammer and is demonstrated in the attached video.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980371","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980371.pdf","startPage":"3175","endPage":"3182","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The DLR hand arm system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"The DLR hand arm system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5980371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12315769","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980371/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The DLR hand arm system","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082229S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5980377,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Lai","id":"37964374800"},{"name":"Liefeng Bo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Liefeng","lastName":"Bo","id":"37953619700"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Ren","affiliation":["INTEL, Research Laboratory, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Ren","id":"37531450000"},{"name":"Dieter Fox","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, USA","INTEL, Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Fox","id":"37284329000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980377","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1812},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided instruction","Shape","Visualization","Three dimensional displays","Accuracy","Object recognition","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance learning","image colour analysis","image sensors","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse distance learning","object recognition","RGB-D cameras","depth information","object category","view-to-object distance","group-lasso regularization","instance distance learning","RGB-D object dataset","RGB color"]}],"abstract":"In this work we address joint object category and instance recognition in the context of RGB-D (depth) cameras. Motivated by local distance learning, where a novel view of an object is compared to individual views of previously seen objects, we define a view-to-object distance where a novel view is compared simultaneously to all views of a previous object. This novel distance is based on a weighted combination of feature differences between views. We show, through jointly learning per-view weights, that this measure leads to superior classification performance on object category and instance recognition. More importantly, the proposed distance allows us to find a sparse solution via Group-Lasso regularization, where a small subset of representative views of an object is identified and used, with the rest discarded. This significantly reduces computational cost without compromising recognition accuracy. We evaluate the proposed technique, Instance Distance Learning (IDL), on the RGB-D Object Dataset, which consists of 300 object instances in 51 everyday categories and about 250,000 views of objects with both RGB color and depth. We empirically compare IDL to several alternative state-of-the-art approaches and also validate the use of visual and shape cues and their combination.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980377","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980377.pdf","startPage":"4007","endPage":"4013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse distance learning for object recognition combining RGB and depth information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980377/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse distance learning for object recognition combining RGB and depth information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12315775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980377/","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse distance learning for object recognition combining RGB and depth information","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098478S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5980382,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Lai","id":"37964374800"},{"name":"Liefeng Bo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Liefeng","lastName":"Bo","id":"37953619700"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Ren","affiliation":["INTEL, Research Laboratory, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Ren","id":"37531450000"},{"name":"Dieter Fox","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, USA","INTEL, Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Fox","id":"37284329000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980382","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":714,"citationCountPatent":59,"totalDownloads":6936},"abstract":"Over the last decade, the availability of public image repositories and recognition benchmarks has enabled rapid progress in visual object category and instance detection. Today we are witnessing the birth of a new generation of sensing technologies capable of providing high quality synchronized videos of both color and depth, the RGB-D (Kinect-style) camera. With its advanced sensing capabilities and the potential for mass adoption, this technology represents an opportunity to dramatically increase robotic object recognition, manipulation, navigation, and interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical multi-view object dataset collected using an RGB-D camera. The dataset contains 300 objects organized into 51 categories and has been made publicly available to the research community so as to enable rapid progress based on this promising technology. This paper describes the dataset collection procedure and introduces techniques for RGB-D based object recognition and detection, demonstrating that combining color and depth information substantially improves quality of results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980382.pdf","startPage":"1817","endPage":"1824","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A large-scale hierarchical multi-view RGB-D object dataset","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Videos","Video sequences","Three dimensional displays","Visualization","Object recognition","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image sensors","object recognition","robot vision","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale hierarchical multiview RGB-D object dataset","public image repositories","public image recognition","visual object category","instance detection","robotic object recognition","dataset collection procedure","RGB-D camera"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A large-scale hierarchical multi-view RGB-D object dataset","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12315780","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A large-scale hierarchical multi-view RGB-D object dataset","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066636S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"714","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5980391,"authors":[{"name":"Leslie Pack Kaelbling","affiliation":["CSAIL, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Leslie Pack","lastName":"Kaelbling","id":"37269373600"},{"name":"Tom\u00e1s Lozano-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["CSAIL, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tom\u00e1s","lastName":"Lozano-P\u00e9rez","id":"38273814000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980391","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":191,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1880},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Geometry","Grasping","Semantics","Concrete","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical task planning","motion planning","top-down fashion","continuous geometric representations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical task and motion planning in the now","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980391","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1477","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980391.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980391","abstract":"In this paper we outline an approach to the integration of task planning and motion planning that has the following key properties: It is aggressively hierarchical; it makes choices and commits to them in a top-down fashion in an attempt to limit the length of plans that need to be constructed, and thereby exponentially decrease the amount of search required.

A good representation has to account for two requirements: it should allow uncertain sensory fusion in a probabilistic way and it should serve as a basis for efficient grasp and motion generation. We consider Gaussian process implicit surface potentials as object shape representations. Sensory observations condition the Gaussian process such that its posterior mean defines an implicit surface which becomes an estimate of the object shape. Uncertain visual, haptic and laser data can equally be fused in the same Gaussian process shape estimate. The resulting implicit surface potential can then be used directly as a basis for a reach and grasp controller, serving as an attractor for the grasp end-effectors and steering the orientation of contact points. Our proposed controller results in a smooth reach and grasp trajectory without strict separation of phases. We validate the shape estimation using Gaussian processes in a simulation on randomly sampled shapes and the grasp controller on a real robot with 7DoF arm and 7DoF hand.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980395","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980395.pdf","startPage":"2845","endPage":"2850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian process implicit surfaces for shape estimation and grasping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980395/","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian process implicit surfaces for shape estimation and grasping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12315793","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980395/","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian process implicit surfaces for shape estimation and grasping","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14287S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5980409,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Mellinger","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Mellinger","id":"37542821400"},{"name":"Vijay Kumar","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37280341400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980409","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":807,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":16600},"abstract":"We address the controller design and the trajectory generation for a quadrotor maneuvering in three dimensions in a tightly constrained setting typical of indoor environments.

Their desirable properties, however, depend on the availability of an appropriate metric, which is often difficult to be defined for some robots, such as non-holonomic and under-actuated ones. This paper investigates a methodology to approximate optimum cost-to-go metrics by employing an offline learning phase in an obstacle-free workspace. The proposed method densely samples a graph that approximates the connectivity properties of the state space. This graph can be used online to compute approximate distances between states using nearest neighbor queries and standard graph search algorithms, such as A*. Unfortunately, this process significantly increases the online cost of a sampling-based planner. This work then investigates ways for the computationally efficient utilization of the learned metric during the planner's online operation. One idea is to map the sampled states into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space through multi-dimensional scaling that retains the relative distances represented by the sampled graph. Simulations on a first-order car and on an illustrative example of an asymmetric state space indicate that the approach has merit and can lead into more effective planning.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980427","startPage":"4196","endPage":"4201","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980427.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning approximate cost-to-go metrics to improve sampling-based motion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning approximate cost-to-go metrics to improve sampling-based motion planning","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980427/","accessionNumber":"12315825","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980427/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning approximate cost-to-go metrics to improve sampling-based motion planning","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054929S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5980431,"authors":[{"name":"Shervin Javdani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shervin","lastName":"Javdani","id":"37947170100"},{"name":"Sameep Tandon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sameep","lastName":"Tandon","id":"37950254600"},{"name":"Jie Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37535180800"},{"name":"James F.

paper presents a novel nano-injection method by nanoprobe insertion based on environmental-scanning electron microscope (E-SEM) under hybrid microscope. The hybrid microscope is designed to combine the optical microscope (OM) and E-SEM to realize biological specimen analysis by optical imaging including fluorescent imaging, and nano-scale manipulation by E-SEM imaging. Based on the bio-nano manipulation system, we propose a nano-injection method by nanoprobe insertion. The nanoprobe is designed to have a sharp tip to insert the probe into biological specimen. It is fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) process. The nano-scale size is important for minimal damage to biological specimen. The Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is used as a target biological specimen, which is one of the important model organism for diseases analysis. The nano-injection technique is needed to transport fluorescent materials or specific biological organism into specific cell for in-vivo experiment. The proposed system is considered to be important as future nano-surgery system for life innovation using model organism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12315832","htmlLink":"/document/5980434/","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Direct nano-injection method by nanoprobe insertion based on E-SEM nanorobotic manipulation under hybrid microscope","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct nano-injection method by nanoprobe insertion based on E-SEM nanorobotic manipulation under hybrid microscope","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07591S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980446,"authors":[{"name":"Edgar Lobaton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Edgar","lastName":"Lobaton","id":"37640010300"},{"name":"Jinghe Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jinghe","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37601207200"},{"name":"Sachin Patil","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Patil","id":"37402426300"},{"name":"Ron Alterovitz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Alterovitz","id":"37320259800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980446","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"abstract":"We present a new sampling-based method for planning optimal, collision-free, curvature-constrained paths for nonholonomic robots to visit multiple goals in any order. Rather than sampling configurations as in standard sampling based planners, we construct a roadmap by sampling circles of constant curvature and then generating feasible transitions between the sampled circles. We provide a closed-form formula for connecting the sampled circles in 2D and generalize the approach to 3D workspaces. We then formulate the multi goal planning problem as finding a minimum directed Steiner tree over the roadmap. Since optimally solving the multi-goal planning problem requires exponential time, we propose greedy heuristics to efficiently compute a path that visits multiple goals. We apply the planner in the context of medical needle steering where the needle tip must reach multiple goals in soft tissue, a common requirement for clinical procedures such as biopsies, drug delivery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. We demonstrate that our multi-goal planner significantly decreases tissue that must be cut when compared to sequential execution of single-goal plans.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Needles","Planning","Bridges","Joining processes","Robot kinematics","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","collision avoidance","directed graphs","mathematical programming","medical robotics","needles","sampling methods","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curvature-constrained path planning","optimal path planning","collision-free path planning","nonholonomic robots","constant curvature circle sampling","3D workspaces","multigoal planning problem","minimum directed Steiner tree","medical needle steering","soft tissue","clinical procedures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980446","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980446.pdf","startPage":"1463","endPage":"1469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning curvature-constrained paths to multiple goals using circle sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Planning curvature-constrained paths to multiple goals using circle sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980446/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980446/","accessionNumber":"12315844","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","pubMedId":"22294101","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning curvature-constrained paths to multiple goals using circle sampling","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068091S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5980467,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Rodriguez","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37277219700"},{"name":"Jory Denny","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jory","lastName":"Denny","id":"37947351200"},{"name":"Juan Burgos","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Burgos","id":"38180009300"},{"name":"Aditya Mahadevan","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Mahadevan","id":"37968660000"},{"name":"Kasra Manavi","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kasra","lastName":"Manavi","id":"37947352500"},{"name":"Luke Murray","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Luke","lastName":"Murray","id":"37947731100"},{"name":"Anton Kodochygov","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Kodochygov","id":"37947353000"},{"name":"Takis Zourntos","affiliation":["Parasol Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Takis","lastName":"Zourntos","id":"37394353600"},{"name":"Nancy M.

Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor \"anytime\" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods.

The system is small in size, capable of being mounted onto and demounted from an SEM through the specimen exchange chamber without breaking the high vacuum of the SEM. This advance eliminates frequent opening of the high-vacuum chamber, thus, incurs less contamination to the SEM, avoids lengthy pumping, and significantly eases the exchange of end-effectors (e.g., nano probes and grippers). The system consists of two independent 3-DOF Cartesian nanomanipulators based on piezo motors and piezo actuators.

Because an autonomous vehicle is kinematically constrained and has finite energy and communication resources, it is an open question how to best design missions for CS reconstruction. We compare a two-dimensional random walk, a TSP approximation to pass through random points, and a randomized boustrophedon (lawnmower) strategy. Not unexpectedly, all three approaches can yield comparable reconstruction performance if the planning horizons are long enough; if planning occurs only over short time scales, the random walk will have an advantage.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980497.pdf","startPage":"2362","endPage":"2367","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mission design for compressive sensing with mobile robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Sea measurements","Temperature measurement","Motion measurement","Compressed sensing","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","mobile robots","path planning","random processes","sampling methods","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mission design","mobile robots","spatial sampling","static environmental field","compressive sensing","compressible fields","nonadaptive measurement","random uncorrelated measurement","autonomous vehicle","finite energy resource","communication resource","CS reconstruction","two-dimensional random walk","TSP approximation","randomized boustrophedon strategy","travelling salesman problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mission design for compressive sensing with mobile robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980497/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12315894","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mission design for compressive sensing with mobile robots","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062541S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5980508,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Bry","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Bry","id":"37969339700"},{"name":"Nicholas Roy","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274058700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980508","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":223,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3004},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980508","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Trajectory","Uncertainty","Equations","Planning","Vehicle dynamics","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","mobile robots","path planning","probability","random processes","search problems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion planning","state uncertainty","nontrivial dynamics","spatially varying measurement properties","obstacle constraints","linear estimator","linear controller","nominal trajectory","bounded collision probability","state space","search tree","optimal path","information gathering","rapidly exploring random belief trees"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of motion planning in the presence of state uncertainty, also known as planning in belief space. The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efficiently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and finding low cost paths.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980508","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980508.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"730","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapidly-exploring Random Belief Trees for motion planning under uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rapidly-exploring Random Belief Trees for motion planning under uncertainty","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5980508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12315905","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapidly-exploring Random Belief Trees for motion planning under uncertainty","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084142S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":5980538,"authors":[{"name":"Anca D.

Based on the definition of dynamic residual signals, we derive stiffness estimation methods that use only position and velocity measurements on the motor side and needs only the knowledge of the dynamic parameters of the motors. In particular, no extra force/torque sensing is needed. Two different strategies are considered, a model-based stiffness estimator and a black-box stiffness estimator. Both strategies consist of two stages. The first stage of the model-based estimator generates a residual signal that is a first-order filtered version of the flexibility torque of the transmission, while in the second stage a least squares fitting method is used to estimate the model parameters of the stiffness. The black-box estimator uses in the first stage a second-order residual that is directly a filtered version of the stiffness multi plied by the deformation rate of the transmission. In the second stage, a simple regressor provides the transmission stiffness in a singularity-robust way. Numerical results reported for the cases of constant, nonlinear, or variable stiffness transmissions demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and the relative merits of the two estimation strategies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Estimation","Joints","Robot sensing systems","Least squares approximation","Gravity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elasticity","least squares approximations","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation","position measurement","regression analysis","robot dynamics","robot kinematics","torque control","velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual-based stiffness estimation","nonlinear stiffness estimation","robot joints","dynamic residual signals","position measurement","velocity measurement","dynamic motor parameters","model-based stiffness estimator","black-box stiffness estimator","flexibility transmission torque","least squares fitting method","model parameter estimation","second-order residual","regressor"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980541","startPage":"5541","endPage":"5547","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980541.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residual-based stiffness estimation in robots with flexible transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Residual-based stiffness estimation in robots with flexible transmissions","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12315938","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5980541/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual-based stiffness estimation in robots with flexible transmissions","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080036S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5980549,"authors":[{"name":"Sven Parusel","affiliation":["German AeroSpace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Parusel","id":"37587057600"},{"name":"Sami Haddadin","affiliation":["German AeroSpace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Haddadin","id":"37542865300"},{"name":"Alin Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","affiliation":["German AeroSpace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","id":"38270361100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980549","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":647},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Collision avoidance","Safety","Real time systems","Robot sensing systems","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automata theory","human-robot interaction","lightweight structures","robot programming","safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular state-based behavior control","human-robot interaction safety","lightweight control architecture","lightweight robot","human-friendly behavior","intuitive state based programming","soft-robotics features","flexible hybrid state automata","complex robot behavior programming","safety critical aspects","real-time robot control","reactive reflexes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980549","abstract":"In this paper we present a novel control architecture for realizing human-friendly behaviors and intuitive state based programming.

When robots become capable to perform sensor-guided and sensor-guarded motions, there is no predefined path anymore, and motions have to be calculated online, that is, during the motion. The Reflexxes Motion Libraries calculate jerk-limited motions within one control cycle only (typically 1 ms or less). This way, robots can instantaneously react to unforeseen sensor events, which opens the door to a huge number of new robot capabilities and fundamentally new motion control features. For instance: unforeseen switchings of coordinate frames, unforeseen switchings of control state spaces, deterministic and instantaneous reactions to sensor signals, safe and stable reactions to sensor failures, simple visual servo control, and stable switched-system control. All these features are important for the execution of sensor-based robot motions and to realize new applications as will be outlined in this paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979525","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967842/5979525/05980578.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980578","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opening the door to new sensor-based robot applications\u2014The Reflexxes Motion Libraries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980578/","displayDocTitle":"Opening the door to new sensor-based robot applications\u2014The Reflexxes Motion Libraries","htmlLink":"/document/5980578/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12315974","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opening the door to new sensor-based robot applications\u2014The Reflexxes Motion Libraries","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"icra11comm2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058926S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967842","isNumber":"5979525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967842","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5979525","articleId":"5980578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5980584,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Parness","affiliation":["NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Parness","id":"37546474700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-386-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"CD","value":"1050-4729"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5980584","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":657},"abstract":"An omni-directional anchoring mechanism is presented that can withstand forces greater than 100 N on natural rock surfaces.

A typical Google-like infrastructure of cloud computing is usually supported by the following three technologies: a scalable distributed file system like GFS, a structured key-value data store mechanism like Bigtable, and a parallel programming model like MapReduce.

It discusses the design, structure, retrieval and comparison of the index model. The spatial retrieval contains four types: point retrieval, range retrieval, topological retrieval and special grid retrieval. This paper also introduces the design of a prototype system implementing the proposed model, which consists of storage and server layer, service layer, management layer, and application layer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An index model of global subdivision in cloud computing environment","publicationTitle":"2011 19th International Conference on Geoinformatics","doi":"10.1109/GeoInformatics.2011.5980904","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th International Conference on Geoinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5961996/5980662/05980904.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GeoInformatics.2011.5980904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5980904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An index model of global subdivision in cloud computing environment","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5980904/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173299","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An index model of global subdivision in cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104656S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5961996","isNumber":"5980662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5961996","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5980662","articleId":"5980904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5981095,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanfei Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science, Ministry of Education, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuanfei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37966620300"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Geography and Resource Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37067291200"},{"name":"Wen Fu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science, Ministry of Education, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37958675300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-848-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-849-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-847-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0258"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-024X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-024X"}],"articleNumber":"5981095","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981095","abstract":"Tropical Cyclone (TC) track prediction is still a big and unsolved problem from the perspectives of theory and application due to the complicated and non-linear physical mechanisms and lack of calculating capabilities and observations.

The extension of this approach to decode convolutional codes and turbo codes is discussed in this article. The switching activity sensitivity is circumvented and the latching problem is reduced by transforming the stochastic additions into stochastic multiplications in the exponential domain and using multiple streams with deterministic shufflers. The number of decoding cycles is thus considerably reduced with no performance degradation. Stochastic decoding, previously applied to the decoding of LDPC codes, can now be applied to decoding of turbo codes. In addition, the first hardware architecture for stochastic decoding of turbo codes is presented. The proposed architecture makes fully-parallel turbo decoding viable on FPGA devices.

It provides also an implemented motion detection scheme useful for many applications especially those of surveillance. The main purpose of this work is to reduce power dissipation and time waste due to the readout of a huge amount of redundant data outgoing from the sensor through analog to digital converter (ADC). The circuit can perform averaging of the output signals of a block of (NxN) pixels, where N must be predefined as a function of the desired sensor resolution. A fast scan, of these mean values, followed by conversion and storage in digital memory arrays must be established. Afterwards, a comparison between the previous memorized array and the current one is performed. This comparison permits to control the generation of the addresses of the blocks that must be completely read in order to reconstruct an image with high resolution. The circuit is designed in the CMOS 0.35 \u03bcm AMS technology. The electrical simulation is given along with the emulation results done with MATLAB. As a result, we obtain a logarithmic image sensor with a pixel area of 14.3 \u00d7 14.3 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and a dataflow reduction more than 55%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981216.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart readout technique designed for logarithmic CMOS image sensor including a motion detection scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","Motion detection","CMOS image sensors","Image resolution","Transient analysis","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS image sensors","mathematics computing","readout electronics","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart readout technique","logarithmic CMOS image sensor","motion detection scheme","surveillance","power dissipation reduction","analog-digital converter","ADC","sensor resolution","CMOS","AMS technology","Matlab","dataflow reduction","size 0.35 mum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Smart readout technique designed for logarithmic CMOS image sensor including a motion detection scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981216/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12179684","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart readout technique designed for logarithmic CMOS image sensor including a motion detection scheme","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"a2la39266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115782S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5981217,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Lahmiri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Quebec, Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Salim","lastName":"Lahmiri","id":"37706926900"},{"name":"Mounir Boukadoum","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Quebec, Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Boukadoum","id":"37276338100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-137-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-135-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-136-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981217","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gabor filters","Discrete wavelet transforms","Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Cancer","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","cancer","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","Gabor filters","image classification","mammography","medical image processing","polynomials","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid discrete wavelet transform","Gabor filter banks processing","mammogram","feature extraction","breast cancer screening system","spatial orientations","support vector machine","polynomial kernel","classification"]}],"abstract":"A new methodology to automatically extract features from mammograms is presented. The approach is based on a combination of the discrete wavelet transform and the Gabor filter, and it can be easily implemented in a breast cancer screening system. First, the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform is employed to process the mammogram and obtain its HH high frequency sub-band image. Then, a Gabor filter bank is applied to the latter at different frequencies and spatial orientations to obtain new Gabor images from which the average and standard deviation are computed. Finally, these statistics are fed to a support vector machine with polynomial kernel to classify normal versus cancer mammograms.

But, most of these researches pay attention on the clustered logic block's fine-grain power gating which increases the FPGA size significantly. This paper presents a fast placement algorithm for coarse-grain FPGAs architecture, by which the circuit with multiple power domains is mapped into several regions for low power consumption. Each region uses one or several sleep transistors in order to conserve leakage energy. Using the CAD framework, we discuss the power efficiency of sleep region FPGA architecture by using the benchmarks assumed in multiple power domains. Simulation result shows that 9.1% power consumption of FPGA can be reduced on average by the proposed placement algorithm, compared to the traditional algorithm. Furthermore, when the dual power domains are individually power-on and -off, our proposed method can reduce the power more than 20%.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981221.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New power-efficient FPGA design combining with region-constrained placement and multiple power domains","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"New power-efficient FPGA design combining with region-constrained placement and multiple power domains","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173821","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981221/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New power-efficient FPGA design combining with region-constrained placement and multiple power domains","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"a2lb39068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062272S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981223,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos L.

The multichannel stimulator presented here can be used in many other microfluidic experiments and devices focused on particle trapping, separation and characterization.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981242","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981242.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application specific multi-channel stimulator for electrokinetically-driven microfluidic devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981242/","displayDocTitle":"An application specific multi-channel stimulator for electrokinetically-driven microfluidic devices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173837","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981242/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application specific multi-channel stimulator for electrokinetically-driven microfluidic devices","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"b4pc099149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055331S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981243,"authors":[{"name":"Shota Shirai","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Shota","lastName":"Shirai","id":"37952924800"},{"name":"Masaki Nakai","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Nakai","id":"37957012400"},{"name":"Takeshi Kumaki","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Kumaki","id":"37297414500"},{"name":"Tomohiro Fujita","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37403610300"},{"name":"Mamoru Nakanishi","affiliation":["NTT Microsystem Integration Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamoru","lastName":"Nakanishi","id":"37286009600"},{"name":"Takeshi Ogura","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ogura","id":"37086720344"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-137-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-135-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-136-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981243","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981243","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image reconstruction","Hardware","Computer aided manufacturing","Automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","image sampling","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple directional sampling windows","cellular hardware platform","nondirectional sampling windows","multidirectional morphological wavelet transform","CAM2"]}],"abstract":"Morphological wavelet transform using multiple directional sampling windows is successfully implemented on a cellular hardware platform (CAM\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n).

Using the three dimensional (3D) technology is an essential and also attractive technique to solve these problems. However, the limitation on the number of through silicon vias (TSVs) is one of the most important challenges of 3D FPGAs. This paper proposes two modified topologies for the 3D switch boxes (SBs), named Universal-MTwist and Wilton-MTwist, which increase the efficient use of TSVs. The simulation results manifest that the two new SB topologies efficiently reduce the number of TSVs 60% and 66%, respectively. Additionally, the use of them reduces the horizontal channel width 7% and 6%, respectively, compared to the 3D Disjoint SB. Meanwhile, the delay remains almost the same.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981252.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"393","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area efficient switch box topologies for 3D FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Field programmable gate arrays","Three dimensional displays","Switches","Delay","Wires","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D FPGA","area efficient switch box topologies","dense routing channels","global interconnects","field programmable gate arrays","ASIC","three dimensional technology","through silicon vias","TSV","3D switch boxes","Universal-MTwist","Wilton-MTwist"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Area efficient switch box topologies for 3D FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981252/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173845","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area efficient switch box topologies for 3D FPGAs","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"b4pc209222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084051S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981257,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The LNA consumes less than 85\u03bcW. The integrated offset compensation circuit makes the system less sensitive to mismatch and variations in the culture medium biasing voltage. A sample& hold (S&H) buffer stores the amplified input signals locally, thereby realising an electronic shutter function. This allows for simultaneous acquisition of all pixels. The on-chip logic permits individual selection of every single pixel at any time. As a result, regions of interest (ROIs) of any size can be defined. Accordingly, the entire cell culture or subregions can be observed at a high sampling rate. Moreover, each pixel is equipped with a stimulation circuitry. Centered around a programmable SRAM cell, it offers the creation of complex stimulation patterns on the MEA.

Currently, such embedded systems comprise a processor and memory. To recognize many images, many template images must be stored in memory and must be sent quickly from memory to the processor. For example, assuming that the system receives an external image with 1 million pixels at every 1 ms and assuming that the system must execute template-matching operations of 1 million template images with the same million pixels within 1 ms, then the transfer speed from the memory to the processor and the processor operation reaches 1 Petapixel/s. Therefore, to realize high-speed template-matching operation, a dynamically reconfigurable vision-chip architecture with a holographic memory and large-bandwidth optical connections has been proposed. Among such researches, this paper presents a proposal of novel parallel template-matching operations performed on the dynamically reconfigurable vision-chip architecture. Furthermore, the advantages of the new method are discussed based on some demonstration results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981291.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel template matching operations on a dynamically reconfigurable vision-chip architecture","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","holographic displays","image matching","reconfigurable architectures","robots","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel template matching operation","dynamic reconfigurable vision-chip architecture","high-speed image recognition","autonomous vehicles","robots","embedded system","processor","large-bandwidth optical connection","holographic memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parallel template matching operations on a dynamically reconfigurable vision-chip architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12179708","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel template matching operations on a dynamically reconfigurable vision-chip architecture","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"a4pc259267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084659S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981293,"authors":[{"name":"Emily G.

Future CS signal processing systems will exploit significant time- and/or frequency-domain sparsity to achieve ultra-low-power bio-signal acquisition in the analog, digital, or mixed-signal domains. A measurement matrix of random values is key to one form of CS computation. It has been shown for ECG and EMG signals that signal-to-quantization noise ratios (SQNR) >; 60 dB with compression factors up to 16X are achievable using uniform or Gaussian 6-bit random coefficients. In this paper, 1-bit random coefficients are shown also to give compression factors up to 16X with similar SQNR performance. This approach reduces hardware and saves energy concomitant with 1-bit versus 6-bit signal processing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing of ECG bio-signals using one-bit measurement matrices","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981293","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981293.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing of ECG bio-signals using one-bit measurement matrices","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981293/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173863","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing of ECG bio-signals using one-bit measurement matrices","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"a4pc279305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04529S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981295,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien Tuffery","affiliation":["IMS laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Tuffery","id":"37946175100"},{"name":"Nathalie Deltimple","affiliation":["IMS laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Deltimple","id":"37277053700"},{"name":"Bernardo Leite","affiliation":["IMS laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Bernardo","lastName":"Leite","id":"37395626500"},{"name":"Philippe Cathelin","affiliation":["ST-Ericsson, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Cathelin","id":"37403070500"},{"name":"Vincent Knopik","affiliation":["ST-Ericsson, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Knopik","id":"37285038600"},{"name":"Eric Kerherv\u00e9","affiliation":["IMS laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Kerherv\u00e9","id":"37277058800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-137-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-135-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-136-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981295","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1047},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Topology","Switching circuits","Transistors","Batteries","Radio frequency","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cells (electric)","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","Long Term Evolution","power supplies to apparatus","power transistors","transformers","UHF power amplifiers","UHF transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear reconfigurable CMOS power amplifier","3GPP LTE applications","reconfigurable power amplifier","envelope tracking","power transistor switching techniques","battery depletion","stand-alone power amplifier","power back-off","distributed active transformer","parallelized power cells","power added efficiency","frequency 2.535 GHz","size 65 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981295","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981295.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 27.5-dBm linear reconfigurable CMOS power amplifier for 3GPP LTE applications","abstract":"In this paper, a reconfigurable power amplifier (PA) fully integrated in 65-nm CMOS technology, combining Envelope Tracking (ET) and Power Transistor Switching (PTS) techniques, and robust to battery depletion is presented.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has a very high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), making it very sensitive to non linearities. We have chosen the Active Constellation Extension (ACE) to reduce the crest factor, which is not sufficient. In this paper, we show that the association of ACE with digital predistortion helps to improve the Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) and so permits a good linearity improvement. The association is first validated in simulation. In measurements, for 42.5dBm RMS output power, which represents the nominal power, the ACPR is increased from 32dBc to 49dBc. For a given ACPR of 35dBc, the RMS output power is increased from 40.7dBm to 42.7dBm.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981313","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 9th International New Circuits and systems conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5964389/5980824/05981313.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2011.5981313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5980824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearity improvement thanks to the association of Active Constellation Extension and digital predistortion for OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981313/","displayDocTitle":"Linearity improvement thanks to the association of Active Constellation Extension and digital predistortion for OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12179728","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981313/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearity improvement thanks to the association of Active Constellation Extension and digital predistortion for OFDM","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"b3la19071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034995S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5981314,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Chinnici","affiliation":["PDU Microwave Radio, Ericsson Telecomunicazioni S.p.A., Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Chinnici","id":"37684811600"},{"name":"Carmelo Decanis","affiliation":["PDU Microwave Radio, Ericsson Telecomunicazioni S.p.A., Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Carmelo","lastName":"Decanis","id":"37330318200"},{"name":"Andrea Quadrini","affiliation":["PDU Microwave Radio, Ericsson Telecomunicazioni S.p.A., Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Quadrini","id":"37372117800"},{"name":"Dan Weinholt","affiliation":["PDU Microwave Radio, Ericsson AB, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Weinholt","id":"37946144700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-137-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-135-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-136-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981314","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Application specific integrated circuits","Parity check codes","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Receivers","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit testing","microwave integrated circuits","parity check codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","Reed-Solomon codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high order M-QAM transceiver","gigabit radio microwave transmission channel","FPGA test chipset","ASIC design","LDPC error correction code","Reed-Solomon","oscillators"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the system and architecture design of a transceiver for transmission of data rates up to 1 Gb/s over the microwave radio channel.

The use of standard digital tester channel for the acquisition of modulated analog/RF signals is investigated in order to implement low-cost functional test. The idea is to use the comparator available in a standard digital test resource to record level-crossing events on a signal coming from the device under test, and then to apply a dedicated algorithm to retrieve the signal information. The proposed method is evaluated through both simulation and hardware experiments using the popular QAM coding scheme that combines both amplitude and phase shift-keying. The approach is generic and can be applied to a broad range of modulation schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981317/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12179732","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981317/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Level-crossing based QAM demodulation for low-cost analog/RF testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Level-crossing based QAM demodulation for low-cost analog/RF testing","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"b3la59133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050014S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5964389","isNumber":"5980824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5964389","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5980824","articleId":"5981317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981374,"authors":[{"name":"Ruisi He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruisi","lastName":"He","id":"37709056400"},{"name":"Zhangdui Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhangdui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37287974400"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai","id":"37270328400"},{"name":"Jianwen Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Ding","id":"37537858700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5981374","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1429},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Rail transportation","Antenna measurements","Antennas","Predictive models","Velocity measurement","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","radiowave propagation","railway communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["empirical path loss model","fading analysis","high-speed railway viaduct scenario","narrowband measurement","Zhengzhou-Xi'an high-speed railway in China","base station antenna","propagation","fading depth","Ricean K -factor","frequency 930 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fading depth","high-speed railway","path loss exponent","path loss model","viaduct"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981374","abstract":"Based on the narrowband 930-MHz measurements taken along the \u201cZhengzhou-Xi'an\u201d high-speed railway in China, an empirical path loss model is proposed.

The antenna resembles the bunny-ear or balanced antipodal Vivaldi antenna (BAVA) designs, but most importantly uses metallic shorting posts between the fins and the ground plane that suppress a mid-band catastrophic common-mode resonance that occurs in 2D arrays of balanced radiators fed with unbalanced feeds.

As a result, they are useful to analyze the geometric information that often dominate multidimensional data much more efficiently than traditional wavelets. The shearlet system, for example, is a particular well-known realization of this framework, which provides optimally sparse representations of images with edges. In this paper, we further investigate the constructions derived from this approach to develop critically sampled wavelets with composite dilations for the purpose of image coding. Not only do we show that many nonredundant directional constructions recently introduced in the literature can be derived within this setting, but we also introduce new critically sampled discrete transforms that achieve much better nonlinear approximation rates than traditional discrete wavelet transforms and outperform the other critically sampled multiscale transforms recently proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2164415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2164415","startPage":"550","endPage":"561","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6129825/05981390.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critically Sampled Wavelets With Composite Dilations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Critically Sampled Wavelets With Composite Dilations","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981390/","accessionNumber":"12472206","pubMedId":"21843993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981390/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critically Sampled Wavelets With Composite Dilations","sourcePdf":"tip-easley-2164415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100407S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"5981390","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5981391,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Feng Cai","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6129825/5981391/5981391-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian-Feng Cai received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computational mathematics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong.","He was a Research Scientist with the National University of Singapore, Singapore, from 2007 to 2009 and a CAM Assistant Adjunct Professor with the University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, from 2009 to 2011.

In this paper, we focus on how to recover a motion-blurred image due to camera shake. A regularization-based approach is proposed to remove motion blurring from the image by regularizing the sparsity of both the original image and the motion-blur kernel under tight wavelet frame systems. Furthermore, an adapted version of the split Bregman method is proposed to efficiently solve the resulting minimization problem. The experiments on both synthesized images and real images show that our algorithm can effectively remove complex motion blurring from natural images without requiring any prior information of the motion-blur kernel.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6129825/05981391.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2164413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2164413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Framelet-Based Blind Motion Deblurring From a Single Image","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Deconvolution","Minimization","Cameras","Wavelet transforms","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["framelet-based blind motion deblurring","single image","digital imaging","tight wavelet frame systems","motion-blur kernel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind deconvolution","motion blur","split Bregman method","tight frame"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Framelet-Based Blind Motion Deblurring From a Single Image","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5981391/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12472207","pubMedId":"21843995","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Framelet-Based Blind Motion Deblurring From a Single Image","sourcePdf":"tip-ji-2164413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124467S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"5981391","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5981395,"authors":[{"name":"Shijian Lu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology & Research), Singapore"],"firstName":"Shijian","lastName":"Lu","id":"37405953500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"5981395","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1857},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Retinal vessels","Lesions","Pathology","Image analysis","Computer aided diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","diseases","edge detection","eye","image segmentation","medical image processing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optic disc detection","optic disc segmentation","circular transformation","computer aided diagnosis","optic disc boundary image variation","image pixel","evenly oriented radial line segments","optic disc center","STARE dataset","ARIA dataset","MESSIDOR dataset","pathological retinas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular transformation","ocular image analysis","optic disc detection","optic disc segmentation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Databases, Factual","Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Optic Disk","Optic Disk"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981395","abstract":"Under the framework of computer-aided diagnosis, this paper presents an accurate and efficient optic disc (OD) detection and segmentation technique.

Most of the proposed approaches thus far have relied on the use of series string of the dc-dc converter to create a high-voltage string connected to the dc-ac inverter. The boost converter is better in this application. However, under inhomogeneous irradiation, the power generated by each PV module and the output dc voltage of each boost become unbalanced so that the output currents of each boost are balanced and equal to the string current. In this case, the boost converter cannot always deliver all the power from a mixture of shaded panels and those delivering full power. In this paper, a nondissipative string current diverter is proposed to overcome this problem. One important feature of the proposed circuit herein is the ability to effectively decouple each converter from the rest of the string, making it insensitive to change in the string current. Hence, it is possible to obtain the maximum power from the PV module with the maximum power point tracking algorithm implemented on each dc-dc converter and to do so at the optimum efficiency. The simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed topology exhibits notable performances despite inhomogeneous irradiation. On the other hand, the string current diverter circuit is very easy to control and does not operate without inhomogeneous irradiation, so the topology efficiency is improved for any type of irradiation.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/05981398.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nondissipative String Current Diverter for Solving the Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter Connection Problem in Photovoltaic Power Generation System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981398/","displayDocTitle":"Nondissipative String Current Diverter for Solving the Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter Connection Problem in Photovoltaic Power Generation System","volume":"27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524206","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981398/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nondissipative String Current Diverter for Solving the Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter Connection Problem in Photovoltaic Power Generation System","sourcePdf":"tpel-gaubert-2164268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083495S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"5981398","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5981400,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Up Jang","affiliation":["Institute for Information Technology Convergence, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Up","lastName":"Jang","id":"37674381900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5981400","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":664},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Sensors","Strontium","Cognitive radio","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","secondary-to-primary interference","hybrid cognitive radio","primary transmitter","primary receiver","traffic","interference level","spectrum sensing","detection probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","interference level limitation","power control","sensing"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence considers a hybrid cognitive radio (H-CR) where the primary transmitter (PT) transmits message to the primary receiver (PR) whenever traffic occurs by allowing interference level \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">I</i>\n from the secondary transmitter (ST) to the PR, and the ST transmits messages to the secondary receiver (SR) by controlling the transmitting power based on spectrum sensing and interference level \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">I</i>\n.

In this paper, we study the practical application of such an iterative detection and decoding (IDD) framework to underwater acoustic communications. We explore complexity and performance tradeoffs of a variety of turbo equalization (TEQ)-based receiver architectures. First, we elaborate on two popular but suboptimal turbo equalization techniques: a channel-estimate-based minimum mean-square error TEQ (CE-based MMSE-TEQ) and a direct-adaptive TEQ (DA-TEQ). We study the behavior of both TEQ approaches in the presence of channel estimation errors and adaptive filter adjustment errors. We confirm that after a sufficient number of iterations, the performance gap between these two TEQ algorithms becomes small. Next, we demonstrate that an underwater receiver architecture built upon the least mean squares (LMS) DA-TEQ technique can leverage and dramatically improve the performance of the conventional implementation based on the decision-feedback equalizer at a feasible complexity. To maintain performance gains over time-varying channels, the slow convergence speed of the LMS algorithm has been improved via two methods: 1) repeating the weight update for the same set of data with decreasing step size and 2) reducing the dimensionality of the equalizer by capturing sparse channel structure. This receiver architecture was used to process collected data from the SPACE 08 experiment (Martha's Vineyard, MA). Receiver performance for different modulation orders, channel codes, and hydrophone configurations is examined at a variety of distance, up to 1 km from the transmitters. Experimental results show great promise for this approach, as data rates in excess of 15 kb/s could readily be achieved without error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Linear Turbo Equalization Over Doubly Selective Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2011.2158013","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6042360/05981405.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2158013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6042360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981405/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Linear Turbo Equalization Over Doubly Selective Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12301635","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Linear Turbo Equalization Over Doubly Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"joe-choi-2158013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047214S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6042360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"66","articleId":"5981405","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5981406,"authors":[{"name":"Serge Karabchevsky","affiliation":["Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of The Negev, Beersheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/6042360/5981406/5981406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Serge Karabchevsky received the B.Sc. degree in computer and electronic engineering from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in 2005, where he is currently working towards the M.Sc. degree in electro-optical engineering.","His research interests are computational vision and image processing and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) logic."]},"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Karabchevsky","id":"37601431000"},{"name":"David Kahana","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/6042360/5981406/5981406-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["David Kahana received the B.Sc. degree in computer and electronic engineering from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in 2005.","During this research, he studied with the Laboratory of Autonomous Robotics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University.

The SONAR images are perturbed by a multiplicative noise called speckle, due to the coherent nature of the scattering phenomenon. Speckle reduction filters are necessary to optimize the images' exploitation procedures. The results of speckle filters may vary from one sensor and one wavelength to another; therefore, no generic de-speckling algorithm exists. Several studies have been carried out on speckle noise suppression on sidescan sonar, but the problem of speckle noise suppression for FLS has not yet been covered. A comparison of the most used classical speckle suppression filters as well as advanced wavelet-based ones was carried out. The Frost filter was found to be the most adequate for FLS data, but also the most computationally complex and not suitable for real-time processing. Two novel architectures for real-time and low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of the Frost speckle filter for underwater imaging sonar are presented. The proposed architectures have superior performance and power efficiency compared to standard software implementation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Sonar","Wavelet transforms","Adaptive filters","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","field programmable gate arrays","sonar imaging","speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based adaptive speckle suppression filter","underwater imaging sonar","forward-looking imaging sonar","FLS","scattering phenomenon","multiplicative noise","speckle","Frost filter","field-programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","speckle","sonar"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981406","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2011.2157729","startPage":"646","endPage":"657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6042360/05981406.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6042360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2157729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981406/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Adaptive Speckle Suppression Filter for Underwater Imaging Sonar","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"36","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12301636","htmlLink":"/document/5981406/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Adaptive Speckle Suppression Filter for Underwater Imaging Sonar","sourcePdf":"joe-karabchevsky-2157729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120306S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6042360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6042360","articleId":"5981406","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5981407,"authors":[{"name":"Craig A.

There is a great deal more to remote sensing data than meets the eye, and extracting that information turns out to be a major computational challenge. For this purpose, high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure such as clusters, distributed networks or specialized hardware devices provide important architectural developments to accelerate the computations related with information extraction in remote sensing. In this paper, we review recent advances in HPC applied to remote sensing problems; in particular, the HPC-based paradigms included in this review comprise multiprocessor systems, large-scale and heterogeneous networks of computers, grid and cloud computing environments, and hardware systems such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Combined, these parts deliver a snapshot of the state-of-the-art and most recent developments in those areas, and offer a thoughtful perspective of the potential and emerging challenges of applying HPC paradigms to remote sensing problems.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2162643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/5997340/05981407.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2162643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5997340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent Developments in High Performance Computing for Remote Sensing: A Review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981407/","displayDocTitle":"Recent Developments in High Performance Computing for Remote Sensing: A Review","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206715","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981407/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent Developments in High Performance Computing for Remote Sensing: A Review","sourcePdf":"jstars-plaza-2162643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121984S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"5997340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"5997340","articleId":"5981407","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5981408,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Plaza","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, C\u00e1ceres, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/5997340/5981408/5981408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Plaza (M'05\u2013SM'07) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.","He was a Visiting Researcher with the Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, with the Applied Information Sciences Branch, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, and with the AVIRIS Data Facility, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.

For a class of realistic actuator power and efficiency functions, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based algorithm was devised to find all the local optimal solutions, and consequently the global minimum through a further simple comparison among all the realistic local minima and boundary values for such a non-convex optimization problem. This KKT-based algorithm is also independent on the selections of initial conditions by transferring the standard nonlinear optimization problem into classical eigenvalue problems. Numerical examples for electric vehicles with in-wheel motors were utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed global optimization algorithm. Simulation results, based on the parameters of an electric ground vehicle actuated by in-wheel motors (whose energy efficiencies were experimentally calibrated), showed that the proposed global optimization algorithm was at least 20 times faster than the classical active-set optimization method, while achieving better control allocation results for system energy saving.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2161989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2161989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6228555","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6228555/05981409.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Optimization","Resource management","Power demand","Mathematical model","Brushless DC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","electric vehicles","energy conservation","nonlinear programming","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global optimal energy-efficient control allocation","over-actuated electric ground vehicles","operational energy efficiency","actuator power","efficiency function","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker based algorithm","global minimum","local minima","boundary value","nonconvex optimization problem","nonlinear optimization problem","classical eigenvalue problem","in-wheel motor","global optimization algorithm","active-set optimization method","system energy saving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrical ground vehicles (EGVs)","energy-efficient control allocation (EECA)","global optimality","in-wheel motors","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions","over-actuated systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Global Optimal Energy-Efficient Control Allocation With Applications to Over-Actuated Electric Ground Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981409/","volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5981409/","accessionNumber":"12820754","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Global Optimal Energy-Efficient Control Allocation With Applications to Over-Actuated Electric Ground Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tcst-wang-2161989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155591S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6228555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6228555","articleId":"5981409","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5981410,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The performance of the proposed protocol in terms of data-collection delay and throughput under impulsive noise interference is analyzed and compared with that of the neighbor relay polling (NRP) protocol. The proposed protocol does not require a central controller to initiate all data transmission unlike polling-based protocols and can be applied to PLC systems with unstructured networks. The proposed protocol ensures significantly lower data-collection delay than the NRP protocol.

After calibration, measurement errors for 15 chips fabricated in digital CMOS 0.13 \u03bcm fall within -4.0~4.0 \u00b0C in a temperature range of 0~100 \u00b0C, where the temperature chamber used has a control uncertainty of \u00b11.1 \u00b0C.

This scenario is of particular significance for wireless applications with high quality of service requirements. The bit error probability (BEP) performances of three basic diversity combining schemes in Nakagami-0.5 fading are considered. It is shown that the error rate performances of dual branch equal gain and selection combining (SC) diversity are identical regardless of modulation format. It is also shown that L-branch maximal ratio combining diversity in Nakagami-0.5 fading has the same BEP performance as single branch reception in Nakagami-L/2 fading with L times the transmission power of each branch. A useful upper bound for the BEP of L-branch SC diversity in Nakagami-0.5 fading is also derived. The performance degradation for the worst case Nakagami-0.5 fading relative to Rayleigh fading can be as much as 24.6 dB for a dual-diversity receiver at target BEP of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n. The additional resources required to restore a specified performance level, as increased channel signal-to-noise ratio and as number of additional diversity branches, are quantified. It is concluded that worst case Nakagami channels can result in dramatically poorer performance than Rayleigh channels, making proper system design and evaluation essential to achieve a required transmission quality.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.080111.100373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.080111.100373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","startPage":"2742","endPage":"2752","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/05981416.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Diversity methods","Signal to noise ratio","Nakagami distribution","Modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear diversity combining","Nakagami-0.5 fading channels","Nakagami-0.5 distribution","Nakagami distribution","bit error probability performance","selection combining diversity","modulation format","branch reception","transmission power","Rayleigh fading channel","channel signal-to-noise ratio","transmission quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity combining","fading channels","Nakagami-m fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Linear Diversity Combining on Nakagami-0.5 Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317750","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981416/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981416/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Diversity Combining on Nakagami-0.5 Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"2742-tc1110-beaulieu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060002S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"5981416","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5981428,"authors":[{"name":"Nouha Alyaoui","affiliation":["Electronic Laboratories of Technology's Information (L.E.T.I), National Engineering School of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nouha","lastName":"Alyaoui","id":"37658355300"},{"name":"Helmi Ben Hnia","affiliation":["Electronic Laboratories of Technology's Information (L.E.T.I), National Engineering School of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Helmi Ben","lastName":"Hnia","id":"37658357100"},{"name":"Abdennaceur Kachouri","affiliation":["ISSG Higher Institute of Industrial Systems, Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdennaceur","lastName":"Kachouri","id":"37390104600"},{"name":"Mounir Samet","affiliation":["Electronic Laboratories of Technology's Information (L.E.T.I), National Engineering School of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Samet","id":"37400471400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0411-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0413-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0412-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981428","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Frequency modulation","Object recognition","Mobile computing","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","signal classification","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-induced cyclostationarity approach","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM signals classification","cognitive radio","IEEE 802.11","WiFi identification","wireless fidelity system identification","multi-carrier transmission","pilot induced cyclostationarity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","WiFi system identification","Pilot-Induced Cyclostationarity","Probability of Correct Classification"]}],"abstract":"This paper reviews an approach for the automatic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)signals classification for the cognitive radio applied to the standard IEEE 802.11 (the WiFi: Wireless Fidelity system) identification.

The problem is to reconstruct the object plane distribution for both the phase and the amplitude from complex-valued observations at the sensor plane.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Imaging","Phase modulation","Minimization","Amplitude modulation","Diffraction","Optical diffraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image representation","inverse problems","light diffraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse numerical imaging","transform-domain sparse modeling","image formation","wave field reconstruction problem","forward wave field propagation","parallel image plane","parallel sensor plane","Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral","arbitrary phase","arbitrary amplitude","matrix representation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WIO.2011.5981464","publicationTitle":"2011 10th Euro-American Workshop on Information Optics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th Euro-American Workshop on Information Optics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967844/5981432/05981464.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIO.2011.5981464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond the diffraction limits: Inverse numerical imaging based on transform-domain sparse modeling for phase and amplitude","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beyond the diffraction limits: Inverse numerical imaging based on transform-domain sparse modeling for phase and amplitude","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981464/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981464/","accessionNumber":"12206076","conferenceDate":"19-24 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond the diffraction limits: Inverse numerical imaging based on transform-domain sparse modeling for phase and amplitude","confLoc":"Benicassim, Spain","sourcePdf":"P11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043895S","chronDate":"19-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967844","isNumber":"5981432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967844","xplore-issue":"5981432","articleId":"5981464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981482,"authors":[{"name":"Idris.

In this work, we use the MDE approach to model the physical synthesis process with a focus mainly on reconfigurable architectures. We present a model for island style FPGAs along with the transformations needed in the case of the physical synthesis.

In such architectures, multi-core processors come with high computation rates while the reconfigurable logic offers high performance per watt and adaptability to the application constraints. However, the design of heterogeneous architectures is facing extremely challenging requirements such as the appropriate programming model, design tools, and the rapid system prototyping. Focusing this issue, we present a prototyping environment for heterogeneous CPU/FPGA systems. Within this environment, we conceived a generic and scalable architecture based on a multi-core processor tightly-connected to FPGA in order to meet performance, power and flexibility goals. Furthermore, front-end interfaces are presented in order to establish communication, data sharing, and synchronisation between the different software and hardware processing units. Finally, we defined a design methodology that eases the development of applications onto heterogeneous systems. Our environment is conceived using standard host machine coupled with a Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA through the PCI Express standard bus. In the experimental part, we evaluate first the reliability of different CPU/FPGA communication solutions in order to bring real-time capabilities to our system. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficiency of the presented design methodology for heterogeneous systems through the FIR signal processing application.","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967008/5981488/05981497.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A prototyping environment for high performance reconfigurable computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Multicore processing","Software","Central Processing Unit","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","peer-to-peer computing","peripheral interfaces","reconfigurable architectures","shared memory systems","software prototyping","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prototyping environment","high performance reconfigurable computing","hardware architectures","heterogeneous CPU-FPGA systems","multicore processors","reconfigurable logic","front-end interfaces","data sharing","synchronisation","software-hardware processing units","host machine","Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA","PCI Express standard bus","FIR signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A prototyping environment for high performance reconfigurable computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981497/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173995","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A prototyping environment for high performance reconfigurable computing","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"2A02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064086S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967008","isNumber":"5981488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967008","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5981488","articleId":"5981497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981500,"authors":[{"name":"Lubos Gaspar","affiliation":["Laboratoire Hubert Curien, UMR 5516, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Lubos","lastName":"Gaspar","id":"37893373400"},{"name":"Viktor Fischer","affiliation":["Laboratoire Hubert Curien, UMR 5516, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37325929300"},{"name":"Lilian Bossuet","affiliation":["Laboratoire Hubert Curien, UMR 5516, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Lilian","lastName":"Bossuet","id":"37281910400"},{"name":"Robert Fouquet","affiliation":["Laboratoire Hubert Curien, UMR 5516, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Fouquet","id":"37945706200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0640-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0641-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981500","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Registers","Encryption","Protocols","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA soft core processors","symmetric key cryptography","general-purpose processors","cryptographic accelerator","crypto-coprocessor","key storage zones","cipher zone","Altera NIOS II","Xilinx MicroBlaze","Actel Cortex M1 soft core processor extensions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware security","Crypto-processor","FPGA softcore","NIOS II","MicroBlaze","Cortex M1"]}],"abstract":"When used in cryptographic applications, general-purpose processors are often completed by a cryptographic accelerator - crypto-coprocessor. Secret keys are usually stored in the internal registers of the processor, and are vulnerable to attacks on protocols, software/firmware or cache memory. The paper presents three ways of extending soft general purpose processors for cryptographic applications. The proposed extension is aimed at symmetric key cryptography and it guarantees secure key management. Three security zones are created and physically separated in each of three configurations: processor, cipher and key storage zones. In the three zones, the secret keys are manipulated in a different manner - in clear or enciphered, as common data or keys. The security zones are separated on the protocol, system, architectural and physical levels. The proposed principle is validated on Altera NIOS II, Xilinx MicroBlaze and Actel Cortex M1 soft core processor extensions. The NIOS II processor needs fewer clock cycles per data block encryption, because the security module is included in the processor's data path. The data path of the MicroBlaze is unchanged and thus shorter, but additional clock cycles are necessary for data transfers between the processor and the security module. The Cortex M1 processor is connected via AHB bus and the cryptographic extension is accessed as an ordinary peripheral - a coprocessor. Although the interfacing is different, the three processors with their extensions attain the required high security level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure extensions of FPGA soft core processors for symmetric key cryptography","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981500","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981488","publicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967008/5981488/05981500.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Secure extensions of FPGA soft core processors for symmetric key cryptography","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981500/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173996","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure extensions of FPGA soft core processors for symmetric key cryptography","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"2B02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053211S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967008","isNumber":"5981488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967008","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5981488","articleId":"5981500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5981501,"authors":[{"name":"An Braeken","affiliation":["Department IWT, Erasmushogeschool Brussel, Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Braeken","id":"37545943900"},{"name":"Jan Genoe","affiliation":["Katholieke Hogeschool Limburg, Diepenbeek, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Genoe","id":"37268141800"},{"name":"Serge Kubera","affiliation":["Department IWT, Erasmushogeschool Brussel, Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Kubera","id":"37545942900"},{"name":"Nele Mentens","affiliation":["Katholieke Hogeschool Limburg, Diepenbeek, Belgium","ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nele","lastName":"Mentens","id":"37272474100"},{"name":"Abdellah Touhafi","affiliation":["Department IWT, Erasmushogeschool Brussel, Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Abdellah","lastName":"Touhafi","id":"38262104700"},{"name":"Ingrid Verbauwhede","affiliation":["ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Verbauwhede","id":"37274332200"},{"name":"Yannick Verbelen","affiliation":["Department IWT, Erasmushogeschool Brussel, Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Verbelen","id":"37946603700"},{"name":"Jo Vliegen","affiliation":["Katholieke Hogeschool Limburg, Diepenbeek, Belgium","ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jo","lastName":"Vliegen","id":"37540417700"},{"name":"Karel Wouters","affiliation":["ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Wouters","id":"37689218600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0640-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0641-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981501","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Cryptography","Field programmable gate arrays","IP networks","Authentication","Embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure remote reconfiguration","FPGA-based embedded system","field programmable gate array","data confidentiality","key authentication","data origin authentication","TCP-IP connection","cryptographic part","communication part"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the protocol, architecture, and implementation details of an FPGA-based embedded system that is able to remotely reconfigure the FPGA, using a TCP/IP connection, in a secure way.

The system can be easily integrated at any point in the design of an FPGA-based embedded system, due to the simple and modular architecture.","publicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967008/5981488/05981501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure remote reconfiguration of an FPGA-based embedded system","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Secure remote reconfiguration of an FPGA-based embedded system","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981501/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure remote reconfiguration of an FPGA-based embedded system","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"2B03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053932S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967008","isNumber":"5981488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967008","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5981488","articleId":"5981501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981505,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This forces the designers and engineers, who are using the partial reconfiguration capability of FPGAs, to use expensive families such as Virtex-4, Virtex-5 and Virtex-6 which are officially supported by partial reconfiguration (PR) software. Moreover, Xilinx still does not offer a portable, dedicated self-reconfiguration engine for all of the FPGAs. Self-reconfiguration is achieved with general-purpose processors such as MicroBlaze and PowerPC which are too overqualified for this purpose. In this study, we propose a new self-reconfiguration mechanism for Spartan-6 FPGAs. This mechanism can be used to implement large and complex designs on small FPGAs as chip area can be dramatically reduced by exploiting the dynamic partial reconfiguration feature for on-demand functionality loading and maximal utilization of the hardware. This approach is highly attractive for designing low-cost compute-intensive applications such as high performance image processing systems. For Spartan-6 FPGAs, we have developed hard-macros and exploited the self-reconfiguration engine, compressed Parallel Configuration Access Port (cPCAP) [1], that we designed for Spartan-3. The modified cPCAP core with block RAM controller, bitstream decompressor unit and Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) Finite State Machine (FSM) occupies only about 82 of 6,822 slices (1.2% of whole device) on a Spartan-XC6SLX45 FPGA and it achieves the maximum theoretical reconfiguration speed of 200MB/s (ICAP, 16-bit at 100MHz) proposed by Xilinx. We have also implemented a Reconfigurable Processing Element (RPE) whose arithmetic unit can be reconfigured on-the-fly. Multiple RPEs can be utilized to design a General Purpose Image Processing System (GPIPS) that can implement a number of different algorithms during runtime. As an illustrative example, we programmed the GPIPS on Spartan-6 for switching between two applications on-demand such as two-dimensional filtering and block-matching.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-reconfigurable platform for general purpose image processing systems on low-cost spartan-6 FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981513","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981488","publicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967008/5981488/05981513.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A self-reconfigurable platform for general purpose image processing systems on low-cost spartan-6 FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981513/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12179778","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-reconfigurable platform for general purpose image processing systems on low-cost spartan-6 FPGAs","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"4B03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073785S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967008","isNumber":"5981488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967008","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5981488","articleId":"5981513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981517,"authors":[{"name":"Luciano Ost","affiliation":["L.I.R.M.M, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Ost","id":"38259883900"},{"name":"Gabriel Marchesan Almeida","affiliation":["L.I.R.M.M, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Gabriel Marchesan","lastName":"Almeida","id":"37541274200"},{"name":"Marcelo Mandelli","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Mandelli","id":"37706975500"},{"name":"Eduardo Wachter","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Wachter","id":"37950146500"},{"name":"Sameer Varyani","affiliation":["L.I.R.M.M, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Varyani","id":"37706947300"},{"name":"Gilles Sassatelli","affiliation":["L.I.R.M.M, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Sassatelli","id":"37298938600"},{"name":"Leandro Soares Indrusiak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Leandro Soares","lastName":"Indrusiak","id":"37265045500"},{"name":"Michel Robert","affiliation":["L.I.R.M.M, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Robert","id":"37290164300"},{"name":"Fernando Moraes","affiliation":["FACIN, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Moraes","id":"37265068600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0642-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0640-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0641-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5981517","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981517","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Heuristic algorithms","Energy consumption","Unified modeling language","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous NoC-based MPSoC","high-level modeling","FPGA","energy consumption","ADPCM","MPEG","multimedia benchmarks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modeling","NoC-based MPSoCs","design space exploration of heterogeneous MPSoCs","dynamic mapping"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel strategy for enabling dynamic task mapping on heterogeneous NoC-based MPSoC architectures.

The stepper motors are very good in positioning tasks and measurement tasks. Now there are some FPGA based developments for stepper motor controlling systems because of the complexity of the controlling system.

Especially for domains like space applications robust redundany methodologies are needed to make use of these new architectures. In this paper we study fine grain redundancy methodologies which can be used to construct high robust designs. Our basic approach is to localize the fault tolerance structure to a fine grain view. We then show two methodologies which are suitable for FPGAs. The methodologies are similar to Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) which is a widely used approach for mitigating upsets and failures. However for new device generations simply replicating complete systems in TMR manner may not be sufficient anymore especially in harsh environments, such as space applications. We integrate both approaches into standard FPGA tool flows thereby introducing redundancy automatically without user interaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12179794","htmlLink":"/document/5981537/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study on fine granular fault tolerance methodologies for FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on fine granular fault tolerance methodologies for FPGAs","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"P51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107602S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967008","isNumber":"5981488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967008","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5981488","articleId":"5981537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5981538,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For such a rescue robot each motion is a potential vital sign but the existing techniques for motion detection have severe limitations in dealing with strong levels of ego-motion on walking robots. This paper proposes an optical flow based method for the detection of moving objects using a single camera mounted on a hexapod robot for an application in a rescue scenario. The proposed algorithm estimates and compensates ego-motion to allow for object detection while the robot is moving. Our algorithm can deal with strong rotation and translation in 3D, using a first-order-flow motion model, with four degrees of freedom. Two alternative object detection methods using a 2D-histogram based vector clustering and motion compensated frame differencing respectively are examined for the detection of slow and fast moving objects. In addition to a software implementation, the system was implemented on an FPGA, enabling processing in real-time at 31 fps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based real-time moving object detection for walking robots","doi":"10.1109/SSRR.2010.5981554","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSRR.2010.5981554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981546","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Safety Security and Rescue Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Safety Security and Rescue Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971365/5981546/05981554.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based real-time moving object detection for walking robots","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981554/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"12189528","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based real-time moving object detection for walking robots","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"SSRR2010paper07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088592S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5971365","isNumber":"5981546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5971365","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5981546","articleId":"5981554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5981672,"authors":[{"name":"Di Huang","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Lyon, LIRIS UMR 5205,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Ecully, France"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401456900"},{"name":"Wael Ben Soltana","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Lyon, LIRIS UMR 5205,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Ecully, France"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Ben Soltana","id":"37945901100"},{"name":"Mohsen Ardabilian","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Lyon, LIRIS UMR 5205,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Ecully, France"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Ardabilian","id":"37298852700"},{"name":"Yunhong Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281428400"},{"name":"Liming Chen","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Lyon, LIRIS UMR 5205,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Ecully, France"],"firstName":"Liming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292793900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0529-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0528-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"}],"articleNumber":"5981672","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel biological vision-based facial description, namely Perceived Facial Images (PFIs), aiming to highlight intra-class and inter-class variations of both facial range and texture images for textured 3D face recognition. These generated PFIs simulate the response of complex neurons to gradient information within a certain neighborhood and possess the properties of being highly distinctive and robust to affine illumination and geometric transformation. Based on such an intermediate facial representation, SIFT-based matching is further carried out to calculate similarity scores between a given probe face and the gallery ones. Because the facial description generates a PFI for each quantized gradient orientation of range and texture faces, we then propose a score level fusion strategy which optimizes the weights using a genetic algorithm in a learning step. Evaluated on the entire FRGC v2.0 database, the rank-one recognition rate using only 3D or 2D modality is 95.5% and 95.9%, respectively; while fusing both modalities, i.e. range and texture-based PFIs, the final accuracy is 98.0%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed biological vision-based facial description and the optimized weighted sum fusion.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981672.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Textured 3D face recognition using biological vision-based facial representation and optimized weighted sum fusion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Three dimensional displays","Face recognition","Neurons","Lighting","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","face recognition","genetic algorithms","image fusion","image matching","image texture","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["textured 3D face recognition","biological vision-based facial representation","optimized weighted sum fusion","perceived facial images","image texture","affine illumination","geometric transformation","SIFT-based matching","genetic algorithm","score level fusion strategy","FRGC v2.0 database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Textured 3D face recognition using biological vision-based facial representation and optimized weighted sum fusion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981672/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173867","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Textured 3D face recognition using biological vision-based facial representation and optimized weighted sum fusion","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0001BIOM.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080474S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5981701,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Wei Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Hung-Wei","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37067924400"},{"name":"Laura Grupp","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Grupp","id":"37397928600"},{"name":"Steven Swanson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Swanson","id":"37407859800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981701","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":23,"totalDownloads":396},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Bit error rate","Programming","Encoding","Reliability","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer power supplies","data integrity","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power loss","flash memory","computer systems","music players","mission-critical server systems","data integrity","power failure","interrupted program operations","flash-based solid-state drives"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flash memory","power failure","power loss"]}],"abstract":"Flash memory is quickly becoming a common component in computer systems ranging from music players to mission-critical server systems. As flash plays a more important role, data integrity in flash memories becomes a critical question. This paper examines one aspect of that data integrity by measuring the types of errors that occur when power fails during a flash memory operation. Our findings demonstrate that power failure can lead to several non-intuitive behaviors. We find that increasing the time before power failure does not always reduce error rates and that a power failure during a program operation can corrupt data that a previous, successful program operation wrote to the device. Our data also show that interrupted program operations leave data more susceptible to read disturb and increase the probability that the programmed data will decay over time. Finally, we show that incomplete erase operations make future program operations to the same block unreliable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the impact of power loss on flash memory","publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981701.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the impact of power loss on flash memory","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981701/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180096","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the impact of power loss on flash memory","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056849S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981703,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunsun Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunsun","lastName":"Park","id":"37960670900"},{"name":"Sungjoo Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungjoo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37085210700"},{"name":"Sunggu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunggu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293414300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981703","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change random access memory","Memory management","Energy consumption","Hybrid power systems","Radiation detectors","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer power supplies","concurrency theory","DRAM chips","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power management","hybrid DRAM-based main memory","hybrid PRAM-based main memory","nonvolatile memory","phase-change RAM","DRAM refresh energy reduction","runtime-adaptive method","total memory energy","DRAM decay","DRAM bypass","dirty data keeping","DRAM refreshes reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","phase-change RAM","refresh","power"]}],"abstract":"Hybrid main memory consisting of DRAM and non-volatile memory is attractive since the non-volatile memory can give the advantage of low standby power while DRAM provides high performance and better active power.

In order to reduce DRAM refresh energy which occupies a significant portion of total memory energy, we present a runtime-adaptive method of DRAM decay. In addition, we present two methods, DRAM bypass and dirty data keeping, for further reduction in refresh energy and memory access latency, respectively.

Many methods have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, unsupervised approaches have been widely accepted for clustering motion patterns, due to the fact that no previous knowledge of the scene is required. The fuzzy self-organizing map (fuzzy SOM) is an unsupervised method which has been previously used for classifying motion patterns. However, it suffers from high computational cost when a large number of output neurons is required, especially with complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for dealing with the number of output neurons of fuzzy SOM in a complex scene. The performance of our approach shows better results compared with the normal approach, and without any major effect on the computational cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981730.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An extended fuzzy SOM for anomalous behaviour detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Neurons","Hidden Markov models","Humans","Tracking","Databases","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences","fuzzy set theory","image classification","image motion analysis","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended fuzzy SOM","self-organizing map","anomalous behaviour detection","motion pattern analysis","unsupervised method","motion pattern classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An extended fuzzy SOM for anomalous behaviour detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981730/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173906","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An extended fuzzy SOM for anomalous behaviour detection","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0006CVCG.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064813S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5981735,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjia Yuan","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjia","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37956871200"},{"name":"Kristin Dana","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, USA"],"firstName":"Kristin","lastName":"Dana","id":"37265950300"},{"name":"Michael Varga","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Varga","id":"37969407700"},{"name":"Ashwin Ashok","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Ashok","id":"37426698400"},{"name":"Marco Gruteser","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Gruteser","id":"37298565800"},{"name":"Narayan Mandayam","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Mandayam","id":"37279451600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0529-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0528-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"}],"articleNumber":"5981735","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":733},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","MIMO","Visualization","Image segmentation","Monitoring","Measurement","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computer vision","image sensors","LED displays","MIMO communication","optical communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision methods","visual MIMO optical system","light emitting displays","electronic billboards","computer monitors","hand-held devices","camera-based optical wireless communication systems","multiple antenna radio frequency communications channel","multiple transmitter radio frequency communications channel","visual MIMO channel","electronic display detection","transmission signal","electronic display appearance"]}],"abstract":"Cameras have become commonplace in phones, laptops, music-players and handheld games.

It consumes 28% of the available on-chip resources, runs with a maximum frequency of 114.20 MHz, has a detection rate of 99.1% and capable of processing one image (640\u00d7480) in 3.8ms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173914","htmlLink":"/document/5981739/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-time license plate localisation on FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time license plate localisation on FPGA","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0007ECVW.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049583S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981754,"authors":[{"name":"Changdao Dong","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Changdao","lastName":"Dong","id":"37955092000"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981754","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":354},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981754","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Monte Carlo methods","Random variables","Algorithm design and analysis","Gaussian distribution","Optimization","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","probability","SRAM chips","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM failure rate prediction","Gibbs sampling method","SRAM statistical analysis","SRAM cells","optimal probability distribution","statistics community","transistor-level simulations","integrated optimization engine","1D random sampling","starting point selection","SRAM cell","SRAM design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated Circuit","Process Variation","Memory"]}],"abstract":"Statistical analysis of SRAM has emerged as a challenging issue because the failure rate of SRAM cells is extremely small. In this paper, we develop an efficient importance sampling algorithm to capture the rare failure event of SRAM cells. In particular, we adapt the Gibbs sampling technique from the statistics community to find the optimal probability distribution for importance sampling with minimum computational cost (i.e., a small number of transistor-level simulations). The proposed Gibbs sampling method applies an integrated optimization engine to adaptively explore the failure region by sampling a sequence of one-dimensional probability distributions. Several implementation issues such as one-dimensional random sampling and starting point selection are carefully studied to make the Gibbs sampling method efficient and accurate for SRAM failure rate prediction. Our experimental results of a commercial 65nm SRAM cell demonstrate that the proposed Gibbs sampling method achieves 3-10\u00d7 runtime speed-up over other state-of-the-art techniques without surrendering any accuracy.","publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981754.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient SRAM failure rate prediction via Gibbs sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient SRAM failure rate prediction via Gibbs sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981754/","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981754/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180106","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient SRAM failure rate prediction via Gibbs sampling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067345S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981763,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Aadithya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Aadithya","id":"37945934700"},{"name":"Sriramkumar Venogopalan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sriramkumar","lastName":"Venogopalan","id":"37945935400"},{"name":"Alper Demir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ko\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Alper","lastName":"Demir","id":"37356760600"},{"name":"Jaijeet Roychowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaijeet","lastName":"Roychowdhury","id":"37266458300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981763","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MUSTARD: A coupled, stochastic/deterministic, discrete/continuous technique for predicting the impact of Random Telegraph Noise on SRAMs and DRAMs","abstract":"With aggressive technology scaling and heightened variability, SRAMs and DRAMs have become vulnerable to Random Telegraph Noise (RTN).

Biologically-inspired computer vision systems seek to capture key aspects of the computational architecture of the brain, and such approaches have proven successful across a range of standard object and face recognition tasks (e.g. [23, 8, 9, 18]). Here, we explore the effectiveness of these algorithms on a large-scale unconstrained real-world face recognition problem based on images taken from the Face-book social networking website. In particular, we use a family of biologically-inspired models derived from a high-throughput feature search paradigm [19, 15] to tackle a face identification task with up to one hundred individuals (a number that approaches the reasonable size of real-world social networks). We show that these models yield high levels of face-identification performance even when large numbers of individuals are considered; this performance increases steadily as more examples are used, and the models outperform a state-of-the-art commercial face recognition system. Finally, we discuss current limitations and future opportunities associated with datasets such as these, and we argue that careful creation of large sets is an important future direction.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981788","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","startPage":"35","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling up biologically-inspired computer vision: A case study in unconstrained face recognition on facebook","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scaling up biologically-inspired computer vision: A case study in unconstrained face recognition on facebook","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981788/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173940","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981788/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling up biologically-inspired computer vision: A case study in unconstrained face recognition on facebook","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0011WBCV.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055176S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5981799,"authors":[{"name":"Vikas Reddy","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, QLD, Australia","NICTA, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37391610200"},{"name":"Conrad Sanderson","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, QLD, Australia","NICTA, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Conrad","lastName":"Sanderson","id":"37269421000"},{"name":"Brian C.

Initial foreground segmentation of the input frames confines the analysis to foreground objects and effectively ignores irrelevant background dynamics. Input frames are split into non-overlapping cells, followed by extracting features based on motion, size and texture from each cell. Each feature type is independently analysed for the presence of an anomaly. Unlike most methods, a refined estimate of object motion is achieved by computing the optical flow of only the foreground pixels. The motion and size features are modelled by an approximated version of kernel density estimation, which is computationally efficient even for large training datasets. Texture features are modelled by an adaptively grown code-book, with the number of entries in the codebook selected in an online fashion. Experiments on the recently published UCSD Anomaly Detection dataset show that the proposed method obtains considerably better results than three recent approaches: MPPCA, social force, and mixture of dynamic textures (MDT). The proposed method is also several orders of magnitude faster than MDT, the next best performing method.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981799","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981799.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved anomaly detection in crowded scenes via cell-based analysis of foreground speed, size and texture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981799/","displayDocTitle":"Improved anomaly detection in crowded scenes via cell-based analysis of foreground speed, size and texture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173950","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981799/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved anomaly detection in crowded scenes via cell-based analysis of foreground speed, size and texture","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0015MLvMA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07097S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5981807,"authors":[{"name":"Csaba Beleznai","affiliation":["Video-and Security Technology, Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Csaba","lastName":"Beleznai","id":"37267354700"},{"name":"David Schreiber","affiliation":["Video-and Security Technology, Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Schreiber","id":"38268884400"},{"name":"Michael Rauter","affiliation":["Video-and Security Technology, Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rauter","id":"38264666700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0529-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0528-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"}],"articleNumber":"5981807","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"abstract":"Achieving accurate pedestrian detection for practically relevant scenarios in real-time is an important problem for many applications, while representing a major scientific challenge at the same time. In this paper we present an algorithmic framework which efficiently computes pedestrian-specific shape and motion cues and combines them in a probabilistic manner to infer the location and occlusion status of pedestrians viewed by a stationary camera. The articulated pedestrian shape is represented by a set of sparse contour templates, where fast template matching against image features is carried out using integral images built along oriented scan-lines. The motion cue is obtained by employing a non-parametric background model using the YCbCr color space. Both cues are computed and evaluated on the GPU. Given the probabilistic output from the two cues the spatial configuration of hypothesized human body locations is obtained by an iterative optimization scheme taking into account the depth ordering and occlusion status of individual hypotheses. The method achieves fast computation times even in complex scenarios with a high pedestrian density. Employed computational schemes are described in detail and the validity of the approach is demonstrated on three PETS2009 datasets depicting increasing pedestrian density.

These methods imitate the detection process that human use. They use features based on gradients, such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG), or extract interest points in the image, such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), etc. In this paper, we present a novel human detection method using depth information taken by the Kinect for Xbox 360. We propose a model based approach, which detects humans using a 2-D head contour model and a 3-D head surface model. We propose a segmentation scheme to segment the human from his/her surroundings and extract the whole contours of the figure based on our detection point. We also explore the tracking algorithm based on our detection result. The methods are tested on our database taken by the Kinect in our lab and present superior results.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981811","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human detection using depth information by Kinect","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Human detection using depth information by Kinect","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981811/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173961","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981811/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human detection using depth information by Kinect","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0020HAU3D.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07161S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981814,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Connaughton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Connaughton","id":"37681582400"},{"name":"Amanda Sgroi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Amanda","lastName":"Sgroi","id":"37947159800"},{"name":"Kevin W.

Event-driven sensors are biologically-inspired and autonomously reacting to scene dynamics and generating events upon relative light intensity change. Their wide dynamic range and high temporal resolution properties enable efficient activity monitoring in natural environment. Using a stereo pair of event-driven sensor chip, it is possible to represent the scene dynamics in a 3D volume at high temporal resolution. Therefore, the person's activity in a home environment can be efficiently recorded, with a low data volume and high temporal resolution that allows efficient incident detection, like person's falls. In this paper, a dataset with scenarios including 68 person's falls has been analyzed for real-time detection with event-driven stereo vision systems and the results are promising.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981819","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981819.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven stereo vision for fall detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981819/","displayDocTitle":"Event-driven stereo vision for fall detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173966","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981819/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-driven stereo vision for fall detection","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0023ECVW.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047634S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5981826,"authors":[{"name":"Sungho Park","affiliation":["Microsystems Design Laboratory (MDL), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Park","id":"37965767000"},{"name":"Srinidhi Kestur","affiliation":["Microsystems Design Laboratory (MDL), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Srinidhi","lastName":"Kestur","id":"37545433500"},{"name":"Kevin M.

While recent advances in technology have increased the capacity of FPGAs, lack of standard models for developing custom accelerators creates issues with scalability and compatibility. In this paper, we describe a model for designing streaming hardware accelerators with run-time configurability. This model provides a generic interface for each hardware module, a modular and hierarchical structure for parallelism at multiple levels and a run-time reconfiguration framework for increased flexibility. We present case studies to accelerate sample neu-romorphic vision algorithms which are inspired by models of the mammalian visual cortex. Experimental results show speedups of several factors over comparable CPU implementations and higher performance-per-watt over relevant GPU implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invited paper: Accelerating neuromorphic vision on FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981826","startPage":"103","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981826.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Invited paper: Accelerating neuromorphic vision on FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981826/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173973","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invited paper: Accelerating neuromorphic vision on FPGAs","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0027ECVW.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056352S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5981827,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Cheng","affiliation":["Center of Unified Biometrics and Sensors, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37956485600"},{"name":"Sergey Tulyakov","affiliation":["Center of Unified Biometrics and Sensors, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Tulyakov","id":"37396816500"},{"name":"Venu Govindaraju","affiliation":["Center of Unified Biometrics and Sensors, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Venu","lastName":"Govindaraju","id":"37276543300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0529-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0528-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"}],"articleNumber":"5981827","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Sensor systems","Databases","Biosensors","Feature extraction","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","fingerprint identification","image fusion","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple sample fusion","biometric systems","score matching","enrolled template","combination algorithm enhancement","likelihood ratio combination methods","linear ratio combination methods","FVC2002 fingerprint databases"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981827","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981827.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-sample fusion of matching scores in biometric systems","abstract":"If a biometric matching attempt does not succeed, the person might be asked to repeat authentication attempt second time.

Several transformations are illustrated using connected components analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invited paper: Adapting algorithms for hardware implementation","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981828","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981828.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Invited paper: Adapting algorithms for hardware implementation","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981828/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12173975","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invited paper: Adapting algorithms for hardware implementation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0028ECVW.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060805S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981829,"authors":[{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Farabet","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA","Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9ment","lastName":"Farabet","id":"37392217400"},{"name":"Berin Martini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Berin","lastName":"Martini","id":"37547537500"},{"name":"Benoit Corda","affiliation":["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Corda","id":"37947323400"},{"name":"Polina Akselrod","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Polina","lastName":"Akselrod","id":"37543218100"},{"name":"Eugenio Culurciello","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Eugenio","lastName":"Culurciello","id":"37268496400"},{"name":"Yann LeCun","affiliation":["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"LeCun","id":"37282875900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0529-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0528-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2160-7508"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"}],"articleNumber":"5981829","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":218,"citationCountPatent":55,"totalDownloads":3390},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981829","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Computer architecture","Runtime","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Convolvers","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","flow graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NeuFlow","runtime reconfigurable dataflow processor","scalable dataflow hardware architecture","dataflow compiler","luaFlow","flow graph representations","machine code","Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA platform","laptop computer"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a scalable dataflow hardware architecture optimized for the computation of general-purpose vision algorithms - neuFlow - and a dataflow compiler - luaFlow - that transforms high-level flow-graph representations of these algorithms into machine code for neuFlow.

In this paper, we propose a low-energy, biomedical computation platform optimized through the use of an accelerator for data-driven classification. The accelerator retains selective flexibility through hardware reconfiguration and exploits voltage scaling and parallelism to operate at a sub-threshold minimum-energy point.

The significant silicon areas occupied by TSVs bring critical challenges for 3D IC placement. Unlike most published 3D placement works that only minimize the number of TSVs during placement due to the limitations in their techniques, this paper proposes a new 3D cell placement algorithm which can additionally consider the sizes of TSVs and the physical positions for TSV insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of three stages: (1) 3D analytical global placement with density optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs, (2) TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization, and (3) layer-by-layer detailed placement. In particular, the global placement is based on a novel weighted-average wirelength model, giving the first model in the literature that can outperform the well-known log-sum-exp wirelength model theoretically and empirically. Further, 3D routing can easily be accomplished by traditional 2D routers since the physical positions of TSVs are determined during placement. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D cell placement works, our algorithm can achieve the best routed wirelength, TSV counts, and total silicon area, in shortest running time.","publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981862.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","startPage":"664","endPage":"669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TSV-aware analytical placement for 3D IC designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TSV-aware analytical placement for 3D IC designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981862/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180137","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981862/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TSV-aware analytical placement for 3D IC designs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073908S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981863,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cong","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Cong","id":"37276009100"},{"name":"Guojie Luo","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Guojie","lastName":"Luo","id":"37287861200"},{"name":"Yiyu Shi","affiliation":["ECE Department, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Yiyu","lastName":"Shi","id":"37595375200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981863","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":621},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Through-silicon vias","Thermal conductivity","Temperature distribution","Power distribution","Heating","Thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit design","silicon","thermal management (packaging)","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["through-silicon-via co-placement","3D IC","TSV","thermal-aware 3D placement methods","heat conductivity","lumped power consumption","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal awareness","TSV distribution","3D placement"]}],"abstract":"Existing thermal-aware 3D placement methods assume that the temperature of 3D ICs can be optimized by properly distributing the power dissipations, and ignoring the heat conductivity of though-silicon-vias (TSVs). However, our study indicates that this is not exactly correct. While considering the thermal effect of TSVs during placement appears to be quite complicated, we are able to prove that when the TSV area in each bin is proportional to the lumped power consumption in that bin, together with the bins in all the tiers directly above it, the peak temperature is minimized. Based on this criterion, we implement a thermal-aware 3D placement tool. Compared to the methods that prefer a uniform power distribution that only results in an 8% peak temperature reduction, our method reduces the peak temperature by 34% on average with even slightly less wirelength overhead. These results suggest that considering thermal effects of TSVs is necessary and effective during the placement stage. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first thermal-aware 3D placement tool that directly takes into consideration the thermal and area impact of TSVs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-aware cell and through-silicon-via co-placement for 3D ICs","publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981863.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-aware cell and through-silicon-via co-placement for 3D ICs","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981863/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189509","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-aware cell and through-silicon-via co-placement for 3D ICs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065435S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981868,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401324800"},{"name":"Hong-Yan Su","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hong-Yan","lastName":"Su","id":"37965624500"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981868","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981868","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Power demand","Pins","Algorithm design and analysis","Merging","Complexity theory","Optical detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","bioMEMS","electronic design automation","electronics packaging","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","minimisation","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["progressive network-flow based power-aware broadcast addressing","pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips","PDMFB","packaging","product cost","single control pin","multiple electrodes","mutually-compatible control signals","merging control signals","redundant actuation","product lifetime","system reliability","pin-count reduction","power-consumption minimization","design automation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital microfluidics","electrode addressing","power"]}],"publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981868.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive network-flow based power-aware broadcast addressing for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips","abstract":"In recent emerging marketplace, designs for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips (PDMFBs) have received much attention due to the large impact on packaging and product cost. One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually-compatible control signals. Prior works utilize this addressing scheme by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging. However, merging control signals also introduces redundant actuations, which potentially cause a high power-consumption problem. Recent studies on PDMFBs have indicated that high power consumption not only decreases the product lifetime but also degrades the system reliability. Unfortunately, this power-aware design concern is still not readily available among current design automations of PDMFBs. To cope with these issues, we propose in this paper the first power-aware broadcast addressing for PDMFBs. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and power-consumption minimization into consideration, thereby achieving higher integration and better design performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981868/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12189510","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Progressive network-flow based power-aware broadcast addressing for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive network-flow based power-aware broadcast addressing for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066742S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981869,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"38559881400"},{"name":"Bo-Ru Ke","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bo-Ru","lastName":"Ke","id":"37949063600"},{"name":"Jian-Nan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jian-Nan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37965416300"},{"name":"Chih-Tsun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Tsun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281272400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981869","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":366},"abstract":"This paper presents the systematic methodology of error correction scheme using low-density parity check (LDPC) codes to improve the reliability and endurance of multi-level cell (MLC) non-volatile memories.

Additionally, inaccuracies in face localisation can also introduce scale and alignment variations. Using all face images, including images of poor quality, can actually degrade face recognition performance. While one solution it to use only the `best' of images, current face selection techniques are incapable of simultaneously handling all of the abovementioned issues. We propose an efficient patch-based face image quality assessment algorithm which quantifies the similarity of a face image to a probabilistic face model, representing an `ideal' face. Image characteristics that affect recognition are taken into account, including variations in geometric alignment (shift, rotation and scale), sharpness, head pose and cast shadows. Experiments on FERET and PIE datasets show that the proposed algorithm is able to identify images which are simultaneously the most frontal, aligned, sharp and well illuminated. Further experiments on a new video surveillance dataset (termed ChokePoint) show that the proposed method provides better face subsets than existing face selection techniques, leading to significant improvements in recognition accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patch-based probabilistic image quality assessment for face selection and improved video-based face recognition","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981881","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS","pdfPath":"/iel5/5966640/5981671/05981881.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Patch-based probabilistic image quality assessment for face selection and improved video-based face recognition","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981881/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12179763","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patch-based probabilistic image quality assessment for face selection and improved video-based face recognition","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0018BIOM.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088383S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5966640","isNumber":"5981671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5966640","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"5981671","articleId":"5981881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5981886,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Aisopos","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Aisopos","id":"37644308000"},{"name":"Chia-Hsin Owen Chen","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin Owen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539294500"},{"name":"Li-Shiuan Peh","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Li-Shiuan","lastName":"Peh","id":"37274794400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981886","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Timing","Integrated circuit modeling","Runtime","Data models","Analytical models","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit reliability","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level modeling","variation-induced faults","networks-on-chips reliability","process variation","circuit-level fault-modeling tool","system-level NoC simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault modeling","variation","Networks-on-Chips"]}],"abstract":"Process Variation (PV) is increasingly threatening the reliability of Networks-on-Chips.

With 3% extra area added to the baseline L2 cache, BiC eliminates the need to build 215KB dedicated SRAM for the accelerators, while increasing total cache misses by no more than 0.3%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Software","Substrates","Speech recognition","Indexes","Hardware","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","multiprocessing systems","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer-integrated-cache","SRAM architecture","handheld platforms","embedded platforms","MPSoC","Pentium\u2112 cores","augmented reality accelerator","speech recognition accelerator","L2 cache"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cache","Memory","System-on-Chip","Accelerator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981889","startPage":"966","endPage":"971","publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981889.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981889/","displayDocTitle":"Buffer-Integrated-Cache: A cost-effective SRAM architecture for handheld and embedded platforms","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12180154","htmlLink":"/document/5981889/","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer-Integrated-Cache: A cost-effective SRAM architecture for handheld and embedded platforms","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083123S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5981959,"authors":[{"name":"Baoxian Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Baoxian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37655196000"},{"name":"Hakan Aydin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Aydin","id":"37268075900"},{"name":"Dakai Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dakai","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37288487800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981959","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Transient analysis","Real time systems","Optimized production technology","Reliability engineering","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware computing","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized reliability-oriented energy management","real-time embedded applications","DVFS technique","energy management technique","generalized shared recovery technique","GSHR","task-level processing frequencies","energy consumption minimization","reliability-aware power management frameworks","close-to-optimal energy savings","dynamic voltage-and-frequency scaling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-Time Embedded Systems","Energy Management","DVFS"]}],"abstract":"DVFS remains an important energy management technique for embedded systems.

Using search space reduction/truncation strategies in MIMO detection along with H.264 data partitioning (DP) method, we determine the decoding configurations that yield minimum energy consumption for pre-specified image qualities at the receiver. The synthesis result of this scalable MIMO detector using a 45nm technology library yields 52%, 57%, and 58% energy reductions at 24dB SNR in Foreman, Akiyo, and Mobile test streams respectively. The tradeoff is negligible 0.3dB degradation in peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) typically used in an image quality estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation

In this paper, we present an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for accelerating gridding using FPGAs. We present a parameterized hardware library for accelerating gridding to support both arbitrary and regular trajectories. We further describe our kernel automation framework which supports several kernel functions through look-up-table (LUT) based Taylor polynomial evaluation. This framework is integrated using an in-house multi-FPGA development platform which provides hardware infrastructure for integrating custom accelerators. Design-space exploration is enabled by an automation flow which allows system generation from an algorithm specification. We further provide several case studies by realizing systems for nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NuFFT) with different parameter sets and porting them on to the BEE3 platform.

Hardware and software systems that are thus designed may be viewed as \u201cscalable effort systems\u201d, since they offer the capability to modulate the effort that they expend towards computation, thereby allowing for tradeoffs between output quality and efficiency. We propose the concept of Dynamic Effort Scaling (DES), which refers to dynamic management of the control knobs that are exposed by scalable effort systems. We argue the need for DES by observing that the degree of resilience often varies significantly across applications, across datasets, and even within a dataset. We propose a general conceptual framework for DES by formulating it as a feedback control problem, wherein the scaling mechanisms are regulated with the goal of maintaining output quality within a certain specified limit. We present an implementation of Dynamic Effort Scaling in the context of a scalable-effort processor for Support Vector Machines, and evaluate it under various application scenarios and data sets. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach - statically setting the scaling mechanisms leads to either significant error overshoot or significant opportunities for energy savings left on the table unexploited. In contrast, DES is able to effectively regulate the output quality while maximally exploiting the time-varying resiliency in the workload.","publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981982.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic effort scaling: Managing the quality-efficiency tradeoff","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981982/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic effort scaling: Managing the quality-efficiency tradeoff","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180220","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981982/","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic effort scaling: Managing the quality-efficiency tradeoff","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068753S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5981987,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Shi","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Shi","id":"37895754500"},{"name":"Ankur Srivastava","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37278954800"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37634820400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981987","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"abstract":"Micro-channel cooling shows great potential in removing high density heat in 3D circuits. The current micro-channel heat sink designs spread the entire surface to be cooled with micro-channels. This approach, though might provide sufficient cooling, requires quite high pumping power. In this paper, we investigate the non-uniform allocation of micro-channels to provide sufficient cooling with less pumping power. Specifically, we decide the count, location and pumping pressure drop/flow rate of micro-channels such that acceptable cooling is achieved at minimum pumping power. Thermal wake effect and runtime pressure drop/flow rate control are also considered. The experiments showed that, compared with the conventional design which spreads micro-channels all over the chip, our non-uniform micro-channel design achieves 55-60% pumping power saving.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cooling","Three dimensional displays","Heating","Thermal resistance","Resource management","Runtime","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","heat sinks","microchannel flow","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform microchannel heat sink design","stacked 3D-IC","microchannel cooling","thermal wake effect","runtime pressure drop","flow rate control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-IC","micro-channel","liquid cooling","power"]}],"publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981987.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-uniform micro-channel design for stacked 3D-ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-uniform micro-channel design for stacked 3D-ICs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981987/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5981987/","accessionNumber":"12189521","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-uniform micro-channel design for stacked 3D-ICs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072033S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5981988,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Sun","affiliation":["ECE Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37954594700"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872800"},{"name":"Ming-Yuan Ting","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ming-Yuan","lastName":"Ting","id":"37545263200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981988","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":173},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5981988","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power grids","Matching pursuit algorithms","Mathematical model","Equations","Algorithm design and analysis","Matrix decomposition","Fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","iterative methods","power integrated circuits","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental analysis","on-chip power grid","sparse approximation","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","numerical stability","algebraic multi-grid method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated Circuit","Power Grid","Incremental Analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new sparse approximation technique is proposed for incremental power grid analysis. Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that when a power grid network is locally updated during circuit design, its response changes locally and, hence, the incremental \u201cchange\u201d of the power grid voltage is almost zero at many internal nodes, resulting in a unique sparse pattern. An efficient Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed sparse approximation problem. In addition, several numerical techniques are proposed to improve the numerical stability of the proposed solver, while simultaneously maintaining its high efficiency. Several industrial circuit examples demonstrate that when applied to incremental power grid analysis, our proposed approach achieves up to 130\u00d7 runtime speed-up over the traditional Algebraic Multi-Grid (AMG) method, without surrendering any accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5981698","publicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968673/5981698/05981988.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient incremental analysis of on-chip power grid via sparse approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient incremental analysis of on-chip power grid via sparse approximation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5981988/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180225","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5981988/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient incremental analysis of on-chip power grid via sparse approximation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105851S","chronDate":"5-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968673","isNumber":"5981698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968673","xplore-issue":"5981698","articleId":"5981988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5981994,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Saripalli","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Saripalli","id":"37400224000"},{"name":"Asit Mishra","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Asit","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37595168200"},{"name":"Suman Datta","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Datta","id":"37273578800"},{"name":"Vijaykrishnan Narayanan","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijaykrishnan","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"37273383200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0636-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"85-644924"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100x"},{"format":"CD","value":"0738-100x"}],"articleNumber":"5981994","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":577},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Logic gates","Delay","FETs","Program processors","Integrated circuit modeling","Tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect transistors","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","tunnel transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid TFET-CMOS chip multiprocessor","inter-band tunneling FET","CMOS cores"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tunnel FETs","Heterogeneous Multi-Core"]}],"abstract":"The steep sub-threshold characteristics of inter-band tunneling FETs (TFETs) make an attractive choice for low voltage operations.

It incorporates efficient memory access and data prefetching techniques for jointly reducing the on/off-chip memory energy consumption. A dynamically expanding search window is constructed at run time to reduce the off-chip memory accesses. Considering the multi-stage processing nature of advanced fast ME/DE schemes, a reduced-sized multi-bank on-chip memory is employed which can be power-gated depending upon the video properties. As a result, when tested for various video sequence, our approach provides a dynamic energy reduction of 82-96% for the off-chip memory and a leakage energy reduction of 57-75% for the on-chip memory compared to the Level-C and Level-C+ prefetching techniques (which are the prominent data reuse and prefetching techniques in ME for video coding).

This paper proposes an automatic intensity-based registration algorithm that relies on the optimization of a new similarity measure (SM), within a multiresolution block matching framework. Indeed, several SMs have been evaluated and ranked on real sidescan sonar data to determine the most relevant intensity dependencies between images for matching purposes. Correlation ratio (CR) and mutual information (MI) are then selected and because of their complementary behaviors, merged in a new SM (MI&CR), which performs better than CR or MI alone, to determine robust matching blocks between images. Thus, the proposed two-step registration algorithm uses MI&CR to match two sonar images: a single rigid translation globally matches the images, then a field of locally applied translations is computed for adjusting the final registration to remaining local distortions. Actual processing time can then be tuned according to the required registration accuracy. Due to a survey standard operating mode, only same-survey overlapping images are considered as candidates for matching. Moreover, building mosaics from registered images assumes a flat sea bottom as no global elevation information is provided by sidescan sonar images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intensity-Based Block Matching Algorithm for Mosaicing Sonar Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2011.2141850","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6042360/05982090.pdf","startPage":"627","endPage":"645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2141850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6042360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Intensity-Based Block Matching Algorithm for Mosaicing Sonar Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5982090/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12301638","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intensity-Based Block Matching Algorithm for Mosaicing Sonar Images","sourcePdf":"joe-gueriot-2141850-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116807S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6042360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6042360","articleId":"5982090","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5982096,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Fa Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fa","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292925500"},{"name":"Yo-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yo-Sheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279531700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5982096","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":593},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Noise measurement","CMOS integrated circuits","Noise","Mercury (metals)","Frequency measurement","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","distributed amplifiers","field effect MMIC","inductors","interference suppression","invertors","microwave amplifiers","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple noise suppression","two-stage distributed amplifier","cascade gain cell","two enhanced CMOS inverters","gain-peaking inductors","RL terminal network","power dissipation","frequency 1.2 GHz to 8.6 GHz","size 0.18 mum","power 9.85 mW","power 46.85 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","distributed amplifier (DA)","high gain","low noise","low power","noise suppression technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982096","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2011.2163059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2011.2163059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/6008161/05982096.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Performance Distributed Amplifier Using Multiple Noise Suppression Techniques","abstract":"We demonstrate a 1.2-8.6 GHz two-stage distributed amplifier (DA) with cascade gain cell, which constitutes two enhanced CMOS inverters, using standard 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology.

The receiver system targets at low complexity and low power under the premise of good performance. At algorithm level, dual-threshold (DT) detection method is proposed for robust detection performance in timing synchronization; multipartite table method (MTM) is employed to implement arctangent and sin/cos functions in coarse frequency synchronization. MTM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in power and area. A highly simplified phase tracking method is proposed with better performance in fine frequency synchronization. At architecture level, we focus on optimizing matched filter of packet detector, carrier frequency offset (CFO) corrector and FFT output reorder buffer. The proposed downlink baseband receiver is implemented with 0.13 /mi CMOS technology.

This approach is based on the use of the ripple amplitude of the feedback control voltage as an index for predicting subharmonic oscillations in these systems. First, the work revisits the stability analysis technique based on the nonlinear discrete-time model, demonstrating that the ripple amplitude can be included within the expression of the Jacobian matrix of this model, hence giving a mathematical support to extend the ripple index to more complex topologies. A simple but representative buck converter under voltage-mode control is used to illustrate the approach. Using the ripple-based index, closed-form expressions of stability boundaries are derived. Unlike other available results obtained from existing methods, the stability boundary, in this work is expressed analytically in terms of both power stage and controller design parameters. Moreover, one can determine how these parameters are involved in the closed form expressions and, furthermore, how each parameter affects the stability of the system. The approach is validated by numerical simulations from the state equations and also experimentally within a wide range of the design parameter space.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ripple-Based Design-Oriented Approach for Predicting Fast-Scale Instability in DC\u2013DC Switching Power Supplies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2161396","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6125259/05982108.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2161396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Ripple-Based Design-Oriented Approach for Predicting Fast-Scale Instability in DC\u2013DC Switching Power Supplies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5982108/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12444122","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ripple-Based Design-Oriented Approach for Predicting Fast-Scale Instability in DC\u2013DC Switching Power Supplies","sourcePdf":"tcsi-rodriguez-2161396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079381S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6125259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6125259","articleId":"5982108","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5982109,"authors":[{"name":"Song Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6125259/5982109/5982109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Song Sun received the B.S. degree in computer science and engineering from the Beijing Information Technology Institute, China, in 1998, and the M.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2001.

While the use of reconfigurable computing technology in a high-performance computing environment has shown recent promise in accelerating a wide variety of scientific applications, existing SMVM architectures on FPGA hardware have been limited in that they require either numerous pipeline stalls during computation (due to zero padding) or excessive input preprocessing during run-time. For large-scale sparse matrix scenarios, both of these shortcomings can result in unacceptable performance overheads, limiting the overall value of using FPGAs in a high-performance computing environment. In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient FPGA-based SMVM architecture which can handle arbitrary matrix sparsity patterns without excessive preprocessing or zero padding and can be dynamically expanded based on the available I/O bandwidth. Our experimental results using a commercial FPGA-based acceleration system demonstrate that our reconfigurable SMVM engine is highly efficient, with benchmark-dependent speedups over an optimized software implementation that range from to in terms of computation time.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6125259/05982109.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2161389","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2161389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An I/O Bandwidth-Sensitive Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication Engine on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"An I/O Bandwidth-Sensitive Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication Engine on FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982109/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982109/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12444123","volume":"59","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An I/O Bandwidth-Sensitive Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication Engine on FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zambreno-2161389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115779S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6125259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6125259","articleId":"5982109","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5982111,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Nader","affiliation":["Center of RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden","Electrical Measurement Department (ELEC), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6077122/5982111/5982111-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Charles Nader (S'08) received the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Lebanese University (ULFG2), Mount Lebanon, Lebanon, in 2005, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering/telecommunication from the University of G\u00e4vle, G\u00e4vle, Sweden in 2006, the Licentiate of Engineering degree in telecommunication/signal processing from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2010, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at both the Royal Institute of Technology and Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.","In 2007, he was a Consultant for Multilane Inc., Mount Lebanon, Lebanon, where he was involved with microwave devices and signal integrity.

Two major challenges arise when undersampling wideband waveforms: overlapping of aliased spectral bins of the digitized waveform and ambiguity in spectral bins standing on multiples of the Nyquist frequency. Those challenges are more pronounced when using wideband modulated signals to excite nonlinear devices. The theory behind a correct undersampled measurement is based on the use of an irrational relation between the undersampling frequency and the spectral resolution of the waveform to measure. This is the key to a successful harmonic sampling used today in large-signal network analyzers when wideband modulated waveforms are to be measured. Inverting the problem, such theory is also the solution for reconstructing wideband undersampled waveforms based on a single measurement and with a relatively short record of measured data. It is a solution for RF sampling and cognative radios where the digital processing is moving toward the antenna of the receiver.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Harmonic analysis","Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal reconstruction","signal sampling","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic sampling","wideband undersampled waveform","digitizing technique","spectral bins","Nyquist frequency","nonlinear device","undersampling frequency","spectral resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aliasing","RF measurement systems","spectrum reconstruction","undersampling","wideband signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2161882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6077122/05982111.pdf","startPage":"2961","endPage":"2969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2161882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic Sampling and Reconstruction of Wideband Undersampled Waveforms: Breaking the Code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Sampling and Reconstruction of Wideband Undersampled Waveforms: Breaking the Code","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982111/","volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982111/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12357235","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Sampling and Reconstruction of Wideband Undersampled Waveforms: Breaking the Code","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nader-2161882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08138S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6077122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6077122","articleId":"5982111","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5982115,"authors":[{"name":"Marina Lavorato","affiliation":["Faculdade de Engenharia de Ilha Solteira, Departamento de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, UNESP-Universidade Estadual Paulista, Ilha Solteira, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Marina Lavorato (S'07) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil, in 2002 and 2004 respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.","Currently she is carrying out postdoctorate research at the Universidade Estadual Paulista, Ilha Solteira, Brazil.

This situation is of particular concern for mini-grids or isolated grids in which wind and/or solar power sources are the dominant or the sole power sources. In this paper, we utilize the photo-electro-thermal theory to develop a design methodology for LED lighting systems for weakly regulated voltage sources, with the objectives of minimizing the fluctuation of the human luminous perception and adopting reliable LED driver with long lifetime and robustness against extreme weather conditions. The proposed LED system, practically verified in a 10 kVA small power grid driven by an ac voltage source and a wind energy simulator, can be considered as a smart load with its load demand following the power generation. A typical swing of 40 V in the mains will cause only 15% actual light variation in a 132 W LED system when compared with 40% change in 150 W high-pressure-sodium lamp system. The design methodology enables future large-scale LED systems to be designed as a new generation of smart loads that can adapt to the voltage and power fluctuations arising from the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2159631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2159631","startPage":"548","endPage":"554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5993785/05982116.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Design Methodology for Smart LED Lighting Systems Powered By Weakly Regulated Renewable Power Grids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Design Methodology for Smart LED Lighting Systems Powered By Weakly Regulated Renewable Power Grids","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982116/","accessionNumber":"12190337","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982116/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design Methodology for Smart LED Lighting Systems Powered By Weakly Regulated Renewable Power Grids","sourcePdf":"tsg-hui-2159631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0874S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5993785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5993785","articleId":"5982116","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5982118,"authors":[{"name":"Arvid Hammar","affiliation":["Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Terahertz and MillimetreWave Laboratory, Chalmers, University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6047823/5982118/5982118-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arvid Hammar was born in Uddevalla, Sweden in 1986.

In order to achieve increased energy efficiency for households there is a need to adjust energy consumption based on the dynamic needs of the people living there, and the available energy and costs at a specific time. Involved energy devices, such as electricity, gas and water meters, need to have a certain amount of \u201csmartness\u201d however without a common way to integrate them we risk ending up with a multitude of heterogeneous smart devices that need to be manually controlled one by one via device-specific interfaces and protocols. We believe that using IPv6 on every device is an important step towards creating a controllable and interoperable energy infrastructure. When every device can publish data and be directly addressed globally, real time monitoring and control becomes possible and more sophisticated as other parties can easily interact with it over Internet and integrate its functionality. Additionally the user is in control over which data to share, with whom and for what purpose (e.g. with the energy providers for billing), as well as which policy should be used when conditions change. In this demo we show how a Smart Home with an IPv6-equipped electricity smart meter prototype can report meter readings to cloud hosted business services, which collect readings from a number of meters, and can detect deviations from expected usage. In case of unexpected power shortage or surplus, the price is accordingly adjusted and the smart meters are informed. In the case of a price increase, it is up to the user to either pay the higher price, or to reduce her consumption (automatically based on their predefined policy). Similarly for a price drop, the user can choose to execute energy-hungry tasks. By allowing a energy gateway to control not only electricity but also other devices in the household infrastructure such as heating, the energy management can be made more efficient.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven IPv6 communication for the smart grid infrastructure","doi":"10.1109/DCOSS.2011.5982144","endPage":"2","displayPublicationTitle":"2011

Networks (BSN) provide a way to gather continuous observations of human movements, which has a potential of improving medical care quality, and enabling continuous remote patient monitoring. Despite their potential, BSNs face serious werability constraints. Energy optimization is essential since werability is most affected by the battery size of the device. In this paper, we introduce a burst communication technique that takes advantage of data buffering to achieve lower energy-per-bit cost with a possibly higher packet size or more energy efficient communication scheme suited for higher data rates. Our energy model combines the knowledge of the signal processing required to complete a task with the deadline associated with that task to define the optimal burst transmission schedule. Based on the selected energy model, we formulate an optimization function that minimizes the overall energy cost of communication for a given signal processing task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in sway monitoring BSN applications with a short, medium, and long deadlines. We further demonstrate the relationship between the task deadline extension and the energy cost of the system. Our results show that the proposed approach can improve the cost of communication 85-95% compared to streaming data to the basestation as it becomes available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12180891","htmlLink":"/document/5982156/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A wireless communication selection approach to minimize energy-per-bit for wearable computing applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wireless communication selection approach to minimize energy-per-bit for wearable computing applications","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"08AWirelessCommunicationSelectionApproachtoMi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101194S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970758","isNumber":"5982133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970758","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5982133","articleId":"5982156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982158,"authors":[{"name":"David I Shuman","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David I","lastName":"Shuman","id":"37294825200"},{"name":"Pierre Vandergheynst","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Vandergheynst","id":"37285157700"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0513-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0512-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0511-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-2936"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-2944"}],"articleNumber":"5982158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":752},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","Polynomials","Laplace equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Signal processing","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","graph theory","polynomial approximation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chebyshev polynomial approximation","distributed signal processing","graph Fourier multipliers","linear operators","high-dimensional signals","sensor networks","distributed computation","distributed denoising"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chebyshev polynomial approximation","denoising","distributed optimization","regularization","signal processing on graphs","spectral graph theory","wireless sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"Unions of graph Fourier multipliers are an important class of linear operators for processing signals defined on graphs.

It is important that a receiver is able to verify that sensor data was generated by trusted nodes. It may also be necessary to encrypt sensor data in transit. Recently, WSNs and traditional IP networks are more tightly integrated using IPv6 and 6LoWPAN. Available IPv6 protocol stacks can use IPsec to secure data exchange. Thus, it is desirable to extend 6LoWPAN such that IPsec communication with IPv6 nodes is possible. It is beneficial to use IPsec because the existing end-points on the Internet do not need to be modified to communicate securely with the WSN. Moreover, using IPsec, true end-to-end security is implemented and the need for a trustworthy gateway is removed. In this paper we provide End-to-End (E2E) secure communication between IP enabled sensor networks and the traditional Internet. This is the first compressed lightweight design, implementation, and evaluation of 6LoWPAN extension for IPsec. Our extension supports both IPsec's Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP). Thus, communication endpoints are able to authenticate, encrypt and check the integrity of messages using standardized and established IPv6 mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/DCOSS.2011.5982177","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems and Workshops (DCOSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems and Workshops (DCOSS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970758/5982133/05982177.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCOSS.2011.5982177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982133","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Securing communication in 6LoWPAN with compressed IPsec","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Securing communication in 6LoWPAN with compressed IPsec","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982177/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180908","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982177/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Securing communication in 6LoWPAN with compressed IPsec","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"29SecuringCommunicationin6LoWPANwithCompresse.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059988S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970758","isNumber":"5982133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970758","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5982133","articleId":"5982177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982206,"authors":[{"name":"Artis Mednis","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Artis","lastName":"Mednis","id":"37945263500"},{"name":"Girts Strazdins","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Girts","lastName":"Strazdins","id":"37945263300"},{"name":"Reinholds Zviedris","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Reinholds","lastName":"Zviedris","id":"37945264500"},{"name":"Georgijs Kanonirs","affiliation":["Digital Signal Processing Laboratory, Latvian University, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Georgijs","lastName":"Kanonirs","id":"37945265000"},{"name":"Leo Selavo","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Selavo","id":"37686006900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0513-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0512-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0511-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-2936"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-2944"}],"articleNumber":"5982206","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":187,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":4778},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time pothole detection using Android smartphones with accelerometers","abstract":"The importance of the road infrastructure for the society could be compared with importance of blood vessels for humans.

A distributed file system integrates many file servers on the network and becomes an efficiency file system with large storage space. Users can access their files anytime and anywhere. However, the cost for building and maintaining these storage systems is high for many small enterprises and organizations. Thus, a reliable file system with low cost and large storage space is necessary for many users. In this paper, we proposed a low cost distributed file system. The proposed file system stores the file replications in different network area. We also design a load detection module in the proposed system.

In the MAP-based SAGE algorithm we divide a sub-frame of MIMO system into some sub-blocks and use the MAP-based SAGE algorithm in each sub-block. At the head of each sub-frame, we insert a training symbol which is used to initial estimation at the beginning. In the iteration process, we apply channel estimation of the previous sub-block to initial estimation in the current sub-block by ML detection. In the current sub-block we update channel estimate and data detection by iteration until converge. In each iteration process, only part of the transmit antennas is updated. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982260","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967841/5982227/05982260.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982227","startPage":"82","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MAP-based SAGE channel estimation and data detection joint algorithm for MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A MAP-based SAGE channel estimation and data detection joint algorithm for MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982260/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12189474","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982260/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MAP-based SAGE channel estimation and data detection joint algorithm for MIMO system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"021E007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043153S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967841","isNumber":"5982227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967841","xplore-issue":"5982227","articleId":"5982260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5982271,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Hu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Feng Hu","id":"37961442000"},{"name":"Libiao Jin","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Libiao Jin","id":"37956417900"},{"name":"Jianzeng Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianzeng Li","id":"37934381200"},{"name":"Fang Wu","affiliation":["Telecommunication Planning Research, Institute of MIIT P.R.China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fang Wu","id":"37956240300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9698-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9699-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9697-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5982271","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Maximum likelihood decoding","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","diversity reception","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels","space-time block codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active constellation extension architecture","STBC MIMO decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","space-time block coding scheme","multiple input multiple output communication system","wireless communication","quasistatic fading channel scenario","ML decoder","decision statistic","Euclidean distance","diversity coding","transmit antennas","bit error rates","QPSK","8PSK","16-QAM modulation","Rayleigh fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STBC","MIMO","decoding","ML","ACE"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding of the space-time block coding (STBC) scheme used in multiple-input-multiple output (MIMO) communication systems. Assume the existing wireless communication is the quasi-static fading channel scenario. Then the detection of the ML decoder will get very wretched especially when the decision statistic is large at the receiver side. To fix this drawback, the so-called active constellation extension (ACE) algorithm has been proposed to rectify the minimum Euclidean distance for ML decoding where the communication parameters are estimated. This paper presents a detailed study of diversity coding for MIMO systems. Different Complex orthogonal STBC for 3 and 4 transmit antennas are envisaged. Finally, these STBC techniques are implemented and analyzed for performance according to their bit error rates (BER) using QPSK, 8PSK, and 16-QAM modulation scenarios, and simulations are used to validate the robustness of our proposed scheme for Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982271","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967841/5982227/05982271.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An active constellation extension architecture for STBC MIMO decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982271/","displayDocTitle":"An active constellation extension architecture for STBC MIMO decoding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179935","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982271/","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An active constellation extension architecture for STBC MIMO decoding","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"032E036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046282S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967841","isNumber":"5982227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967841","xplore-issue":"5982227","articleId":"5982271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982282,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ying","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Ying","id":"37087258513"},{"name":"Li Jianping","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Jianping","id":"37087258288"},{"name":"Cai Chaoshi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Cai Chaoshi","id":"37087258489"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9698-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9699-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9697-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5982282","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":538},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982282","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Iterative decoding","Fading","Decoding","Bit error rate","AWGN channels","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","decoding","interleaved codes","modulation coding","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BICM-ID","bit-interleaved coded modulation","code diversity maximization","Rayleigh fading channels","AWGN channels","Euclidean distance","iterative decoding","code rates","modulation modes","mapping schemes","iteration numbers","decoding algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BICM","BICM-ID","SISO decoder","extrinsic bit information","LLR"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982227","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of BICM and BICM-ID","startPage":"171","endPage":"174","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967841/5982227/05982282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982282","abstract":"Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is a remarkable scheme by maximizing the code diversity to achieve better reliability over Rayleigh fading channels.

But in the real paper defect detection system, the segmentation thresholds usually change with the paper image luminance which is influenced by many factors. In order to resolve this problem, an adaptive threshold segmentation method based on BP neural network is proposed in this paper. For this method, BP neural network models are created and trained to obtain the segmentation thresholds according to the image luminance and the defects are segmented with these thresholds obtained by the network. This method is especially suitable for detecting three typical types of paper defects: dark spot, light spot and hole. The experiment results indicate that this method is efficient and can be applied to modern paper defect inspection system.","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982338","pdfPath":"/iel5/5967841/5982227/05982338.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"408","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2011.5982338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive threshold segmentation method based on BP neural network for paper defect detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive threshold segmentation method based on BP neural network for paper defect detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12179992","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982338/","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive threshold segmentation method based on BP neural network for paper defect detection","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"099S069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07546S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5967841","isNumber":"5982227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5967841","xplore-issue":"5982227","articleId":"5982338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5982349,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Chinas National Linguistic Information Technology, Northwest University for Nationalities, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Tao Jiang","id":"37898362400"},{"name":"Hongzhi Yu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Chinas National Linguistic Information Technology, Northwest University for Nationalities, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hongzhi Yu","id":"37533943900"},{"name":"Yangkyi Jam","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Chinas National Linguistic Information Technology, Northwest University for Nationalities, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yangkyi Jam","id":"37945398000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9698-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9699-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9697-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5982349","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"abstract":"Unlike English and other western languages, there are no delimiters to mark word boundaries in both Chinese and Tibetan.

Microwave observations are less affected by clouds, water vapor, and aerosol and also contain valuable soil moisture information. However, a critical limitation in microwave observations is the coarse spatial resolution attributed to the complex retrieval process. The objective of the current study is to develop an independent (from ground observations) downscaling approach that merges information from higher spatial resolution MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (~1 km) with lower spatial resolution AMSR-E (~25 km) to obtain soil moisture estimates at the MODIS scale (~1 km). We compare the developed (UCLA) method against a range of previous published approaches. Various key factors (i.e., surface temperature, vegetation indexes, and albedo) derived from MODIS provide information on relative variations in surface wetness conditions and contribute weighting parameters for downscaling the larger AMSR-E soil moisture footprints. Evaluation of the various downscaled soil moisture products is undertaken at the SMEX04 site in southern Arizona. Results show that the UCLA downscaling technique, as well as the previously published Merlin method, significantly improves the limited spatial variability of the current AMSR-E product. Spatial correlation (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n) values improved from -0.08 to 0.34 and 0.27 for the Merlin and UCLA methods, respectively. The evaluated triangle-based methods show poorer performance over the study domain. Results from the current study yield insight on the integration of multiscale remote sensing data in various downscaling methods and the usefulness of MODIS observations in compensating for low-resolution microwave observations.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2161318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6133465/05982382.pdf","startPage":"446","endPage":"460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2161318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving Spatial Soil Moisture Representation Through Integration of AMSR-E and MODIS Products","volume":"50","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982382/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12477844","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982382/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Spatial Soil Moisture Representation Through Integration of AMSR-E and MODIS Products","sourcePdf":"tgrs-kim-2161318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118549S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6133465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6133465","articleId":"5982382","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5982386,"authors":[{"name":"Naoto Yokoya","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6133465/5982386/5982386-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naoto Yokoya (S'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in aerospace engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is working toward the Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering.","His research interests include hyperspectral data analysis."]},"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Yokoya","id":"37588926500"},{"name":"Takehisa Yairi","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6133465/5982386/5982386-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Takehisa Yairi received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in aerospace engineering from the University of Tokyo (UT), Tokyo, Japan, in 1996 and 1999, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, UT.

In our scheme, vehicles interact with roadside units to help them generate pseudonyms for anonymous communication. In our setup, the pseudonyms are only known to the vehicles but have no other entities in the network. In addition, our scheme provides an efficient revocation mechanism that allows vehicles to be identified and revoked from the network if needed. Thus, we provide conditional privacy to the vehicles in the system, that is, the vehicles will be anonymous in the network until they are revoked, at which point, they cease to be anonymous.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PACP: An Efficient Pseudonymous Authentication-Based Conditional Privacy Protocol for VANETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2156790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6006621/05982404.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2156790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"PACP: An Efficient Pseudonymous Authentication-Based Conditional Privacy Protocol for VANETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5982404/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206886","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PACP: An Efficient Pseudonymous Authentication-Based Conditional Privacy Protocol for VANETs","sourcePdf":"tits-xue-2156790-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07681S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6006621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"6006621","articleId":"5982404","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5982407,"authors":[{"name":"Boyu Li","affiliation":["Center of Pervasive Communications and Computing, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Boyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37405877800"},{"name":"Hong Ju Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong Ju","lastName":"Park","id":"37308673800"},{"name":"Ender Ayanoglu","affiliation":["Center of Pervasive Communications and Computing, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ender","lastName":"Ayanoglu","id":"37274938000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982407","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Measurement","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Interleaved codes","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interleaved codes","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singular value decomposition","channel matrix","transmitter","receiver","bit-interleaved coded multiple beamforming","code rate","constellation precoding","BICMB-CP","decoding complexity","sphere decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","magnitude reduction","MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Beamforming","Constellation Precoding","Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation","SD","Decoding Complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982407","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982407","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","abstract":"Multiple beamforming is realized by singular value decomposition of the channel matrix which is assumed to be known to both the transmitter and the receiver.

Uplink ergodic sum-rate capacity of a multicell joint processing (MJP) system employing dual polarized antennas is evaluated through theoretical analysis. Results are supported by numerical simulations. The designed system incorporates uniformly distributed users, path loss and Rayleigh fading, thus extending the well known Wyner model. Optimal and MMSE receiver architectures are compared in terms of capacity and complexity. System capacity is calculated with respect to cell size or cross polar discrimination (XPD). The results support the use of dual-polar decoding for low XPD, dense cellular systems while per polarization processing is acceptable in high XPD, sparse systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Antennas","Decoding","Joints","Microprocessors","Receivers","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","cellular radio","decoding","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated multipoint decoding","dual-polarized antennas","coordinated multipoint processing","cellular networks","multiple antenna systems","next generation wireless communications","MIMO technology","antenna separation","transceivers","uplink ergodic sum-rate capacity","multicell joint processing system","dual polarized antennas","Rayleigh fading","Wyner model","MMSE receiver architectures","cross polar discrimination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CoMP","Multicell Joint Decoding","Dual Polarization","Optimal/MMSE Capacity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982408","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982408.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated multi-point decoding with dual-polarized antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated multi-point decoding with dual-polarized antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982408/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982408/","accessionNumber":"12179046","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated multi-point decoding with dual-polarized antennas","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0274457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060266S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5982411,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, ChangSha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37713242700"},{"name":"Dongsong Ban","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, ChangSha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Dongsong","lastName":"Ban","id":"37711127600"},{"name":"Weifa Liang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Weifa","lastName":"Liang","id":"37279572200"},{"name":"Wenhua Dou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, ChangSha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Dou","id":"37284449700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982411","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","computational complexity","genetic algorithms","nonlinear programming","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint resource allocation","cooperative cognitive radio networks","primary user","secondary users","joint channel allocation","cooperation set partition problem","0-1 nonlinear programming model","NP-hardness","suboptimal centralized genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative cognitive radio networks","channel allocation","cooperation set partition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982411","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982411","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","abstract":"Existing literature in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks (CCRNs) always assumed a scenario where only one Primary User (PU) and several Secondary Users (SUs) coexist. However, in practice, multi-PUs and multi-SUs always coexist and the number of SUs is usually greater than that of PUs. Under such complex yet real scenarios, we assume that each PU not only allows a set of SUs to access its pre-allocated channel, but can leverage some of these SUs to improve its transmission rate via cooperative technologies. We consider a joint channel allocation and cooperation set partition problem in CCRNs, in which we aim to allocate a channel and assign a cooperation set that consists of several SUs for each PU, such that for a given period of time, the average transmission rates gained by all the users achieve maximum proportional fairness. We formulate the problem as a 0-1 non-linear programming model. Due to its NP-hardness, we propose a suboptimal Centralized Genetic Algorithm (CGA) for the problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CGA not only converges rapidly, but is shown to perform as well as 92% of the optimal solution delivered by brutal search, in terms of the fitness that reflects the fairness degree of the transmission performance gained by all the users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for joint resource allocation in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982411/","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for joint resource allocation in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179048","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm for joint resource allocation in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0291579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078191S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982414,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Rasouli","affiliation":["WINCORE Laboratory, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Rasouli","id":"37397627800"},{"name":"Alagan Anpalagan","affiliation":["WINCORE Laboratory, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Alagan","lastName":"Anpalagan","id":"37270506600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982414","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"abstract":"The downlink subcarrier allocation in a cooperative multiuser system with an amplify-and-forward relaying is studied for OFDM systems. We use the cooperation coefficient (\u0393) from the literature as a basis for subcarrier allocation. Mean of the coefficient is first derived for Rayleigh faded channel. Then, a well known subcarrier allocation algorithm namely Max-Min is modified to make use of \u0393. In this algorithm, the base station (BS) allocates the subcarriers to the users based on the combination of the direct and weighted indirect subcarrier gains. How to weigh the indirect path depends on the amount of information about \u0393 available at BS. Three different scenarios, each with varying level of implementation complexity, are considered: (a) knowledge of the instantaneous \u0393 at BS, (b) knowledge of the mean of \u0393 at BS, and (c) an estimate of the mean of \u0393 at BS. Finally, the performance of the \u0393-modified Max-Min algorithm is evaluated for the three scenarios using Monte-Carlo simulation. It is shown that (i) the proposed algorithm outperforms the non-cooperative counterpart in terms of total throughput, (ii) the throughput gain moderates with larger group size showing the group diversity behavior in opportunistic communication and (iii) using the mean of the coefficient, instead of instantaneous coefficient, in cooperative subcarrier allocation provides comparable performance in Rayleigh faded channel environment, giving implementation advantage to the mean-based implementation of the \u0393-modified Max-Min algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982414.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An opportunistic subcarrier allocation algorithm based on cooperative coefficient for OFDM relaying systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","OFDM","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","minimax techniques","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic subcarrier allocation","cooperative coefficient","OFDM relaying systems","cooperative multiuser system","amplify-and-forward relaying","cooperation coefficient","Rayleigh faded channel","max-min algorithm","base station","Monte-Carlo simulation","group diversity","opportunistic communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative system","subcarrier allocation","opportunistic transmission","OFDM","cooperation coefficient","amplify-and-forward relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An opportunistic subcarrier allocation algorithm based on cooperative coefficient for OFDM relaying systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12213451","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An opportunistic subcarrier allocation algorithm based on cooperative coefficient for OFDM relaying systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0311309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042693S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5982443,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The network consists of multiple source-destination node pairs assisted by a MIMO-relay node. The channel state information (CSI) available at the relay node is assumed to be imperfect. We consider robust designs for two models of CSI error. The first model is a stochastic error (SE) model, where the probability distribution of the CSI error is Gaussian. This model is applicable when the imperfect CSI is mainly due to errors in channel estimation. For this model, we propose robust minimum sum mean square error (SMSE), MSE-balancing, and relay transmit power minimizing precoder designs. The next model for the CSI error is a norm-bounded error (NBE) model, where the CSI error can be specified by an uncertainty set. This model is applicable when the CSI error is dominated by quantization errors. In this case, we adopt a worst-case design approach. For this model, we propose a robust precoder design that minimizes total relay transmit power under constraints on MSEs at the destination nodes. We show that the proposed robust design problems can be reformulated as convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently using interior-point methods. We demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed design through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2164401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6041052/05982443.pdf","startPage":"5473","endPage":"5484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2164401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Precoder Optimization in MIMO-Relay Networks With Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Relay Precoder Optimization in MIMO-Relay Networks With Imperfect CSI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982443/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12288340","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982443/","volume":"59","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Precoder Optimization in MIMO-Relay Networks With Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tsp-chockalingam-2164401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107926S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6041052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6041052","articleId":"5982443","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5982454,"authors":[{"name":"Young-June Choi","affiliation":["Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6045674/5982454/5982454-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-June Choi (M'08) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.","From September 2006 to July 2007, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

The existing cellular infrastructure is used to enable the operation of such CRs. Because base stations (BSs) can sense spectrum and exchange the sensed information for the reliable detection of primary users (PUs) and white spaces, we propose a collaborative sensing mechanism based on cell topology, where the BS declares its cell to be PU-free when neither the BS nor its neighboring BSs detect any PU. This way, in a PU-free cell, the following two types of channels are available: 1) channels that are originally licensed for the cellular system and 2) CR channels that are discovered through spectrum sensing. Because the CR channels that operate on TV bands usually suffer less path loss than the cellular channels, we derive two important results. First, each user gains more capacity when accessing a cellular channel than an empty TV channel, as long as intercell interferences are caused by the same sources. Second, assigning TV bands to cell-edge users is better in maximizing cell capacity. These two effects and the performance of the proposed sensing mechanism are verified through numerical evaluation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12291107","htmlLink":"/document/5982454/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Access of TV Spectrum Using Cognitive-Radio-Enabled Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Access of TV Spectrum Using Cognitive-Radio-Enabled Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-choi-2164426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082663S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5982454","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5982455,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph A.

To achieve this objective, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is standardized by the IEEE 802.11p Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) standard. Providing reliable communication performance in a highly dynamic time-varying V2V channel is a challenging task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a dynamic equalization scheme, on top of the existing DSRC technology, that significantly improves the packet error rate (PER) of data transmissions without changing the DSRC standard. We also show a hardware implementation of this scheme based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to demonstrate its implementation feasibility. Furthermore, we extend our improved equalization scheme to various data rate options available in the DSRC standard, showing that the proposed scheme is sufficiently generic to support different types of V2V communication. Finally, we report the results of investigating the dependence of wireless communication performance (in terms of PER and throughput) on various design parameters such as packet length, payload size, and data rate.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2164428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/05982455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2164428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","startPage":"3","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the 802.11p Physical Layer in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the 802.11p Physical Layer in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471771","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5982455/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the 802.11p Physical Layer in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Environments","sourcePdf":"tvt-fernandez-2164428-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093769S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"5982455","onlineDate":"12 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5982470,"authors":[{"name":"Li Dongmei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanyang Institute of Technology, Nanyang, China"],"lastName":"Li Dongmei","id":"37087776777"},{"name":"Huang Xiantong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanyang Institute of Technology, Nanyang, China"],"lastName":"Huang Xiantong","id":"37087985850"},{"name":"Yang Xinfeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanyang Institute of Technology, Nanyang, China"],"lastName":"Yang Xinfeng","id":"37087222386"},{"name":"Jiao Xiaoxian","affiliation":["Information and Engineering Department, Henan School of Economics and Management, Nanyang, China"],"lastName":"Jiao Xiaoxian","id":"37087983703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9698-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9699-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9697-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5982470","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982470","abstract":"Comosing test paper is an important part of examination system.

These feedback loss events result in a lack of knowledge about the reception status at different subsets of receivers, which creates a challenge in selecting efficient IDNC packet combinations in subsequent transmissions. To solve this problem for both probabilistic and prolonged feedback loss, we first identify the different possibilities of feedback loss events at the sender and determine their probabilities in both cases. Given these probabilities and the nature of the IDNC completion time problem, we design three blind instantly decodable network coding approaches that perform coding decisions similar to the algorithms proposed in, but on blindly updated graphs to account for feedback events. These three approaches are then compared through extensive simulations. Results show that the full consideration and the full negligence of all the attempted packet requests with probabilistic and prolonged feedback loss events, respectively, in subsequent coding decisions can achieve a tolerable degradation against the perfect feedback performance for relatively high feedback loss probabilities and periods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982501/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12179059","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982501/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Feedback Loss on instantly decodable network coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Feedback Loss on instantly decodable network coding","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0040915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050952S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5982510,"authors":[{"name":"Ilaria Thibault","affiliation":["DEIS/ARCES, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Ilaria","lastName":"Thibault","id":"37945231400"},{"name":"Giovanni E.

Potential gains in terms of received power are compelling, but one of the main challenges is to achieve coherence of the transmitted signals at the destination in such a distributed scenario.

Most of the research in CR design ignores the cost of channel handover process (CHP) in cognition cycle. However, CHP can be a time consuming process that consists of spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, negotiation through control channel, and adjustment of frequency and modulation settings. Taking all of these steps into account, we deduce that the frequency of CHP is one of the most critical CR design issues. In this sense, initiating the CHP after detecting each primary user (PU) activity can decrease the aggregated spectrum utilization. In this paper, we analyze the trade-off between initiating a CHP to find an idle channel and staying in the current data channel for a while to catch free slots when some PU activity is detected. We propose a novel channel handover strategy (CHS) to balance this trade-off. In this CHS, secondary users (SUs) track only their current data channel and do not need information about the whole spectrum environment to determine whether to start CHP or not. Simulation results show that the proposed CHS can clearly decrease the frequency of handovers and increase the aggregated SU utilization.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982515","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982515.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982515","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","startPage":"107","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel channel handover strategy to improve the throughput in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel channel handover strategy to improve the throughput in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982515/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982515/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179073","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel channel handover strategy to improve the throughput in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0184591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081513S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982518,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Zafar Ali Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Mohammed Zafar Ali","lastName":"Khan","id":"37712383600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982518","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Resource management","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential diversity","partial channel state information","MIMO fading channel","SNR","channel estimate","Rayleigh fading channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we derive conditions under which exponential diversity can be achieved when the quality of channel state information degrades.

Givens decomposition of unitary matrices can be used to feedback the eigenvectors of the channel in an efficient way. Several Givens parametrization based quantization methods had been suggested in recent years. In this paper, a simple feedback method that exploits the temporal correlation of the channel is proposed for slowly time-varying MIMO channels based on cyclic Jacobi tracking. The proposed method applies only one Jacobi sweep thus avoiding the need for Givens decomposition. Jacobi solutions are then combined with a novel sign shifting method that reduces the quantization range of one of the parameters by 70%. For uniform quantization and an N \u00d7 M MIMO channel, the proposed method saves approximately M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n - M feedback bits as compared to the state of the art Givens decomposition based methods without a significant decrease in performance. This is shown by a simulation on 4 \u00d7 4 time-varying MIMO channel. It is observed that the capacity penalty of using only one Jacobi sweep is insignificant for highly correlated channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982520.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced quantization range feedback method for time-varying MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Quantization","Transmitters","Delay","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","feedback","Jacobian matrices","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)","space division multiplexing","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced quantization range feedback method","time-varying MIMO system","spatial multiplexing","channel state information","CSI","unitary matrices","eigenvector","Givens parametrization based quantization","temporal correlation","cyclic Jacobi tracking","sign shifting method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Systems","Jacobi Tracking","Limited Feedback","MIMO temporal correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A reduced quantization range feedback method for time-varying MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982520/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179078","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced quantization range feedback method for time-varying MIMO systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0232751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044674S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982521,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Hong Park","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, KAUST, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ki-Hong","lastName":"Park","id":"37539842400"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, KAUST, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982521","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":758},"abstract":"Visible light communication (VLC) using optical sources which can be simultaneously utilized for illumination and communication is currently an attractive option for wireless personal area network.

deployment. However, it remains to be seen how energy efficient it is. In this paper, we assess the energy efficiency of the conventional Amplifyand- forward (AF) scheme in an in-building relaying scenario. This scenario simplifies the mutual information formulation of the AF system and allows us to express its channel capacity with a simple and accurate closed-form approximation. In addition, a framework for the energy efficiency analysis of AF system is introduced, which includes a power consumption model and an energy efficiency metric, i.e. the bit-per-joule capacity. This framework along with our closed-form approximation are utilized for assessing both the channel and bit-per-joule capacities of the AF system in an in-building scenario. Our results indicate that transmitting with maximum power is not energy efficient and that AF system is more energy efficient than point-to-point communication at low transmit powers and signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982523","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982523.pdf","startPage":"912","endPage":"917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency analysis of in-building MIMO AF communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982523/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency analysis of in-building MIMO AF communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179081","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982523/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency analysis of in-building MIMO AF communication","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1574665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063882S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5982539,"authors":[{"name":"Pavithra Venkatraman","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Pavithra","lastName":"Venkatraman","id":"37411495800"},{"name":"Bechir Hamdaoui","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Bechir","lastName":"Hamdaoui","id":"37282036600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982539","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Learning","FCC","Interference","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","learning (artificial intelligence)","radio spectrum management","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative Q-learning","secondary user","dynamic spectrum access","learning scheme","spectrum opportunity","DSA system","throughput","fairness","prediction model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","dynamic spectrum access"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982539","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982539","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","abstract":"In this paper, we present and evaluate learning schemes that allow multiple secondary users to locate and use spectrum opportunities effectively, thus improving efficiency of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) systems.

Their inherent uncoordinated and overlaid deployment however, means existing radio resource management (RRM) techniques are often ineffectual. Recent advances in dynamic RRM have emphasised the need for more efficient resource management strategies. While centralised resource management offers improved coordination and operator control giving better interference management, it is not scalable for increasing nodes. Distributed management techniques in contrast, do afford scaled deployment, but at higher node densities incur performance degradation in both system throughput and link-quality because of poor coordination. The level of spectrum sharing mandated by macro-femto deployment also impacts on system throughput and is scenario dependant. This paper presents a new hybrid resource management algorithm( HRMA) for down-links in orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based systems, with the model analysed for a range of macro-femto deployment scenarios. HRMA employs a dynamic fractional frequency reuse scheme for macro-cell deployment with frequency reuse defined for femto users depending on their location by making certain frequencies locally available based on macro-femto tier information sharing and efficient localised spectrum utilisation. Quantitative performance results confirm the efficacy of the HRMA strategy for various key system metrics including interference minimisation, outage probability and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982545","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982545.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic fractional frequency reuse based hybrid resource management for femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982545/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic fractional frequency reuse based hybrid resource management for femtocell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179103","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982545/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic fractional frequency reuse based hybrid resource management for femtocell networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0474649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074183S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5982552,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Guerreiro","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Guerreiro","id":"37089047650"},{"name":"Edith C.-H.

Unlike traditional periodic data collection, the traffic patterns generated from real-time data collection may expose the interests of users or the locations of unusual events to the attackers. To provide privacy in data collection, we propose a novel probabilistic sampling mechanism that can hide user queries and unusual events in the network, while supporting both routine and on-demand data reporting. Our goal is to prevent attackers from locating the unusual events and identifying interests of users by eavesdropping and analyzing the network traffic. In our probabilistic sampling scheme, the data are carefully reported at random times in order to mask the unusual events and user queries. In the meantime, our scheme can provide users with high data accuracy at minimized communication overheads. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the security strength, data accuracy and communication overheads of the proposed scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982552","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982552.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"319","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-aware probabilistic sampling for data collection in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-aware probabilistic sampling for data collection in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982552/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179110","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982552/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-aware probabilistic sampling for data collection in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0544659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043243S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5982559,"authors":[{"name":"Razieh Razavi","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Razieh","lastName":"Razavi","id":"37720441200"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali Imran","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Ali Imran","id":"37265529100"},{"name":"Rahim Tafazolli","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Rahim","lastName":"Tafazolli","id":"37280285600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982559","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":471},"abstract":"In this paper, the mutual information transfer characteristics of turbo Multiuser Detector (MUD) for a novel air interface scheme, called Low Density Signature Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (LDS-OFDM) are investigated using Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts.

powerline communication (PLC) system employing quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes of multiple code rate and multiple code length is proposed. Combined with proper constellation mappings, 4 transmission modes can be supported, which provides different error correction capabilities. A comparison with the coding scheme in the G3 specification is performed, confirming that the proposed scheme is superior to G3 in terms of both flexibility and reliability while the efficiency is higher than that of G3. A study on the implementation complexity on FPGA is also conducted to prove the feasibility of using the proposed scheme in future practical narrowband PLC system.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982561","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982561.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-rate QC-LDPC scheme for narrowband powerline communication system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-rate QC-LDPC scheme for narrowband powerline communication system","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982561/","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179119","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982561/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-rate QC-LDPC scheme for narrowband powerline communication system","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0634927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056703S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982562,"authors":[{"name":"Ruey-Yi Wei","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Hoglike, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ruey-Yi","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279410300"},{"name":"Chu-Jung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Hoglike, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chu-Jung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37962120700"},{"name":"Yi-Min Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Hoglike, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Min","lastName":"Wu","id":"37966283200"},{"name":"Pei-En Sheih","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Hoglike, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-En","lastName":"Sheih","id":"37945265100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982562","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Viterbi algorithm","Bit error rate","Detectors","Silicon","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","modulation","trellis codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential encoding","nonconstant energy signal","look-up table","bit-assigning algorithm","trellis coding","Viterbi algorithm","differential detector","differential space-time modulation","DSTM","transmitted block"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential encoding","noncoherent detection","quadrature-amplitude modulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982562","abstract":"Recently, we proposed a novel differential encoder for non-constant energy signals, by a look-up table instead of a rule.

A theorem about the sufficient number of states for various modulations is proposed. Finally, we extend the proposed differential encoding and detection to differential space-time modulation (DSTM). We propose a new definition of DSTM, by which the transmitted block is determined according to the previously transmitted block and current data bits. The encoding table that determines the transmitted block can be optimized. We also propose a theorem to reduce the number of states of the decoding trellis.

After the spectrum sensing and decision processes, detected or predicted spectrum holes need to be utilized by the CR users conforming to specific principles. Many approaches are applied in this field, like rule based or artificial intelligence inspired solutions, game theoretic scenarios, scheduling and auctioning. In this paper, we propose a distributed spectrum sharing mechanism that is based on individual spectrum decisions, priority and messaging mechanism between CR users. Here, all users sense and decide the channel occupancy by themselves. Cooperation is acquired by a messaging framework that enables each user to retrieve its neighbors' channel decisions and priorities to use a channel from the common control channel (CCC). In our scheme, we model a messaging topology that represents the deficiencies in CCC. On the other hand, interference graph is chosen to be fully connected. We simulated our network model and spectrum sharing system using MATLAB Simulink environment and extracted the following performance metrics: Traffic Request Satisfaction Rate (TRSR), Channel Occupancy Rate (COR) and Fairness among CR users. The obtained results are compared with other techniques employing rule based channel selection strategies as selfish and random channel selection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982580/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12179138","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982580/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A priority based cooperative spectrum utilization considering noise in common control channel in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A priority based cooperative spectrum utilization considering noise in common control channel in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0824727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066714S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982588,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Our techniques are efficient in terms of optimality, scalability, distributivity, and fairness. First, they enable SUs to achieve high service satisfaction levels by quickly locating and accessing available spectrum opportunities. Second, they are scalable by performing well in systems with small as well as large numbers of SUs. Third, they can be implemented in a decentralized manner by relying on local information only. Finally, they ensure fairness among SUs by allowing them to receive equal amounts of service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12179146","htmlLink":"/document/5982588/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed resource and service management for large-scale dynamic spectrum access systems through coordinated learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed resource and service management for large-scale dynamic spectrum access systems through coordinated learning","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0909043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04695S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982589,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chuan Tseng","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chuan","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37564864600"},{"name":"ChingYao Huang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"ChingYao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281272100"},{"name":"Ahmed Farhan Hanif","affiliation":["TELECOM & Management SudParis, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Ahmed Farhan","lastName":"Hanif","id":"38577314200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982589","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Femtocells","Femtocell networks","Power control","Throughput","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radio links","resource allocation","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic resource management","OFDMA","uplink","base station","cellular system","frequency bands sharing","interference mitigation","femtocell network","resource allocation problem","dynamic subchannel assignment","power allocation algorithm","per-user QoS","subchannel usage ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocells","OFDMA","Dynamic Resource Management","Power Control"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells are small base stations that are usually installed in indoor environments to improve the data rate in coverage holes of cellular systems. Since femtocells are usually deployed in an ad hoc manner by users and share the same frequency bands, interference mitigation becomes the main concerns of resource management function. In this paper, we consider the OFDMA-based femtocell networks, and treat the resource allocation problem by developing dynamic subchannel assignment and power allocation algorithms. The proposed algorithms utilize the user diversity within femtocells and take into account the interference conditions of local and neighboring femtocells. The simulation results show that such dynamic resource assignment provide higher system throughput as well as per-user QoS. Additionally subchannel usage ratio is increased.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982589","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982589.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","startPage":"528","endPage":"533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic resource management for OFDMA-based femtocells in the uplink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic resource management for OFDMA-based femtocells in the uplink","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982589/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179147","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982589/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic resource management for OFDMA-based femtocells in the uplink","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"0914677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055828S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982613,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Ghasemi","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Ghasemi","id":"37280246200"},{"name":"Amir Ali Basri","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Amir Ali","lastName":"Basri","id":"37296244400"},{"name":"John Sydor","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Sydor","id":"37272485000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982613","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telephone sets","Antenna measurements","MIMO","Directive antennas","Gain","Dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","microstrip antennas","MIMO communication","omnidirectional antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive handset antenna","outdoor-to-indoor MIMO system","multiple-input multiple-output system","omnidirectional antenna","MIMO wireless propagation environment","angular spread","power gain","compact four-element prototype handset","directive patch antenna","intelligent beam-steering"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems are typically associated with high scattering and isotropic propagation. The ability of omnidirectional antennas to capture multi-path components coming from all directions has made them a logical choice for MIMO applications. Recently, it has been argued that in some MIMO wireless propagation environments with limited angular spread, directive antennas may actually be beneficial if the power gain of these antennas can compensate the loss of perceived multi-path content. In this work, performance of a compact four-element prototype handset with directive patch antennas is studied in an outdoor-to-indoor 4\u00d74 MIMO wireless system. Measurements confirm that directivity may be used to achieve significant capacity gains if combined with intelligent beam-steering.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of directive handset antennas on the performance of outdoor-to-indoor MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982613","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982613.pdf","startPage":"2192","endPage":"2197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Impact of directive handset antennas on the performance of outdoor-to-indoor MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982613/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12213452","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of directive handset antennas on the performance of outdoor-to-indoor MIMO systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3768249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050595S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5982617,"authors":[{"name":"Pinlu Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pinlu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37593210200"},{"name":"Aiqun Hu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Aiqun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37289343300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982617","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":308},"abstract":"To reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, a two-piecewise companding (TPWC) transform is proposed so as to compress large signal amplitudes and expand small ones with two different linear functions. The TPWC transform can provide significant PAPR reduction with low computational complexity, which is similar to other existing linear transforms. Besides, a good trade-off between PAPR reduction and bit-error-rate (BER) performances can be achieved by carefully choosing the three parameters in the proposed scheme. A good power spectral density (PSD) performance can also be achieved, since there are no inflexion points in the resulting profile. The idea of the two-piecewise transform can be extended to other nonlinear functions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982617.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"623","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-piecewise companding transform for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Discrete Fourier transforms","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-piecewise companding transform","PAPR reduction","OFDM signal","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal","computational complexity","linear transform","bit-error-rate performance","power spectral density","nonlinear function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Two-piecewise companding transform for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982617/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179174","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-piecewise companding transform for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1061429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085386S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982620,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Blind sensing of spectral-holes using a radiometer (energy detectors) is one of the solutions that have been proposed for enabling opportunistic spectrum access. This article revisits the problem of energy detection of an unknown deterministic signal over a myriad of fading environments. Specifically, a new approach (based on the canonical series representations of the generalized Marcum Q-function of real order in conjunction with the derivatives of the moment generating function of signal-to-noise ratio) is proposed to analyze the performance of maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and square-law combining (SLC) energy detectors with independent but non-identically distributed (i.n.d) fading statistics, including Rice and mixed-fading channels. Our analytical framework is also capable of treating the Nakagami-m channels with non-integer fading severity indices as well as halfodd integer values for the time-bandwidth product u. Many of these cases were either intractable with the classical probability density function/contour integral approaches, or that heretofore had resisted simple/computationally efficient solutions. Selected numerical results are also provided for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of MRC and SLC diversity energy detectors over Rice and Nakagami-m channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12213453","htmlLink":"/document/5982620/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Unified analysis of energy detection of unknown signals over generalized fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified analysis of energy detection of unknown signals over generalized fading channels","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1094813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047169S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5982621,"authors":[{"name":"Keqian Yan","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Research Institute of Information Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Keqian","lastName":"Yan","id":"37902302300"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Research Institute of Information Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292384500"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology Research Institute of Information Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37290858000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982621","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"To revive the lack of spectral resources due to the expansion of service requirements and implementation of flexible service transmission, next generation digital television broadcasting system should define frame structures to support efficient and compatible multi-service transmission for different applications, especially terrestrial high definition television (HDTV) and mobile TV services.

We also analyze the proposal, highlighting both the improvements and the drawbacks of the new AKA protocol.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982630","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982630.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"694","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual entity authentication for LTE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mutual entity authentication for LTE","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179183","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982630/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual entity authentication for LTE","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1192455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045046S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5982636,"authors":[{"name":"Safwen Bouanen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Safwen","lastName":"Bouanen","id":"37945380300"},{"name":"Hatem Boujemaa","affiliation":["Higher School of Communications, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hatem","lastName":"Boujemaa","id":"37327151300"},{"name":"Wessam Ajib","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Ajib","id":"37294527900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982636","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Error probability","Decoding","Fading","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive decoding","amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","protocols","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold-based adaptive decode-amplify-forward relaying protocol","cooperative systems","signal to noise ratio","source-relay link","Rayleigh fading channels","symbol error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative Communications","Adaptive relaying"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new adaptive relaying protocol called Threshold-based Adaptive Decode-Amplify- Forward relaying protocol (T-ADAF). In our protocol, the relay compares the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal to the average SNR of the source-relay link. If the SNR of the received signal is greater than the average SNR of the source-relay link, then the relay performs the Amplify-Forward relaying protocol (AF). On the other hand, if the SNR of the received signal does not exceed the average SNR of the source-relay link, then the relay performs the Adaptive Decode-Forward relaying protocol (ADF). The performance of the proposed protocol is investigated and a closed form of its symbol error probability is derived in the presence of Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, a comparison with other relaying protocols such as AF, ADF and SNR-HDAF (SNR-based Hybrid Decode-Amplify-Forward) is made in order to evaluate the performance of our protocol and to show its benefits. We also investigate the T-ADAF protocol with multiple relays and we derived a closed form of its symbol error probability.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982636","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982636.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"730","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold-based Adaptive Decode-Amplify-Forward relaying protocol for cooperative systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Threshold-based Adaptive Decode-Amplify-Forward relaying protocol for cooperative systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982636/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179189","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982636/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold-based Adaptive Decode-Amplify-Forward relaying protocol for cooperative systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1251713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047762S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5982660,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Usman Sheikh","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Muhammad Usman","lastName":"Sheikh","id":"38185003300"},{"name":"Rafa\u0142 Jagusz","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland","Faculty of Electrical Engineering, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Poland"],"firstName":"Rafa\u0142","lastName":"Jagusz","id":"37945225400"},{"name":"Jukka Lempi\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jukka","lastName":"Lempi\u00e4inen","id":"37331874600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982660","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"abstract":"In a race towards 4G technologies, future cellular network like Long Term Evolution (LTE) is competing with high data rates and improved spectrum efficiency. The target of this paper is to evaluate performance of Adaptive MIMO Switching (AMS) in LTE in terms of cell throughput and throughput gain with respect to other antenna configuration. The impact of different intersite distance on the performance of AMS was also investigated in this paper. The assessment was based on simulations using analytical channel model. Kronecker channel model without any Channel State Information (CSI) at transmitter was used for the simulation purposes. Adaptive MIMO switching works on the principle of switching among transmit diversity, receive diversity, and spatial multiplexing in accordance to SINR level. Simulation results reveal that significant improvement in cell throughput can be achieved by applying AMS technique. However, utilization of standard MIMO transmission techniques also improves channel capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982660.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"870","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of Adaptive MIMO Switching in Long Term Evolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Mathematical model","Interference","Receiving antennas","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cellular radio","channel capacity","diversity reception","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","performance evaluation","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","adaptive MIMO switching","long term evolution","4G technology","cellular network","LTE","spectrum efficiency","throughput gain","antenna configuration","analytical channel model","Kronecker channel model","transmit diversity","receive diversity","spatial multiplexing","SINR","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation and coding","Adaptive MIMO switching","Long term evolution","Channel capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of Adaptive MIMO Switching in Long Term Evolution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982660/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179213","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of Adaptive MIMO Switching in Long Term Evolution","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1491815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044772S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982662,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37857538000"},{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37593011500"},{"name":"Zhengding Qiu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengding","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37286155900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982662","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transceivers","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Joints","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint MMSE transceiver design","multiuser nonregenerative MIMO relay system","cellular downlink","mobile station","mean square error","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition","linear signal processing","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiuser MIMO relay","transceiver design","mean square error","user selection"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the multiuser non-regenerative MIMO relay systems in the context of the cellular downlink, where the base station simultaneously transmits data streams to multiple mobile stations through the relay station.

Moreover, two special designs which the linear signal processing is performed at either the base station or relay station are studied, respectively. The closed-form expressions of the transceiver are obtained by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and realized through an iterative algorithm with the guaranteed convergence, which provides a local optimal solution.

We derive a lower bound to the ergodic capacity for this scenario and propose an iterative algorithm that finds lower bound achieving transmit covariance matrices of the source and relay nodes. The solution of the optimization problem in the lower bound expression is given for three cases depending on channel covariance matrices. For one of these cases, it seems that an efficient and fast algorithm achieving the lower bound is not possible. However, under a certain practical channel assumption, we propose a power allocation algorithm that gives a solution much faster than classical convex optimization methods. Moreover, we show that this fast algorithm results in a data rate which is very close to the lower bound to the capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and

At the same time, this operation introduces estimation errors that have to be carefully handled to ensure a reasonable measurement accuracy. Recently, a frequency-based approach has been proposed to catch the impact of such errors in bitrate estimation of IP flows at various time-scales. In particular, a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio has been derived as a function of the packet sampling probability, the bin size, and some basic information about the flow (i.e., first and second order moments of the packet size, and long term average packet-rate). In this work, we adopt this model to design a real-time algorithm that properly tunes the temporal resolution of bitrate estimates available at a router, with the goal of assuring a target measurement accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by computer simulations, carried out using real packet traces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982668/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179221","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Temporal resolution adaptation in real-time bitrate estimation from packed sampled traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal resolution adaptation in real-time bitrate estimation from packed sampled traffic","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2721773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047841S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982701,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Chang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ching Kuo Institute of Management and Health, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Chang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407253400"},{"name":"Kuei-Ping Shih","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuei-Ping","lastName":"Shih","id":"37267411600"},{"name":"Chi-Tao Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Tao","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37403444300"},{"name":"Cing-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cing-Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37965494800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982701","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Bandwidth","Downlink","IEEE 802.16 Standards","Scheduling","Modulation","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst scheduling problem","IEEE 802.16 OFDMA system","downlink traffic","subchannel utilization","burst allocation scheme","burst fragmentation","burst packing scheme","burst swapping scheme","channel compensation","bandwidth utilization ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.16","OFDMA","WiMAX","Burst Allocations"]}],"abstract":"The paper investigates the downlink burst scheduling problem (BSP) in IEEE 802.16 OFDMA systems. To solve the problem, a subchannel-aware burst fragmentation, packing and scheduling (BFPS) algorithm is proposed to schedule the position of each burst with high subchannel utilization and low DL-MAP overhead. BFPS is composed of the burst allocation scheme, burst fragmentation and packing scheme, and the burst swapping scheme. The burst allocation scheme and the burst fragmentation and packing scheme are to reduce the wasted and unused slots in and among bursts, and the DL-MAP control overhead. Moreover, in order for the channel compensation, the burst swapping scheme is used to adjust the positions of bursts.

However, most of the known resource allocation schemes are focused on maximizing the local throughput of each cell, while ignoring the significant effect of inter-cell interference. This paper investigates the problem of resource allocation (i.e., subcarriers and powers) in the uplink of a multi-cell OFDMA network. The problem has a non-convex combinatorial structure and is known to be NP hard. Firstly, we investigate the upper and lower bounds to the average network throughput due to the inherent complexity of implementing the optimal solution. Later, a centralized sub-optimal resource allocation scheme is developed. We further develop less complex centralized and distributed schemes that are well-suited for practical scenarios. The computational complexity of all schemes has been analyzed and the performance is compared through numerical simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed scheme achieves comparable performance to the centralized resource allocation scheme in various scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982703.pdf","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1157","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum rate maximization in the uplink of multi-cell OFDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Complexity theory","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Upper bound","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum rate maximization","multicell OFDMA network","resource allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access network","intercell interference","nonconvex combinatorial structure","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","multi-cell","power control","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sum rate maximization in the uplink of multi-cell OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982703/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179254","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum rate maximization in the uplink of multi-cell OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1974501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061356S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5982704,"authors":[{"name":"Beycan Kahraman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Beycan","lastName":"Kahraman","id":"37946430100"},{"name":"Feza Buzluca","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Feza","lastName":"Buzluca","id":"37316943000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982704","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","IEEE 802.11e Standard","Analytical models","Markov processes","Throughput","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","radio networks","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical model","distributed channel access","cognitive radio network","spectrum scarcity problem","spectrum access mechanism","CR network","enhanced distributed channel access function","access category","low-priority secondary AC user","EDCA parameter","802.11e channel","Wi-Fi system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","802.11e prioritization model","congestion window","arbitrary interframe spacing","CSMA/CA"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radios (CRs) are the most promising solution to underutilization of spectrum and spectrum scarcity problems. However, designing suitable and reliable CRs have many crucial challenges. CRs are required to utilize the spectrum holes, share the spectrum resources with other users and bound harm on primary (licensed) transmission. To overcome these problems an accurate mathematical model for the spectrum access mechanism of the CR networks is mandatory. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for CR networks, which is based on the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function of the 802.11e standard. We divide the users into two different access categories (ACs), namely, primary AC (pAC) and low-priority secondary AC (sAC) users. Here, we benefit from well-known EDCA parameters (CW\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n, CW\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n, AIFS and TXOP) to provide this prioritization. In addition, we determine optimal values of the EDCA parameter set for CRs in order to balance the trade-off between the protection of primary users and the throughput of secondary users. We analyze a single channel environment with saturation performance of two ACs. To verify our analytical model, we also perform simulations. Results obtained from model and simulations show that the proposed channel access protocol for CRs can be reliably used in 802.11e channels without any modification in the existing Wi-Fi systems.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982704","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982704.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982704","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mathematical model for distributed channel access in Cognitive Radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A mathematical model for distributed channel access in Cognitive Radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982704/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982704/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12213459","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mathematical model for distributed channel access in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1984587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100065S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982708,"authors":[{"name":"Maurice Sipouo Ngandjon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Maurice","lastName":"Sipouo Ngandjon","id":"37945220800"},{"name":"Soumaya Cherkaoui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Soumaya","lastName":"Cherkaoui","id":"37320995000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982708","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Wireless communication","Roads","Magnetic sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic sensors","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","vehicular traffic detection","wireless magnetic sensor","signal acquisition","wireless vehicular sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","in-road sensor","wireless magnetic sensor","traffic monitoring"]}],"abstract":"The lifespan of wireless sensors installed on the road for vehicular applications is a critical issue since costly road work and maintenance operations are necessary to replace sensors that cannot be powered.

The proposed algorithm gradually reduces the downlink transmit power of femtocells when they are informed about a nearby macrocell user under interference. This information is given to the femtocells by the macrocell base station through a unidirectional downlink broadcast channel. Simulation results show that the algorithm causes the macrocell to accommodate large number of femtocells within its area, whereas at the same time protecting the macrocell users from any harmful interference.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982714","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982714.pdf","startPage":"1222","endPage":"1226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A downlink power control scheme for interference avoidance in femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982714/","displayDocTitle":"A downlink power control scheme for interference avoidance in femtocells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179264","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982714/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A downlink power control scheme for interference avoidance in femtocells","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2090689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05526S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982716,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37966464600"},{"name":"Murat Torlak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Torlak","id":"37281051200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982716","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Collaboration","Throughput","Cognitive radio","Optimization","Interference","Access protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","optimisation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","autonomous sensing","random access cognitive radio network","CR users","ALOHA protocol","MAC layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sensing","cognitive radios","random access"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of throughput and autonomous sensing in random access cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","endPage":"1237","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982716.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982716","startPage":"1232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982716","abstract":"The main advantages of random access networks are the ability to work with little or no infrastructure and independent transmission of users. Thus, users themselves in a random access network decide when to access the channel. Design of cognitive radio (CR) users in random access networks necessitates integrating unique functions such as spectrum sensing, policy and configuration databases, and self-configuration, etc. Spectrum sensing is especially crucial in terms of determining the channel availability and characterization. The traditional approach to cognitive radio network assumes a centralized spectrum sensing through cooperation of the CR users. However, such centralized approach adds additional level complexity which may not be desired in random access networks. In this paper, we investigate autonomous sensing and random access protocols for cognitive radios such that independent transmission of CR users is still allowed. The proposed methodology eliminates the control channel required in traditional collaborative sensing while preserving gains from cooperation and maintaining tolerable interference levels to the primary users of the spectrum. Our proposed design methodology is demonstrated using the slotted ALOHA protocol as the MAC layer due to its simplicity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12179266","htmlLink":"/document/5982716/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of throughput and autonomous sensing in random access cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of throughput and autonomous sensing in random access cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2114199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061631S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982728,"authors":[{"name":"Karel Bartos","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Bartos","id":"37946397000"},{"name":"Martin Rehak","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Rehak","id":"37720446200"},{"name":"Vojtech Krmicek","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vojtech","lastName":"Krmicek","id":"37946396300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982728","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Feature extraction","IP networks","Entropy","Monitoring","Adaptive systems","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network performance evaluation","computer network security","optimisation","sampling methods","statistical distributions","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","flow sampling optimization","high-speed network traffic monitoring","traffic feature distribution","feature-aware statistical sampling technique","network behavior analysis system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling methods","anomaly detection","network traffic","NetFlow"]}],"abstract":"Sampling techniques are widely employed in high-speed network traffic monitoring to allow the analysis of high traffic volumes with limited resources. Sampling has measurable negative impact on the accuracy of network anomaly detection methods. In our work, we build an integrated model which puts the sampling into the context of the anomaly detection used in the subsequent processing. Using this model, we show that it is possible to perform very efficient sampling with limited impact on traffic feature distributions, thus minimizing the decrease of anomaly detection efficiency. Specifically, we propose an adaptive, feature-aware statistical sampling technique and compare it both formally and empirically with other known sampling techniques - random flow sampling and selective sampling. We study the impact of these sampling techniques on particular anomaly detection methods used in a network behavior analysis system.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982728","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982728.pdf","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing flow sampling for network anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982728/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing flow sampling for network anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179278","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982728/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing flow sampling for network anomaly detection","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2232877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062514S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5982741,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Hoffmann","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37401490300"},{"name":"Daniel Medina","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Medina","id":"37406622800"},{"name":"Adam Wolisz","affiliation":["Telecommunication Networks Group (TKN), Technical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Wolisz","id":"37276547400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982741","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Routing","Internet","Delay","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Internet","internetworking","mobile ad hoc networks","scheduling","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","network routing","gateway allocation","genetic algorithms","aeronautical ad hoc networks","Internet","scheduling problem","wireless ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ad hoc networks","MANET","Internet gateways","aeronautics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982741","abstract":"In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithm approach to solving the joint Internet gateway allocation, routing and scheduling problem in wireless ad hoc networks with the goal of minimizing the average packet delay in the network.

The method offers tradeoff between accurate channel estimation and efficient bandwidth usage as more pilots would allow the algorithm to perform a more accurate estimation but at the cost of less transmitted data.

However, no results have been reported on the scaling laws of distributed cooperative MIMO systems when the number of transmit and receive antennas are of finite size, which is the case in real networks. This paper uses the extended network model to demonstrate that, if the size of distributed MIMO systems is restricted to a finite size, then there is at most a constant gain compared to point-to-point communications. Opportunistic interference management (OIM) is introduced as an alternative to distributed MIMO, and it is shown that it provides higher order gains than distributed cooperative MIMO systems under the same assumption of having a finite number of transmit and receive antennas. More specifically, OIM achieves a throughput capacity of C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n (n) = \u0398 (D log log 2/\u03b8 log n/\u221an log n) in fading channels when the transmission range T(n) is \u03a9 (\u221a2/\u03b8 n), where \u03b8 is a constant parameter close to zero. This constitutes an order gain of \u0398(log log 2/\u0398 log n) compared to point-to-point communications and distributed MIMO systems! Given that it is much easier to implement OIM schemes than distributed cooperative MIMO systems, these results indicate that OIM is a far better choice to making wireless ad hoc networks scale than distributed cooperative MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of distributed MIMO with finite size","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982765","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982765.pdf","startPage":"1529","endPage":"1534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of distributed MIMO with finite size","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982765/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179310","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of distributed MIMO with finite size","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2610041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050353S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982771,"authors":[{"name":"Fourat Haider","affiliation":["Center of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Fourat","lastName":"Haider","id":"38265533700"},{"name":"Mehrdad Dianati","affiliation":["Center of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Dianati","id":"37398308500"},{"name":"Rahim Tafazolli","affiliation":["Center of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Rahim","lastName":"Tafazolli","id":"37280285600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982771","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":672},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Relays","Downlink","Delay","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","scheduling","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile femtocell","MFemtocell","access delay","feedback signalling overhead","capacity signalling overhead","opportunistic scheduling","LTE cellular network","spectral efficiency","feedback signalling reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","mobile femtocell","control signaling"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the impacts of deploying Mobile Femtocell (MFemtocell) in LET networks.

Our system level simulation results indicate that one potential advantage of deploying MFemtocells can contribute to improve spectral efficiency by reducing the amount of feedback signalling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation based study of Mobile Femtocell assisted LTE networks","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982771","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982771.pdf","startPage":"2198","endPage":"2203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A simulation based study of Mobile Femtocell assisted LTE networks","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5982771/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179316","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation based study of Mobile Femtocell assisted LTE networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3772461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057023S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5982774,"authors":[{"name":"Saber Salehkaleybar","affiliation":["Data Network Research Laboratory, Advanced Communications Research Institute, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saber","lastName":"Salehkaleybar","id":"37846239600"},{"name":"Seyyed Arash Majd","affiliation":["Data Network Research Laboratory, Advanced Communications Research Institute, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyyed Arash","lastName":"Majd","id":"37846243200"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Pakravan","affiliation":["Data Network Research Laboratory, Advanced Communications Research Institute, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Pakravan","id":"37298064800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982774","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Markov processes","Sensors","Throughput","Quality of service","Heuristic algorithms","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Markov processes","quality of service","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-aware joint policy","cognitive radio networks","quality of service","SU network","multi secondary users network","OSA","opportunistic spectrum access","decentralized partial observable Markov decision process","Dec-POMDP","PU network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP)","Dynamic Programming (DP)","Quality of Service (QoS)","Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-aware joint policies in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","endPage":"2225","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982774","startPage":"2220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982774","abstract":"One of the most challenging problems in Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) is to design channel sensing-based protocol in multi secondary users (SUs) network. Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for SUs have significant implications on this protocol design. In this paper, we propose a new method to find joint policies for SUs which not only tries to guarantee QoS requirements but also maximize network throughput. We use Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) to formulate interactions between SUs. Meanwhile, a tractable approach for Dec-POMDP is utilized to extract sub-optimum joint policies for large horizons. Among these policies, the QoS-aware joint policy is selected as the joint sensing strategy for SUs. To show the efficiency of the proposed method, we consider two SUs trying to access two-channel primary users (PUs) network modeled by discrete Markov chains. Simulations demonstrate two interesting findings: 1- Optimum joint policies for large horizons can be obtained using the proposed method. 2- Our method outperforms other related works in terms of network throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12179319","htmlLink":"/document/5982774/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"QoS-aware joint policies in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-aware joint policies in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3810281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094385S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982789,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengfeng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengfeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37956804000"},{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37278138800"},{"name":"Pingyi Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pingyi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37277801500"},{"name":"Su Yi","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Yi","id":"37531688100"},{"name":"Ming Lei","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Lei","id":"37707477200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982789","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Throughput","Network coding","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","network coding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal dual-cast beamforming","network coding-based two-way relay transmission","wireless dual-cast channels","maximal dual-cast rate","nonorthogonal user channel","conventional nonnetwork-coding","multiple antennas","relay terminal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple antennas","network coding","two-way relaying","dual-cast transmission","transmit beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982789","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982789","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","abstract":"Dual-cast transmission appears naturally in network coding-based two-way relay systems, where the relay terminal needs to send network coded information to both end users simultaneously.

These relays can forward copies of the same signal to the destination using independent paths to provide spatial diversity. One of the main challenges of cooperative diversity is the throughput loss due to the extra resources needed for relaying. Adaptive modulation can be used to convert the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gain (from the cooperative diversity) to throughput enhancement in order to compensate for the throughput loss. The availability of accurate Channel State Information (CSI) is essential for cooperative-diversity systems. However, perfect CSI is not always available in wireless systems. In this paper, we determine analytically the average throughput and bit error rate (BER) of cooperative-diversity systems with adaptive modulation and imperfect CSI over Rayleigh fading channel. Simulation results are also used for verification. Results show that imperfect CSI slightly lowers the throughput gain of the cooperative-diversity system. However, the cooperative-diversity system with imperfect CSI still outperforms the direct transmission.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982791.pdf","endPage":"1703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of cooperative-diversity wireless systems with adaptive modulation and imperfect channel state information","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982791","startPage":"1698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of cooperative-diversity wireless systems with adaptive modulation and imperfect channel state information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982791/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12179336","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982791/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of cooperative-diversity wireless systems with adaptive modulation and imperfect channel state information","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2913797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073962S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982799,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Slavik","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Slavik","id":"37398219000"},{"name":"Imad Mahgoub","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Imad","lastName":"Mahgoub","id":"37273403500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982799","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982799","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Slabs","Optimization","Mathematical model","Rician channels","Fading","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","particle swarm optimisation","protocols","Rician channels","statistical analysis","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop broadcast protocols","ad hoc wireless networks","vehicular network applications","broadcast communications","distance-to-mean method","node density","spatial distribution pattern","wireless channel conditions","optimal statistical threshold value","black-box optimization algorithms","machine learning techniques","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimization","decision threshold value","node distribution pattern","channel quality","Rician fading parameter","statistical location-assisted broadcast protocol","JiST-SWANS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless ad-hoc networking","multi-hop broadcast","vehicular networking"]}],"abstract":"Multi-hop broadcast is an important component in ad-hoc wireless networks. Some vehicular network (VANET) applications in particular use broadcast communications extensively. We propose using the distance-to-mean method to facilitate these applications. The performance of this method depends heavily on the value of the decision threshold, and it is difficult to choose a value for that threshold that results in good performance across a wide range of network scenarios. Node density, spatial distribution pattern, and wireless channel conditions all affect the optimal statistical threshold value. VANETs exhibit wide ranges of these factors, so protocols designed to support these applications must be adaptive to those variations. In this work we address this design challenge by using black-box optimization algorithms based on machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to automatically discover a decision threshold value for the distance-to-mean method that is simultaneously adaptive to node density, node distribution pattern, and channel quality. The resulting decision surface is a function of the number of neighbors N, the quadrat statistic Q, and the Rician fading parameter K. The result is the Statistical Location-Assisted Broadcast (SLAB) protocol. Evaluations using JiST/SWANS show SLAB achieves high reachability and efficient bandwidth consumption in both urban and highway scenarios with varying node density.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982799","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982799.pdf","startPage":"1742","endPage":"1747","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying machine learning to the design of multi-hop broadcast protocols for VANET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Applying machine learning to the design of multi-hop broadcast protocols for VANET","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179344","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982799/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying machine learning to the design of multi-hop broadcast protocols for VANET","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2994617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065612S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5982812,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangxia Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiangxia","lastName":"Sun","id":"37959840100"},{"name":"Tengyi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Tengyi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37592504600"},{"name":"Danny H.

In fact, lifetime depends on many parameters: the topology of the sensor network, the data aggregation regime in the network, the channel access schemes, the routing protocols, and the energy model for transmission. In this paper, we tackle the routing challenge for maximum lifetime of the sensor network. We introduce a novel linear programming approach to the maximum lifetime routing problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mathematical programming of the maximum lifetime routing problem that considers the operation modes of the node. Solution of the linear programming gives the upper analytical bound for the network lifetime. In order to illustrate the application of the optimization model, we solved the problem for different parameter settings for an example network.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982819","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","startPage":"1865","endPage":"1870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel linear programming formulation of maximum lifetime routing problem in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel linear programming formulation of maximum lifetime routing problem in wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982819/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179363","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982819/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel linear programming formulation of maximum lifetime routing problem in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3204881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05906S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982823,"authors":[{"name":"Elias Yaacoub","affiliation":["QU Wireless Innovations Center, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Yaacoub","id":"37391781400"},{"name":"Abdullah Kadri","affiliation":["QU Wireless Innovations Center, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Kadri","id":"37602386400"},{"name":"Adnan Abu-Dayya","affiliation":["QU Wireless Innovations Center, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Abu-Dayya","id":"38180073600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982823","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Relays","Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Frequency division multiaccess","Time division multiple access","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA communication protocol","wireless sensor networks","leakage detection","underground water infrastructures","underground water pipes","mobile sensor","transmission slots","relay nodes","reservation Aloha protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","OFDMA","reservation Aloha","opportunistic transmission","probabilistic scheduling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an application of wireless sensor networks for leakage detection in underground water pipes is considered.

In this paper a scheduling algorithm is proposed for multimedia services in relay-based cellular networks. The decode-and-forwarding relaying protocol with transparent frame structure is used. The scheduling priority takes into account the packet delay and maximum tolerance packet loss probability for both direct-link users and relay-link users. Since the relay-link users have two hops, the priority factor of the first hop of relay-link users is defined as the average priority factors of relay-link users in the second hop, and a match factor is proposed considering the capacity match between the first hop link and the second hop link for each relay. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves overwhelming significant performance gain on the average packet delay and packet loss rate, although suffering some throughput and fairness reduction.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982824","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982824.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling Algorithm for Multimedia Services in Relay Based OFDMA Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling Algorithm for Multimedia Services in Relay Based OFDMA Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982824/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179368","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982824/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling Algorithm for Multimedia Services in Relay Based OFDMA Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3264829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07798S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5982838,"authors":[{"name":"Xijun Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407466100"},{"name":"Juan Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405230000"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291851800"},{"name":"Zhigang Cao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37275269500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982838","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Encoding","Delay","Decoding","Throughput","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","encoding","interference suppression","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","relays","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORE-4","cognition oriented relaying exploiting 4D spectrum hole","cognitive relay system","quality-of-service","cooperative beamforming","rateless coding","spatial spectrum hole","directional spectrum hole","interference","traffic","spectrum sensing","channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive relaying","spectrum holes","cooperative beamforming","rateless coding","cross-layer design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982838","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982838","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","abstract":"In cognitive relay systems, spectrum holes exist in 4 dimensions (4-D), namely, time, frequency, location, and direction. How to efficiently utilize these different kinds of spectrum holes to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for secondary users (SU) is a challenging task. In this paper, we first identify the benefits of separately applying cooperative beamforming and rateless coding aided relaying technologies. Specifically, cooperative beamforming has the particular advantage of exploiting spatial or directional spectrum holes without causing interference to PUs. On the other hand, rateless coding is capable of utilizing different kinds of spectrum opportunities in an aggregate way with low complexity. Both cooperative beamforming and rateless coding aided cognitive relaying schemes have been proposed to support either elastic or real-time traffics for SUs. Furthermore, we combine cooperative beamforming and rateless coding together in order to provide an efficient and robust way to utilize 4-D spectrum holes in cognitive relay systems, where spectrum sensing and channel estimation may be imperfect. A substantial performance gain can be obtained by the combination, compared to using these two techniques separately.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982406","startPage":"1982","endPage":"1987","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963770/5982406/05982838.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CORE-4: Cognition oriented relaying exploiting 4-D spectrum holes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5982838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5982838/","displayDocTitle":"CORE-4: Cognition oriented relaying exploiting 4-D spectrum holes","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12179382","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CORE-4: Cognition oriented relaying exploiting 4-D spectrum holes","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"3401509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076846S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963770","isNumber":"5982406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963770","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5982406","articleId":"5982838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5982853,"authors":[{"name":"Ruifeng Duan","affiliation":["Communications and Systems Engineering Group, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland"],"firstName":"Ruifeng","lastName":"Duan","id":"37970774200"},{"name":"Mohammed Salem Elmusrati","affiliation":["Communications and Systems Engineering Group, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland"],"firstName":"Mohammed Salem","lastName":"Elmusrati","id":"38520617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9538-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9539-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9537-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"5982853","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed control","power control","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective distributed power control","spectrum-sharing cognitive radio","MODPCCR","SINR","channel state information","CSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","power control","spectrum sharing","multi-objective"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5982853","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982853","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","abstract":"In this paper we propose Multi-objective Distributed Power Control Algorithm for Spectrum-sharing Cognitive Radios (MODPCCR).

To determine the condition of an inaccessible fault in an operating mechanical system, the vibration signal of the machine is continuously monitored by placing sensors close to the source of the vibrations. These signals are further processed to extract the features and identify the status of the machine. This paper deals with a new scheme for the detection and diagnosis of localized defects in machine rotating components based on Self Adaptive Growing Neural Network (SAGNN) classifier which is a novel approach to pattern classification propounded for tackling fault diagnosis tasks. Feature vector is extracted from signal in time domain and SAGNN is trained and used as a diagnosis classifier. In order to evaluate SAGNN, the data sets obtained from vibration signals are classified with both SAGNN and Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifiers. The proposed algorithm is applied to the fault diagnosis of mechanical rotary machine, and the test results show that classification by mean of SAGNN identify the faults of rotary elements (Gears, bearing and belts) more accurately and has better diagnosis performance compared to the RBF.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2011.5983017","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968919/5982972/05983017.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"137","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation (MED)","publicationTitle":"2011 19th Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation (MED)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2011.5983017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring of rotary machine by mean of self adaptive growing neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring of rotary machine by mean of self adaptive growing neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12178691","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983017/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring of rotary machine by mean of self adaptive growing neural network","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"0047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129606S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968919","isNumber":"5982972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5982972","articleId":"5983017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5983141,"authors":[{"name":"Hannes Obweger","affiliation":["UC4 Senactive Software GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Obweger","id":"37541561500"},{"name":"Josef Schiefer","affiliation":["UC4 Senactive Software GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Schiefer","id":"37282619000"},{"name":"Martin Suntinger","affiliation":["UC4 Senactive Software GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Suntinger","id":"37541537300"},{"name":"Florian Breier","affiliation":["UC4 Senactive Software GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Breier","id":"37088022332"},{"name":"Robert Thullner","affiliation":["Secure Business Austria, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Thullner","id":"37888803900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0125-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0124-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0123-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983141","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Monitoring","Databases","Delay","Runtime","Automation","Data visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex event processing logic","event-driven application","business process control","generic CEP framework","event-based application","SARI","standardized event-processing logic","off-the-shelf software","CEP-based architecture","customer-side domain expert","real-time event processing logic","easy-to-use building block","event analysis","workload automation domain"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Event Processing off the shelf - Rapid development of event-driven applications with solution templates","abstract":"Complex Event Processing (CEP) enables companies to monitor and control business processes in near real time.

Based on the event- processing framework SARI, so-called solution templates allow offering well-proven, standardized event-processing logic for common business needs. Delivering many benefits of off-the-shelf software while maintaining the flexibility of a CEP-based architecture, solution templates can easily be tailored to the specific business processes and needs of an individual corporation by customer-side domain experts. Real-time event processing logic is assembled from predefined, easy-to-use building blocks, in a way that fully abstracts from the underlying complexity.

Today the challenge is to integrate these versatile platforms in a wide fleet in order to perform cooperative tasks as surveillance, search & rescue, inspection. The coalition formation problem is a pre-condition for cooperative missions. This problem can be solved with different methodologies from biologically-inspired algorithms to parasocial consensus sampling ones. In this paper a new framework for simulation of unmanned vehicles in cooperative scenarios is first presented. Then a novel method that exploits the benefits of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a coalition formation problem (leader-follower) is introduced. The obtained results evidence the good performance of MPC to solve the problem of coalition formation for unmanned aerial vehicles finding the optimal solution taking into account different kind of constraints. The developed framework allows also to easily change from simulated agent to real one.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2011.5983163","publicationTitle":"2011 19th Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation (MED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation (MED)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968919/5982972/05983163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2011.5983163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5982972","startPage":"406","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation framework for coalition formation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simulation framework for coalition formation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983163/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12178832","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983163/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation framework for coalition formation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"0243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081992S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968919","isNumber":"5982972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5982972","articleId":"5983163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5983178,"authors":[{"name":"Fatiha Nejjari","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatiha","lastName":"Nejjari","id":"37294165800"},{"name":"Damiano Rotondo","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Damiano","lastName":"Rotondo","id":"37945465000"},{"name":"Vicen\u00e7 Puig","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicen\u00e7","lastName":"Puig","id":"37300792700"},{"name":"Mario Innocenti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Sistemi Elettrici e Automazione Facolt\u00e0 di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Innocenti","id":"37267956200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0125-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0124-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0123-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983178","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":646},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line measurements","Observers","Rotors","State feedback","Propellers","Adaptation models","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","MIMO systems","observers","pole assignment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["twin rotor MIMO system","Feedback Instruments Limited","nonlinear model","quasi-LPV system","LMI pole placement approach","linear parameter varying observer-controller"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the linear parameter varying (LPV) modelling and control of the Twin Rotor MIMO System (TRMS) developed by Feedback Instruments Limited.

In this regard, the Channel Assigning Agent (CAA) was introduced at the mobile Internet Protocol (IP) layer to allow cognitive mobile users to use their channel as long as possible, to avoid any increase in interruption loss due to unnecessary channel adaptations. This prior forecasting for the mobile transition actions helps to improve traffic planning and minimize the spectral congestion resulting from mobility. In this paper, the Transport-layer (TCP) performance is examined with the CAA application, to evaluate the TCP/IP interface effects and to analyse the performance on congestion control and capacity utilisation. Results show that CAA deployment increases the reliability of connections, with less aborted calls and more guaranteed load throughputs. Congestion control is performed at the network end by systems with an intermediate CRoF core that intelligently direct traffic according to the available spectrum holes. The proposed model has been very successful, producing a highly stable and scalable network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983268/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12180298","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983268/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive congestion control for mobility in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive congestion control for mobility in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p273aldulaimi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060529S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5983277,"authors":[{"name":"Shahid Mumtaz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Mumtaz","id":"37948237400"},{"name":"Joaquim Bastos","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Joaquim","lastName":"Bastos","id":"37557493900"},{"name":"Jonathan Rodriguez","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37404807200"},{"name":"Christos Verikoukis","affiliation":["Universitat de Barcelona, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Verikoukis","id":"37272215400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0108-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983277","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"abstract":"In this paper a downlink location based adaptive beamforming algorithm (LBA) for OFDMA network is proposed.

can change its operating behavior (transmitter parameters) accordingly. It is intended to coexist with primary users (PUs) for using the underutilized spectrum without any harmful interference. Its key domains are sensing, cognition and adaptation. This paper presents a detailed survey of coexistence techniques used in IEEE 802 wireless network standards family to reduce the interference between different types of networks. It also presents a prototype system for designing and testing cognitive radios built on top of software defined radio in a MATLAB/-Simulink and interfaced with a universal software radio peripheral-2 (USRP2) main-board and RFX2400 daughter board from Ettus Research LLC. The philosophy behind the prototype is to sense, predict and adjust the operating parameters to achieve the desired objectives. The PUs detection (sensing) is performed using the statistical (non-parametric) spectrum estimation techniques, which are more useful in a noisy environment. Regression-based statistical time-series modeling & analysis are carried for PU's channel behavior prediction for spectrum decisions. Software-defined radio is used for reconfigurability to adjust the operating parameters of the cognitive radios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983278/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12189536","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983278/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Building cognitive radios in MATLAB Simulink \u2014 A step towards future wireless technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building cognitive radios in MATLAB Simulink \u2014 A step towards future wireless technology","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p15tabassam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059986S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5983283,"authors":[{"name":"Weisi Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Weisi","lastName":"Guo","id":"38261748300"},{"name":"Tim O'Farrell","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"O'Farrell","id":"37271643800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0108-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983283","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":761},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio access networks","Energy consumption","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Antennas","Power demand","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","energy consumption","mobile antennas","quality of service","radio access networks","scheduling","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["green cellular network","deployment solutions","energy consumption","quality of service","QoS","scheduling","radio access network","vertical sector antenna deployment","performance sensitivity analysis"]}],"abstract":"A prominent challenge faced by the communication industry and society is the reduction of energy consumption. How the cellular network can maintain a quality of service (QoS), whilst decreasing its operational energy is investigated from both a deployment and scheduling perspective. This paper presents results showing the dominant factors which reduce the radio access network (RAN) energy consumption and point the way for future research. A large proportion of energy consumption is due to the static overhead power of base-stations and the paper considers sleep mode operation as a solution for a variety of network conditions. Furthermore, a significant contributor to transmission inefficiency is due to the performance of cell edge users. The paper proposes a vertical sector antenna deployment scheme and demonstrate that our proposals can yield significant operational energy and transmission efficiency savings, as well as insight into the tradeoff relationship between energy consumption and network performance. Furthermore, the paper also gives a comprehensive performance sensitivity analysis, which yields insight into both the validity of results and the parameters which can significantly influence future development.","doi":"10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983283","publicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","pdfPath":"/iel5/5972014/5983257/05983283.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green cellular network: Deployment solutions, sensitivity and tradeoffs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983283/","displayDocTitle":"Green cellular network: Deployment solutions, sensitivity and tradeoffs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180309","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983283/","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green cellular network: Deployment solutions, sensitivity and tradeoffs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p42guo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149682S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5983285,"authors":[{"name":"Owayed A.

Two optimization strategies are proposed in order to optimize the overall performance by controlling the number of locally sensed samples at each CR. The proposed strategies contribute to the methods in the literature by taking their performances to the optimist point. Additionally, the effects of spectrum sensing technique type that used locally at each CR, the number of locally sensed samples, the local SNR, and the total number of cooperated CRs on the optimal fusion rule are investigated. An energy detector (ED) and multitaper (MTM) spectrum sensing techniques are examined as local spectrum sensing techniques. The optimal number of sensed samples that minimizes the total error to zero, is found as 417 and 10060 samples when MTM and ED are used, respectively, with local SNR= 10dB and 10 CRs cooperate sensing. The optimal fusion rule is found as 5 out 10 in this case. Thus, using MTM in cooperative sensing is much faster than using ED.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12180311","htmlLink":"/document/5983285/","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"New optimization method for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New optimization method for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p54alghamdi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115309S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5983287,"authors":[{"name":"Neeraj Shrivastava","affiliation":["ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Shrivastava","id":"37947326900"},{"name":"Satya Prakash Singh","affiliation":["ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Satya Prakash","lastName":"Singh","id":"38255337700"},{"name":"Aditya Trivedi","affiliation":["ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37544703600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0108-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983287","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Array signal processing","MIMO","OFDM","Throughput","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","feedback","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random beamforming","feedback","multiple-input multiple-output techniques","cellular system","multiple antennas","channel state information","broadcast transmission","scheduling","multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","channel state information","beamforming","scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Several multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been proposed for the MIMO-OFDM systems.

In this paper, we consider a cellular system employing MIMO-OFDM technique in which base station has multiple antennas and each user feeds back channel state information. For broadcast transmission, the base station performs joint scheduling and beamforming with the goal of maximizing the system throughput. We propose an approach for joint scheduling and beamforming which exploits orthogonality conditions of the scheduled users with reduced feedback.

By introducing a tracking term in the BEM coefficients, giving the rate of change in the coefficients, the algorithm is particularly suitable for high mobility applications.

Recently, spectrum leasing has been proposed as a powerful technique for spectrum management in communication networks. In this paper, we propose an auction-based joint spectrum leasing and relay-based cooperative communication for OFDM systems. In this scenario, the primary user leases its resources to a secondary user as a remuneration for its cooperation. An iterative auction-based spectrum leasing scheme between the primary and secondary networks is assumed in this process. The amount of resources that have to be leased to the secondary users and the process of selecting the best relay for this purpose are also investigated. Numerical results show that the primary network can achieve a higher data rate by this cooperation compared to the case where no cooperation is exploited. Besides, secondary users can increase their quality of service via this cooperation process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983295/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12189540","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983295/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An auction-based approach for spectrum leasing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An auction-based approach for spectrum leasing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p106mousavitoroujeni.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04177S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5983298,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Tian","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Tian","id":"37704680300"},{"name":"Nan Sheng","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37706032700"},{"name":"Fenghua Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Fenghua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37716162900"},{"name":"Baoling Liu","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, China"],"firstName":"Baoling","lastName":"Liu","id":"37558298800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0108-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983298","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Channel models","Microcell networks","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Antenna arrays","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","microcellular radio","MIMO communication","next generation networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcell","Femtocell","channel measurement","next generation mobile wireless communication systems","field wideband multiinput multioutput","MIMO channel measurement"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell, as a new emerging deployment scenario for next generation mobile wireless communication systems, has attracted more and more attention recently for providing sufficient indoor coverage and stable backhaul link. The interference problem is publicly known as a key for femtocells to be widely deployed. So lots of standardizing bodies and research groups are dedicated to the interference study of femtocells. It is well-known that all the evaluation and simulation on interference study should be on the basis of an accurate and unified channel model. However, hitherto there is no a specialized channel model for the work of interference study on femtocells. Therefore, we performed a field wideband multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel measurement in an outdoor microcell to indoor femtocell scenario which is a very important scenario in the interference analysis for femtocells in order to obtain the channel characteristics of this scenario. In this paper, large scale parameters such as path loss and shadow fading will be analyzed and modeled to provide parameters for the evaluation and simulation works on femtocells.","doi":"10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983298","publicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","pdfPath":"/iel5/5972014/5983257/05983298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983257","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large scale characteristics analysis in microcell to femtocell scenario based on channel measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large scale characteristics analysis in microcell to femtocell scenario based on channel measurement","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983298/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180320","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983298/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large scale characteristics analysis in microcell to femtocell scenario based on channel measurement","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p122lei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068761S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5983299,"authors":[{"name":"Meryem Simsek","affiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Meryem","lastName":"Simsek","id":"37396279400"},{"name":"Hanguang Wu","affiliation":["MimoOn GmbH, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hanguang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37963837300"},{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37404435000"},{"name":"Tarik Akbudak","affiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Akbudak","id":"37396166100"},{"name":"Andreas Czylwik","affiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Czylwik","id":"38506237400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0108-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983299","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":592},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Wideband","Gain","Macrocell networks","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular arrays","Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell selection modes","3GPP-LTE","macro-femtocell scenarios","UMTS-LTE","macrocellular wireless network","femto base station","user equipments","interference"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells have become an attractive approach for operators to offer extended services on their licensed UMTS/LTE spectrum.

Nevertheless, the detrimental factor in such networks is co-channel interference between macrocells and femtocells, as well as among neighboring femtocells which can dramatically decrease the overall capacity of the network. In this paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, based on an improved decentralized Q-learning algorithm for femtocells sharing the macrocell spectrum. Since the major drawback of Q-learning is its slow convergence, we propose a smart initialization procedure. The proposed algorithm will be compared with a basic Q-learning algorithm and some power control (PC) algorithms from literature, e.g., fixed power allocation, received power based PC. The goal is to show the performance improvement and enhanced convergence.","doi":"10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983301","publicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","pdfPath":"/iel5/5972014/5983257/05983301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983257","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved decentralized Q-learning algorithm for interference reduction in LTE-femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved decentralized Q-learning algorithm for interference reduction in LTE-femtocells","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983301/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189541","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983301/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved decentralized Q-learning algorithm for interference reduction in LTE-femtocells","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p138simsek.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097239S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5983302,"authors":[{"name":"Behnaz Papari","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer, Engineering, KNTU, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Behnaz","lastName":"Papari","id":"37089047938"},{"name":"Davud Asemani","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer, Engineering, KNTU, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Davud","lastName":"Asemani","id":"37299517000"},{"name":"Ali Khakpour","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer, Engineering, KNTU, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Khakpour","id":"37970900700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0109-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0108-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983302","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983302","abstract":"Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are critical components of electronic circuits and represent a main bottleneck for realizing high-speed telecommunication systems. Cognitive Radio is one of the paradigms for wireless communication requiring wide-band ADCs. Time-Interleaved ADC (TI-ADC) is an effective candidate for implementation of wide-band receivers. The performance of TI-ADC is practically limited by errors due to mismatches occurring between channels, leading to a considerable degradation in overall resolution. In this paper, a blind adaptive method is proposed to correct offset errors in TI-ADC. The proposed method is verified through applying to a two-channel TI-ADC. Here, Least-Mean-Squares (LMS) algorithm has been exploited to adaptively estimate and correct offset error. Proposed method is structurally very simple and hence suitable for implementation on integrated circuits. This algorithm not only is computationally efficient but also shows an improvement of 28dB in the performance of a two-channel TI-ADC.","doi":"10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983302","startPage":"144","endPage":"148","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","pdfPath":"/iel5/5972014/5983257/05983302.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Wireless Advanced","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wide-band time-interleaved A/D converter for cognitive radio application with adaptive offset correction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency domain analysis","Least squares approximation","Cognitive radio","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","cognitive radio","least squares approximations","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-band time-interleaved A/D converter","cognitive radio","adaptive offset correction","ADC","electronic circuits","high-speed telecommunication systems","time-interleaved ADC","wide-band receivers","blind adaptive method","least-mean-squares"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-interleaved ADC","least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm","software-defined radio(SDR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A wide-band time-interleaved A/D converter for cognitive radio application with adaptive offset correction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983302/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180323","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wide-band time-interleaved A/D converter for cognitive radio application with adaptive offset correction","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p144papari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098223S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5972014","isNumber":"5983257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972014","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5983257","articleId":"5983302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5983306,"authors":[{"name":"Saba Al-Rubaye","affiliation":["WNCC, School of Engineering and Design, Brunei University, London, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Saba Al-Rubaye (saba.al-rubaye@brunel.ac.uk) is a PhD candidate in the Wireless Network Communication Centre (WNCC) at Brunel University, London, UK.

Autonomous femtocell operations can improve the networks normal services, driven by the growth in consumer numbers. Traditional operators shrink the organizational demands to reduce the amount of traffic, which leads to efficient pilot power configuration. A solution is proposed for a dense wireless environment in order to achieve optimal systematic settings. In this paper, a new adaptive pilot power model is introduced at femtocells, to adapt the transmitted power as a function of clients' positions. In this regard, a novel probability algorithm is developed for power adaptations using mobile station location and speed. This improves the flexibility of the new femtocells in increasing the throughput and reducing power of transmission. Simulation results show the superiority of the new scheme in responding to the changes in the mobile distances, and adjusting the pilot power parameters.

CFB is used initially to train efficiently a lookup table for a predistorted feedforward path. Then, both the CFB and the predistorted feedforward path run simultaneously during transmission. Viewed as a bandwidth-enhancement technique for analog CFB, the feedforward-compensated system shows a linearization bandwidth improvement of almost six times over the unaided feedback system.

The antenna is based on the principle of top-loading of coupled sectorial loop antenna (CSLA). Introducing a series capacitive gap in the top-loading plate and the CSLA fins allows for achieving ultrawideband operation and very low antenna height simultaneously. The proposed structure is also relatively easy and cost-effective to fabricate using standard printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication technology. A parametric study is presented to show the effect of the different dimensions on the antenna performance. A prototype antenna is fabricated and measured. The measurements and simulation results show good agreement and indicate that a VSWR <; 2 over 0.9-6 GHz can be accomplished. It is also shown that the radiation pattern has omnidirectional characteristics over more than two octaves.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2164569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5730210/05983389.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2164569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730210","startPage":"800","endPage":"803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very Low-Profile Top-Loaded UWB Coupled Sectorial Loops Antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Very Low-Profile Top-Loaded UWB Coupled Sectorial Loops Antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983389/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","publicationDate":"2011","accessionNumber":"12204157","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983389/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very Low-Profile Top-Loaded UWB Coupled Sectorial Loops Antenna","sourcePdf":"lawp-elsherbini-2164569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081715S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"5983389","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5983395,"authors":[{"name":"Dima Bykhovsky","affiliation":["Electro-Optical Engineering Department, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Dima","lastName":"Bykhovsky","id":"37594033200"},{"name":"Shlomi Arnon","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomi","lastName":"Arnon","id":"37271167400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5983395","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical reflection","Optical receivers","MIMO","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave reflection","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","optical communication","optical crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unguided optical communication","MIMO bus","free-space optical bus design","interfering effect","scattering","multipath diffusion","crosstalk","multiple-input multiple-output communication","optical multipath","Lambertian reflection scheme","maximum likelihood receiver","transmitter array","receiver array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free-space optical communication","optical interconnections","optical MIMO"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a new unguided free-space optical bus design concept. The major difference between the design presented in this letter and existing line-of-sight free-space solutions is the paradoxical employment of interfering effects, such as scattering, multipath diffusion, and crosstalk, for the purpose of communication performance improvement. The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication paradigm is used to explore the optical multipath that arises from these effects. The use of MIMO also diminishes the problems concerned with the alignment of communication devices over optical axes. A 2 \u00d7 2 optical bus model based on a Lambertian reflection scheme is analyzed. The maximum likelihood (ML) receiver is used to evaluate the bus performance. The outcome from this work is a mathematical model describing the performance of the MIMO bus as a function of the distance between the transmitter and receiver arrays.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2011.2164786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6035866/05983395.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2011.2164786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6035866","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unguided Optical Communication 2 - 2 Mimo Bus Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unguided Optical Communication 2 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\times$</tex></formula> 2 Mimo Bus Implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"21","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"12287772","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983395/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unguided Optical Communication 2 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\times$</tex></formula> 2 Mimo Bus Implementation","sourcePdf":"lpt-bykhovsky-2164786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048157S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6035866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6035866","articleId":"5983395","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5983396,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"38183991200"},{"name":"Lian-Kuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lian-Kuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280379700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5983396","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":704},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical noise","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Adaptive optics","Optical receivers","Frequency estimation","Fiber optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical engineering computing","optical fibre communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind carrier frequency offset estimation","eighth order statistics","coherent optical QAM systems","quadrature amplitude modulation","optical signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent detection","frequency estimation","optical fiber communication","quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)"]}],"abstract":"We propose a carrier frequency offset estimation (FOE) algorithm based on eighth-order statistics for optical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals.

The ADC converts the sampled input voltage to a delay that controls the propagation velocity of a digital pulse. The output digital code is generated based on the propagation length of the pulse in a fixed time window. The effects of quantization noise, jitter, and mismatch are discussed. We show that because of the averaging mechanism of the delay-line, this structure is more power efficient in the presence of noise and mismatch in deep sub-micron CMOS. To show the feasibility of this approach, a 4 bit 1.2 GS/s ADC is designed and fabricated in 65 nm CMOS in an active area of 110 \u03bcm \u00d7 105 \u03bcm. The measured INL and DNL of the ADC are below 0.8 bits and 0.5 bits and it achieves an SNDR of 20.4 dB at Nyquist rate. This delay-line-based ADC consumes 2 mW of power from a 1.2 V supply resulting in 196 fJ/conversion step without using any calibration or post-processing.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2162186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2162186","startPage":"2312","endPage":"2325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6031177/05983413.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6031177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Miniature 2 mW 4 bit 1.2 GS/s Delay-Line-Based ADC in 65 nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Miniature 2 mW 4 bit 1.2 GS/s Delay-Line-Based ADC in 65 nm CMOS","volume":"46","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12261994","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983413/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Miniature 2 mW 4 bit 1.2 GS/s Delay-Line-Based ADC in 65 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-tousi-2162186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086074S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6031177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6031177","articleId":"5983413","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5983414,"authors":[{"name":"Amin M.

A different current switching mechanism is proposed that improves the dynamic performance of binary weighted DACs. Circuit simulation shows an improvement of the rise (fall) time mismatch by a factor of 2 over the conventional structure. It is shown that in a conventional high-speed binary DAC implemented with differential pairs, the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) can be degraded by nearly 6 dB due to the different rise (fall) times of the current switches. Using the proposed current switches, a fully binary weighted DAC with nominal resolution of 6 bit has been fabricated in 0.25-\u03bcm SiGe technology. The measured SFDR is higher than 30.1 dBc up to 5.9-GHz input signal with a 13.4-GHz clock. The DAC can provide 1.1-V peak-to-peak differential output swing over 50 \u03a9 while dissipating 1050 mW. Full-scale 20%-80% fall time and 2% settling time are measured below 18 and 45 ps, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2161879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6016506/05983420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2161879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016506","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 6-bit Fully Binary Digital-to-Analog Converter in 0.25-- SiGe BiCMOS for Optical Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 6-bit Fully Binary Digital-to-Analog Converter in 0.25-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> SiGe BiCMOS for Optical Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219080","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 6-bit Fully Binary Digital-to-Analog Converter in 0.25-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> SiGe BiCMOS for Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-khafaji-2161879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084551S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6016506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6016506","articleId":"5983420","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5983423,"authors":[{"name":"James Ostrowski","affiliation":["Department of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["James Ostrowski (M'10) received the Ph.D. degree in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA.","While at Lehigh, he was awarded second place in the George Nicholson Student Paper competition for his work dealing with symmetry in integer programming.

However, communication trust and security issues still present practical concerns to the deployment of SG. In this paper, to cope with these challenging concerns, we propose a lightweight message authentication scheme features as a basic yet crucial component for secure SG communication framework. Specifically, in the proposed scheme, the smart meters which are distributed at different hierarchical networks of the SG can first achieve mutual authentication and establish the shared session key with Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol. Then, with the shared session key between smart meters and hash-based authentication code technique, the subsequent messages can be authenticated in a lightweight way. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can satisfy the desirable security requirements of SG communications. In addition, extensive simulations have also been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of low latency and few signal message exchanges.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2160661","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6084801/05983424.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2160661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","startPage":"675","endPage":"685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lightweight Message Authentication Scheme for Smart Grid Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Lightweight Message Authentication Scheme for Smart Grid Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983424/","volume":"2","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5983424/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376607","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lightweight Message Authentication Scheme for Smart Grid Communications","sourcePdf":"tsg-lu-2160661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095031S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6084801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"288","xplore-issue":"6084801","articleId":"5983424","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5983426,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["ECIT, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6246737/5983426/5983426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Zhang (M'11) received the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Dalarna University, Sweden, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication from the Queen's University of Belfast, U.K., in 2011.","He worked as a Senior Engineer/Technical Leader on 3G IMS core networks for Alcatel-Lucent China from 2005 to 2007.

An on-demand QM (OD-QM) which is part of a new modular field-programmable gate-array (FPGA)-based TM is presented that dynamically maps active flows to the available physical resources; its scalability is derived from exploiting the observation that there are only a few hundred active flows in a high speed network.

It utilizes 2.3%-16.3% of a Xilinx XC5VSX50t FPGA and works at 111 MHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An On-Demand Queue Management Architecture for a Programmable Traffic Manager","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2162084","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6246737/05983426.pdf","startPage":"1849","endPage":"1862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2162084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6246737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"An On-Demand Queue Management Architecture for a Programmable Traffic Manager","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5983426/","dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12879431","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An On-Demand Queue Management Architecture for a Programmable Traffic Manager","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-woods-2162084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098701S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6246737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6246737","articleId":"5983426","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5983435,"authors":[{"name":"Huali Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059695/5983435/5983435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huali Li received the B.S. degree in remote sensing science and technology from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2007, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing.","Her major research interests include hyperspectral image processing, signal processing, and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Huali","lastName":"Li","id":"37966054900"},{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6059695/5983435/5983435-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Liangpei Zhang received the B.S. degree in physics from Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, in 1982, the M.S. degree in optics from the Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, China, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1998.","He is currently the Head of the Remote Sensing Division with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University.

Inspired by the iterative error analysis (IEA), a hybrid endmember extraction algorithm (HEEA) based on a local window is proposed in this paper, which focuses on improving the accuracy of endmember extraction. HEEA uses the spectral-information-divergence-spectral-angle-distance metric to measure the similarity and the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) method to search for the endmembers, which can decrease the correlation between extracted endmember spectra. Moreover, it is based on a local window which integrates both spatial and spectral aspects to extract endmembers. A synthetic image and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data were tested with the HEEA method, classical IEA, OSP, simplex growing algorithm, sequential maximum angle convex cone, and spectral spatial endmember extraction automatic endmember extraction method. Experimental results indicated that HEEA manifested a slightly better improvement in the rmse and spectrum information than the other methods. The effect was investigated with various SNRs and different window sizes. The robustness of HEEA is better than the classical IEA, even with lower SNR.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6059695/05983435.pdf","startPage":"4223","endPage":"4238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Automatic Endmember Extraction Algorithm Based on a Local Window","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Automatic Endmember Extraction Algorithm Based on a Local Window","volume":"49","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"12326672","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983435/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Automatic Endmember Extraction Algorithm Based on a Local Window","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2162098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131191S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6059695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6059695","articleId":"5983435","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5983436,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Acero","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica y Comunicaciones, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6296744/5983436/5983436-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jes\u00fas Acero (M\u201906) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 1992 and 2005, respectively.","From 1992 to 2000, he was engaged in several industry projects, particularly in custom power supplies for research laboratories.

This parameter is particularly required to design the power electronics associated with each application. However, its value is usually extracted from measurements performed in a previously built prototype, which is an expensive and time-consuming task. In this paper, an analysis of the mutual inductance between two planar circular windings is developed. The analysis takes into account the effect of the media that can be part of the complete system. As a result, an analytical calculation of the mutual inductance with respect to the main parameters of the system such as the number of turns of the coils, geometry, frequency of the currents, and the properties of the media can be carried out. The analysis can also be used to explore the tendencies of the mutual inductance for design purposes and, thus, it allows speeding up the design process. The analysis has been verified by means of experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6296744/05983436.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2164772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2164772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Mutual Inductance of Planar-Lumped Inductive Power Transfer Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Media","Inductance","Ferrites","Impedance","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductive power transmission","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual inductance analysis","planar-lumped inductive power transfer systems","inductively coupled circuits","transformers","contactless energy transfer systems","power electronic design","planar circular windings","coils"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contactless power transfer","frequency-dependent impedance","impedance measurements","inductance measurements","inductors","mutual coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Mutual Inductance of Planar-Lumped Inductive Power Transfer Systems","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5983436/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"12968349","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Mutual Inductance of Planar-Lumped Inductive Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-acero-2164772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094568S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6296744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6296744","articleId":"5983436","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5983439,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This formulation is not only simply realizable but also made the sensorless drive stable in all the four quadrants of operation. Speed estimation does not involve computation of stator or rotor flux. Requirement of no additional sensors makes the drive suitable for retrofit applications. A simple modification of the controller can estimate the stator resistance in all the four quadrants of operation, if speed signal is available. The proposed MRAC-based speed sensorless vector control drive as well as the stator resistance estimation technique has been simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and experimentally validated through a dSPACE-1104-based laboratory prototype.

Using the SC and battery with a good strategy for energy management improves the performance of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The SC modules are dimensioned for peak power requirement, and the battery's module ensures the average power of HEVs. The battery module is connected to dc-bus through a dc/dc converter for the first topology and without a converter for the second configuration. Buck-boost converters are used between the SC and the dc-bus to manage the available energy for all topologies. The originality of this paper stems from its focus on the control methods of the dc-bus voltage and currents, which use adjustable polynomial controllers (correctors based on polynomial approach). These methods are implemented in the PIC18F4431 microcontroller which ensures analog to digital conversion, and the pulsewidth modulation signals generation for dc/dc converters. Due to cost and available components, such as the power semiconductors (IGBT) and the battery, the experimental tests benches are carried out in reduced scale. Through some simulations and experimental results, the performance of the proposed control is shown and analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/05983447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","startPage":"1455","endPage":"1467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial Control Method of DC/DC Converters for DC-Bus Voltage and Currents Management\u2014Battery and Supercapacitors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial Control Method of DC/DC Converters for DC-Bus Voltage and Currents Management\u2014Battery and Supercapacitors","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524209","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5983447/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial Control Method of DC/DC Converters for DC-Bus Voltage and Currents Management\u2014Battery and Supercapacitors","sourcePdf":"tpel-camara-2164581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097405S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"5983447","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5983449,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsheng Yang","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-tech Center, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6222041/5983449/5983449-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongsheng Yang was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1984.

Energy management is always required for the MICs in order to ensure the highest utilization of renewable energy. The MIC-based hybrid power system is a typical multiple-input multiple-output coupling system, and it has multiple operating modes. As a result, the design of the controllers is very complicated. This paper proposes one-cycle control (OCC) for double-input buck converter (DIBC) to eliminate the interactions of the control loops and, thus, to simplify the design of the controllers. The mode transition circuit is further proposed to realize seamless mode transition, according to the available renewable energy and the output power. Small signal models of DIBC in different operating modes are derived. It can be seen that with OCC, the two control loops are independent of each other, and no current regulator is required. Moreover, the design conditions of the output voltage regulator in different operating modes are the same. As a result, the controller design is greatly simplified. An 800-W prototype has been built and tested in the lab and the experimental results validate the proposed OCC.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6222041/05983449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6222041","startPage":"4646","endPage":"4655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-Cycle Control for a Double-Input DC/DC Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"One-Cycle Control for a Double-Input DC/DC Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12805002","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5983449/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-Cycle Control for a Double-Input DC/DC Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-yang-2164582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103228S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6222041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6222041","articleId":"5983449","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5983475,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Hain","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, SpAndH, Sheffield, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"p":["Thomas Hain (M'02) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K.","He is a Senior Lecturer at the Speech and Hearing Group, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., and has worked on speech processing for more than 15 years.

The systems were developed for participation in the Rich Transcription evaluations conducted by the National Institute for Standards and Technology in the years 2007 and 2009 and can process close talking and far field microphone recordings. The paper first discusses fundamental properties of meeting data with special focus on the AMI/AMIDA corpora. This is followed by a description and analysis of improved processing and modeling, with focus on techniques specifically addressing meeting transcription issues such as multi-room recordings or domain variability. In 2007 and 2009, two different strategies of systems building were followed. While in 2007 we used our traditional style system design based on cross adaptation, the 2009 systems were constructed semi-automatically, supported by improved decoders and a new method for system representation. Overall these changes gave a 6%-13% relative reduction in word error rate compared to our 2007 results while at the same time requiring less training material and reducing the real-time factor by five times.

Our system continuously captures the utterances and face poses of each speaker using a microphone array and an omni-directional camera positioned at the center of the meeting table. Through a series of advanced audio processing operations, an overlapping speech signal is enhanced and the components are separated into individual speaker's channels. Then the utterances are sequentially transcribed by our speech recognizer with low latency. In parallel with speech recognition, the activity of each participant (e.g., speaking, laughing, watching someone) and the circumstances of the meeting (e.g., topic, activeness, casualness) are detected and displayed on a browser together with the transcripts. In this paper, we describe our techniques and our attempt to achieve the low-latency monitoring of meetings, and we show our experimental results for real-time meeting transcription.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12467374","htmlLink":"/document/5983476/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Latency Real-Time Meeting Recognition and Understanding Using Distant Microphones and Omni-Directional Camera","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Latency Real-Time Meeting Recognition and Understanding Using Distant Microphones and Omni-Directional Camera","sourcePdf":"tasl-hori-2164527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1253S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6099652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6099652","articleId":"5983476","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5983483,"authors":[{"name":"Jake Gunther","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6099652/5983483/5983483-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jake Gunther (M'95\u2013SM'11) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University (BYU), Provo, UT, in 1994, 1994, and 1998, respectively.","From 1992 to 1994, he was a Research Assistant with the Microwave Earth Remote Sensing Laboratory, BYU.

Recently, researchers have profiled the energy demand of commercial routing platforms and proposed ways to reduce network power consumption. However, the profiles are coarse-grained, and the platforms are inflexible for experimenting with new schemes for saving energy. In this paper, we consider the NetFPGA platform, which is a popular routing platform for networking research, and make three new contributions. First, we obtain fine-grained measurements of the power consumed by the NetFPGA Gigabit router over a range of packet rates and packet sizes. Second, we propose a simple model that breaks down power consumption of the NetFPGA router at the granularity of per-byte storage and per-packet processing. Lastly, we point to ways of saving network energy based on our fine-grained profile of router power consumption. We believe the results reported in this paper are a first-step towards enabling the use of fine-grained measurement data for energy-optimised network architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 4th International Symposium on Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5972229/5983501/05983514.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 4th International Symposium on Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2010.5983514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2010.5983514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical model of power consumption in the NetFPGA Gigabit router","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Energy measurement","Power measurement","Routing","Random access memory","Internet","Green products"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Internet","power consumption","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","netFPGA gigabit router platform","empirical model","exponential bandwidth growth","Internet","network switch","network router","fine-grained measurement","network energy saving","energy-optimised network architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An empirical model of power consumption in the NetFPGA Gigabit router","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"12189769","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical model of power consumption in the NetFPGA Gigabit router","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"p16vishwanath.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049884S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5972229","isNumber":"5983501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972229","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5983501","articleId":"5983514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5983531,"authors":[{"name":"Berk Canberk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Berk","lastName":"Canberk","id":"37304172600"},{"name":"Sema Oktu\u011f","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sema","lastName":"Oktu\u011f","id":"37062696200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9854-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9852-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9853-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1684"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1676"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-1676"}],"articleNumber":"5983531","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Cross layer design","MATLAB","Wireless sensor networks","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xpec","cross-layer spectrum assignment","cognitive radio networks","vacant spectrum bands","licensed users","physical layer","MAC layer","spectrum utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Networks","Cross-Layer Design","Spectrum Assignment","SNR Observations","Throughput","Fairness"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983531","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2010.5983531","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 4th International Symposium on Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems","abstract":"In Cognitive Radio (CR) networks, the licensed but vacant spectrum bands are assigned to the CR users in an opportunistic manner. These assignments should be realized according to the activities of the licensed users in the spectrum as well as the throughput requirements of the CR users. Considering these two main challenges, in this paper, we investigate the spectrum assignment problem in centralized cognitive radio (CR) networks using a cross-layer perspective. The proposed cross-layer approach, so-called Xpec, combines the observation of the licensed users' activities and the throughput requirements of the CR users. More specifically, Xpec takes the SNR observations of the licensed users' activities from the physical layer and the throughput requests of the CR users from the MAC layer to derive a weighted spectrum assignment strategy. The evaluations show that the proposed Xpec provides higher spectrum utilization and better fairness than the traditional layered strategy under heterogeneous channel conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2010.5983531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983501","startPage":"67","endPage":"69","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 4th International Symposium on Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5972229/5983501/05983531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Xpec: A cross-layer spectrum assignment in Cognitive Radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5983531/","displayDocTitle":"Xpec: A cross-layer spectrum assignment in Cognitive Radio networks","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"12181020","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Xpec: A cross-layer spectrum assignment in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"p67canberk.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045037S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5972229","isNumber":"5983501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5972229","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5983501","articleId":"5983531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5983537,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Kardaras","affiliation":["Radiocomp ApS, Hillerod, Denmark"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Kardaras","id":"38361539700"},{"name":"Jose Soler","affiliation":["Networks Technology & Service Platforms group, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Soler","id":"37301382200"},{"name":"Lukasz Brewka","affiliation":["Networks Technology & Service Platforms group, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Lukasz","lastName":"Brewka","id":"37404084100"},{"name":"Lars Dittmann","affiliation":["Networks Technology & Service Platforms group, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Dittmann","id":"37274882600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9854-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9852-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9853-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1684"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1676"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-1676"}],"articleNumber":"5983537","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"abstract":"During the evolution of mobile networks, reusability of network components has been always a main concern.

It has been observed that the optimal power allocation between pilot and information symbols can improve the performance gain by 2.3 dB relative to the equal power allocation between pilot and information symbols, for a system with N=3D512 sub-carriers, and a channel with L=3D40 taps. The SER performance is then compared with Rayleigh-faded as well as Rician-faded channels. It has been further concluded that the SER vs. SNR performance graph in Rayleigh-faded channel environment is better than that in Rician-faded channel. This idea implies that in OFDM case, the SER vs. SNR performance is better in scattered rich channel environments. The SER vs. SNR performance graph is degraded by equal magnitude for both equal-power and optimal-power cases, which implies that the difference between the equal-power and optimal power case is independent of the channel fading model being used. It is also observed that by varying the standard-deviation of the channel, the SER vs. SNR performance graph is not going to be affected if the channel is considered Rayleigh-faded.","doi":"10.1109/ICICT.2011.5983567","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976316/5983539/05983567.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT.2011.5983567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983539","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of OFDM systems based on optimized pilots over Rician and Rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of OFDM systems based on optimized pilots over Rician and Rayleigh fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983567/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192416","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983567/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of OFDM systems based on optimized pilots over Rician and Rayleigh fading channels","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"PID1939857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031289S","chronDate":"23-24 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976316","isNumber":"5983539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976316","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5983539","articleId":"5983567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5983568,"authors":[{"name":"Muahammad Riaz","affiliation":["ACME Centrer of Research in Wireless Communication (ARWiC), Mohammad Ali University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muahammad","lastName":"Riaz","id":"37969004400"},{"name":"Noor M.

In this paper, a double-parallel architecture based on FPGA has been exploited to speed up median filter and edge detection tasks, which are essential steps during image processing. The double-parallel scheme includes an image-level parallel and an operation-level parallel. The image-level parallel is a high-level parallel which divides one image into different parts and processes them concurrently. The operation-level parallel, which is embedded in each image-level parallel thread, fully explores every parallel part inside the concrete algorithms. The corresponding design is based on a DE2 Development Board which contains a CYCLONE II FPGA device. Meanwhile, the same task has also been implemented on PC and DSP for performance comparison. Despite the fact that operating frequencies of used PC and DSP are much higher than FPGA's, FPGA costs less time per computed image than both of them. By taking advantage of the double-parallel technique, the speed/frequency ratio of FPGA is 202 times faster than PC and 147 times faster than DSP. Finally, a detailed discussion about different platforms is conducted, which analyzes advantages and disadvantages of used computing platforms. This paper reveals that the proposed double-parallel scheme can dramatically speed up image processing methods even on a low-cost FPGA platform with low frequency and limited resources, which is very meaningful for practical applications.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975664/5983746/05983754.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVES.2011.5983754","doi":"10.1109/ICVES.2011.5983754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast double-parallel image processing based on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast double-parallel image processing based on FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983754/","conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983754/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12181256","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast double-parallel image processing based on FPGA","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069713S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975664","isNumber":"5983746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975664","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5983746","articleId":"5983754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5983798,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Holakouei","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Holakouei","id":"37706364700"},{"name":"Ad\u00e3o Silva","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ad\u00e3o","lastName":"Silva","id":"37401627600"},{"name":"At\u00edlio Gameiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"At\u00edlio","lastName":"Gameiro","id":"37270506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0680-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0678-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"5983798","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralized multicell MIMO networks","multiuser linear precoding techniques","high-speed backhaul network","optical fiber","joint multicell multiuser processing","block diagonalization algorithm","power allocation algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Multicell processing","Precoding and Power allocation"]}],"abstract":"The aim of this paper is to propose and evaluate multiuser linear precoding techniques for downlink of multicell MIMO based networks. We consider a high-speed backhaul network where the base stations are transparently linked by optical fiber to a central unit. This architecture allows an efficient joint multicell multiuser processing. The proposed precoder is designed in two phases: first the intercell interference is removed by applying a block diagonalization algorithm. Then the system is further optimized by proposing three power allocation algorithms with per-BS power constraint and different complexity tradeoffs: one optimal to minimize the BER and two suboptimal. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated, considering typical pedestrian scenarios based on LTE specifications. Numerical results show that the proposed suboptimal power allocation schemes achieve a performance close to the optimal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear precoding for centralized multicell MIMO networks","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983798","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983798.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Linear precoding for centralized multicell MIMO networks","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983798/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12181035","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear precoding for centralized multicell MIMO networks","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100631S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5983805,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37899898500"},{"name":"Zhenping Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhenping","lastName":"Sun","id":"37599607400"},{"name":"Hangen He","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hangen","lastName":"He","id":"37291666400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0577-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0576-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0575-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5983805","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1223},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983805","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Radar detection","Radar imaging","Vehicle detection","Roads","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","radar detection","road vehicle radar","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-road vehicle detection fusing radar","cross-verification approach","on-road vehicle detection vision data","real-time vision approach","shadow segmentation","matching fusion approach","validation fusion approach","unmatched radar target","real traffic scene"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fusion","vehicle detection","radar","vision","vehicle shadow segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICVES.2011.5983805","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975664/5983746/05983805.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVES.2011.5983805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-road vehicle detection fusing radar and vision","abstract":"This paper presents a cross-verification approach to fuse radar and vision data for vehicle detection.

A regularization term is added to the problem formulation to account for the coupling between the uplink and the downlink directions. This additional term controls the resource allocation via the minimization of the per-user difference between the uplink and downlink rates.

By non-transient anomalies we mean changes in the way environments look that are persistent across time. Such changes may include leaving unattended bags at airport corridors, putting graffiti in building walls or damaging public property. Detecting non-transient anomalies is critical to security and surveillance in indoor and outdoor environments. We argue that existing off-the-shelf solutions to computer vision problems (e.g., image recognition, gesture recognition, text recognition) are not the most efficient when applied to detecting non-transient anomalies due to their associated computational overhead. In this paper we present a neural network-based architecture that addresses some of the limitations of the state of the art. To speed up computations, our architecture supports the processing of a large number of neurons in parallel. To reduce computational overheads, our architecture omits some of the Gaussian kernel-based feature extraction tasks performed by other systems. To classify visual anomalies as non-transient, our architecture uses a codebook-based algorithm which builds a history profile for every image segment. We describe our architecture and present some performance analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983853","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983853.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting non-transient anomalies in visual information using neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983853/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting non-transient anomalies in visual information using neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12181050","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983853/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting non-transient anomalies in visual information using neural networks","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044361S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5983873,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis A.

Clouds consist of a collection of virtualized resources, which include both computational and storage facilities that can be provisioned on demand, depending on the users' needs. Gang Scheduling is an efficient technique for scheduling parallel jobs, already applied in the areas of Grid and Cluster computing. This paper studies the application of Gang Scheduling on a Cloud Computing model, based on the architecture of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The study takes into consideration both performance and cost while integrating mechanisms for job migration and handling of job starvation. The number of Virtual Machines (VMs) available at any moment is dynamic and scales according to the demands of the jobs being serviced. The aforementioned model is studied through simulation in order to analyze the performance and overall cost of Gang Scheduling with migrations and starvation handling. Results highlight that this scheduling strategy can be effectively deployed on Clouds, and that cloud platforms can be viable for HPC or high performance enterprise applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983873","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","startPage":"418","endPage":"423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and cost evaluation of Gang Scheduling in a Cloud Computing system with job migrations and starvation handling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance and cost evaluation of Gang Scheduling in a Cloud Computing system with job migrations and starvation handling","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189785","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and cost evaluation of Gang Scheduling in a Cloud Computing system with job migrations and starvation handling","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078194S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5983879,"authors":[{"name":"ElSayed A.

A cluster-based feedback scheme is proposed such that the range of possible signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the users are divided into several clusters according to the order statistics of the users' SNRs. Each cluster has a corresponding threshold, and the users compare their measured instantaneous SNRs with the thresholds to determine whether and how many bits they should use to feed back their instantaneous SNRs. If a user's instantaneous SNR is lower than a certain threshold, the user does not feed back. Feedback load reduction is thus achieved. For a given number of clusters, the sum rate loss using the cluster-based feedback scheme is investigated. Then the minimum number of clusters given a maximum tolerable sum rate loss is derived. Through simulations, it is shown that, when the number of users is large, full multiuser diversity can be achieved by the proposed feedback scheme, which is more efficient than the conventional schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983899","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","startPage":"573","endPage":"578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback reduction for MIMO broadcast channel with heterogeneous fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feedback reduction for MIMO broadcast channel with heterogeneous fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189791","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5983899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback reduction for MIMO broadcast channel with heterogeneous fading","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057372S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5983900,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Ren Tsai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuh-Ren","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37290160100"},{"name":"Chi-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Hung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37962112600"},{"name":"Yen-Chen Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600603900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0680-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0678-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"5983900","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":331},"abstract":"In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is one of the major technical challenges, which brings serious impact on the hardware implementation. In literature, many schemes have been proposed for PAPR reduction, wherein the selective mapping (SLM) scheme is the most popular and widely discussed approach. However, SLM suffers from very high computational complexity because of the requirement of a large number of inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) operations. In this work, we propose a modified SLM approach based on time-domain sub-block conversion matrices to reduce the computational complexity due to multiple IFFTs. This scheme is modified from the conversion matrix scheme. By dividing the frequency-domain signals into multiple sub-blocks, the number of the valid conversion matrices can be increased, and thus more candidate signals are available for PAPR reduction. By applying our scheme, the number of candidate signals can be increased from 12 in the original conversion matrix scheme to 28 and 128 for the two-subblock and four-subblock cases, respectively. According to the simulations, the PAPR reduction performance can be improved by 0.2 dB - 0.9 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983900.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"584","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity SLM approach based on time-domain sub-block conversion matrices for OFDM PAPR reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Time domain analysis","Computational complexity","Frequency domain analysis","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity SLM approach","time-domain subblock conversion matrices","OFDM PAPR reduction","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","high peak-to-average power ratio","selective mapping scheme","SLM scheme","fast Fourier transformation operations","IFFT operation","frequency-domain signals","conversion matrix scheme","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR","selective mapping","conversion matrix","complexity reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity SLM approach based on time-domain sub-block conversion matrices for OFDM PAPR reduction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12181084","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity SLM approach based on time-domain sub-block conversion matrices for OFDM PAPR reduction","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076527S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5983948,"authors":[{"name":"Angelo De Caro","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica ed Applicazioni Renato M.

Bilinear pairing maps were first used to break cryptosystems (see, for example, ) and later it was realized that the extra structure could be exploited to build cryptosystems with extra properties. Boneh and Franklins identity-based encryption scheme is the most famous early example of what could be achieved using bilinear maps. After that, a plethora of cryptosystems have been designed using bilinear maps. No full and freely available implementation of pairing based cryptography was available until this work. Recent proposals fall short of this goal as either their source code is not available or because they support a limited range of elliptic curve. Moreover, neither one of implements preprocessing that is crucial to reduce the computation time. In this work, we present jPBC a Java port of the PBC library written in C. jPBC provides a full ecosystem of interfaces and classes to simplify the use of the bilinear maps even for a non-cryptographer. jPBC supports different types of elliptic curves, preprocessing which can speedup the computation significantly and it is ready for the mobile world. Moreover a benchmark comparison between jPBC and PBC has been performed to measure the gap between the two libraries. Furthermore jPBC has been benchmarked on different Android mobile platforms.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983948","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983948.pdf","startPage":"850","endPage":"855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"jPBC: Java pairing based cryptography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"jPBC: Java pairing based cryptography","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983948/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12181123","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983948/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"jPBC: Java pairing based cryptography","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059419S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5983961,"authors":[{"name":"Sotiris Karachontzitis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Sotiris","lastName":"Karachontzitis","id":"37392252600"},{"name":"Tasos Dagiuklas","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Systems and Networks, Technological Educational Institute of Messolonghi, Nafpaktos, Greece"],"firstName":"Tasos","lastName":"Dagiuklas","id":"37284259200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0680-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0678-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"5983961","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Power capacitors","Complexity theory","Resource management","OFDM","Wireless communication","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","linear codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chunk-based resource allocation scheme","downlink MIMO-OFDMA channel","linear precoding","OFDM symbol","optimization problem","zero forcing beamforming","ZFB","interuser interference elimination","wireless channels","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource Allocation","OFDMA","MIMO","SDMA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel chunk-based resource allocation scheme for MIMO-OFDMA multiuser downlink channel.

In this work, we take current approaches one step ahead and combine Topology Control (TC) techniques with CR technology, in order to improve operation and performance, even under the stringent and non-uniform arrangements of CR networks (CRNs). We propose a novel node-degree based Topology Control approach, denoted by Enhanced Cognitive Nearest Random Neighbor (e-CNRN), for multi-channel CRNs, aiming at maintaining network connectivity and adapting to environmental changes such as primary user activity and channel conditions. Compared with TC protocols in conventional ad hoc networks, e-CNRN requires only minimal local information and is specially designed to perform under non-uniform node arrangements, rendering e-CNRN a generic and robust distributed TC approach, especially suitable for multichannel CRNs as well. In addition, we leverage e-CNRN for distributively establishing a virtual common control channel for multi-channel CRNs. Through analysis and simulations we validate that e-CNRN guarantees network connectivity, while achieving efficient power control.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983978","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983978.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983978","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology control in multi-channel cognitive radio networks with non-uniform node arrangements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Topology control in multi-channel cognitive radio networks with non-uniform node arrangements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983978/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983978/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189808","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology control in multi-channel cognitive radio networks with non-uniform node arrangements","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13797S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5983979,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Li","id":"37405730700"},{"name":"Ruifeng Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Ruifeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37957944300"},{"name":"Bin Cao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Cao","id":"37400943300"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"},{"name":"Ali Daneshmand","affiliation":["AT and T Laboratories, Middle Town, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Daneshmand","id":"37398349200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0680-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0678-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"5983979","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983979","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Cognitive radio","Ad hoc networks","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","probability","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed cooperative MAC protocol","cognitive radio ad-hoc network","spectrum utilization","cooperative relay","wireless network","cooperative communication","distributed relay selection algorithm","channel gain","channel available probability","Cooper-MAC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cooperative communications","relay selection","Cooper-MAC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983979","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983979.pdf","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed cooperative MAC for cognitive radio Ad-hoc networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio has been suggested as an efficient method for secondary users to promote the efficient utilization of spectrum. Meanwhile, Cooperative relay allows different users or nodes to share resources and to create collaboration through distributed transmission in a wireless networks. The combination of Cognitive radio with cooperative communication could significantly improve the system performance in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks (CRAHNs). In this paper, we discuss how to use cooperative relay to increase the transmission rate in CRAHNs. We first give a new distributed relay selection algorithm, it considers several aspects including channel gain, channel available probability and spectrum heterogeneity of secondary nodes. A cooperative MAC protocol, Cooper-MAC, is then proposed for CRAHNs which enables secondary users to negotiate channels and relays. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Cooper-MAC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983979/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12181146","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5983979/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A distributed cooperative MAC for cognitive radio Ad-hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed cooperative MAC for cognitive radio Ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059974S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5983980,"authors":[{"name":"Evangelos Anifantis","affiliation":["Institute of Communication & Computer Systems (ICCS), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Anifantis","id":"37945604800"},{"name":"Vasileios Karyotis","affiliation":["Institute of Communication & Computer Systems (ICCS), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Karyotis","id":"37392684600"},{"name":"Symeon Papavassiliou","affiliation":["Institute of Communication & Computer Systems (ICCS), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Papavassiliou","id":"37268508000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0680-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0678-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"5983980","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Sensors","Routing","Media Access Protocol","Routing protocols","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","channel allocation","cognitive radio","linear programming","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-based cross-layer adaptations","wireless cognitive radio ad hoc networks","secondary ad hoc users","cognitive-aware MAC protocols","routing protocols","optimal feedback policy","channel assignments","Markov theory","Markov decision process","linear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs)","Spectrum variations","Cross-layer control mechanisms","Markov Decision Processes (MDP)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-based cross-layer adaptations in wireless cognitive radio ad hoc networks","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","endPage":"1049","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05983980.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983980","startPage":"1044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5983980","abstract":"Secondary ad hoc users of Cognitive Radio networks experience constant fluctuations of their link quality due to dynamic traffic behavior of their primary network counterparts. Several cognitive-aware MAC and routing protocols have been proposed in order to counterfeit properly such spectrum variations. In this paper, we introduce a vertical time-based control mechanism in the traditional protocol stack, aiming at properly balancing the inherent trade-off between instant local adaptations at MAC layer, against slower, but more globally aware rerouting reaction mechanisms. Based on localized and independent node decisions, an optimal feedback policy is proposed in order to exploit the most appropriate protocol layer in each case and provide per link channel assignments, such that flow rate requirements are satisfied with the least cost. We use Markov theory to examine the coexistence of primary and secondary networks, while the optimal decision policy is derived via a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and linear programming. Analysis and simulations are used for performance evaluation and together they confirm that the proposed time-based cross-layer feedback strategy contributes to higher network performance regarding flow rate requirements, sensing and rerouting costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5983980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12189809","htmlLink":"/document/5983980/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Time-based cross-layer adaptations in wireless cognitive radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-based cross-layer adaptations in wireless cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"CC146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060315S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5983980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5984012,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsson","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science and HPC2N, Ume\u00e5 University, Umea, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Larsson","id":"37946418300"},{"name":"Daniel Henriksson","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science and HPC2N, Ume\u00e5 University, Umea, Sweden"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Henriksson","id":"37267974700"},{"name":"Erik Elmroth","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science and HPC2N, Ume\u00e5 University, Umea, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Elmroth","id":"37400881000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0680-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0678-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-1346"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"5984012","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":535},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Semantics","IP networks","Computer architecture","Cloud computing","Databases","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","directed graphs","formal specification","scheduling","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internally structured service scheduling","internally structured service monitoring","cloud federation","large-scale service management","service specification","RESERVOIR project","service structure","placement restriction","hierarchical directed acyclic graph","placement constraints","service-level agreements","virtual machines","monitoring data distribution architecture","cross-site compatibility","semantic metadata annotation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984012","abstract":"Cloud infrastructure providers may form Cloud federations to cope with peaks in resource demand and to make large-scale service management simpler for service providers. To realize Cloud federations, a number of technical and managerial difficulties need to be solved. We present ongoing work addressing three related key management topics, namely, specification, scheduling, and monitoring of services. Service providers need to be able to influence how their resources are placed in Cloud federations, as federations may cross national borders or include companies in direct competition with the service provider. Based on related work in the RESERVOIR project, we propose a way to define service structure and placement restrictions using hierarchical directed acyclic graphs. We define a model for scheduling in Cloud federations that abides by the specified placement constraints and minimizes the risk of violating Service-Level Agreements. We present a heuristic that helps the model determine which virtual machines (VMs) are suitable candidates for migration. To aid the scheduler, and to provide unified data to service providers, we also propose a monitoring data distribution architecture that introduces cross-site compatibility by means of semantic metadata annotations.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2011.5984012","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975307/5983788/05984012.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2011.5984012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling and monitoring of internally structured services in Cloud federations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling and monitoring of internally structured services in Cloud federations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12181160","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984012/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling and monitoring of internally structured services in Cloud federations","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"MC08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059454S","chronDate":"June 28 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975307","isNumber":"5983788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975307","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5983788","articleId":"5984012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5984016,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Militano","affiliation":["University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Militano","id":"37540476200"},{"name":"Frank H.P.

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions). We compare SNAD with several competing methods and demonstrate it is significantly more effective: on average it achieves 20-30% greater area under an ROC curve.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975309/5983989/05984061.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ISI.2011.5984061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISI.2011.5984061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging social networks to detect anomalous insider actions in collaborative environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Electronic publishing","Atmospheric measurements","Intrusion detection","Analytical models","Medical services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["groupware","information systems","security of data","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leveraging social networks","anomalous insider actions detection","collaborative environments","collaborative information systems","CIS","shared tasks","complex dynamic systems","broad access privileges","detect threats","insider threat detection models","specialized network anomaly detection","SNAD","extensive empirical evaluation","access logs","electronic health record system","editing logs","Wikipedia","ROC curve"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging social networks to detect anomalous insider actions in collaborative environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984061/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12181205","pubMedId":"25621314","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging social networks to detect anomalous insider actions in collaborative environments","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054877S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975309","isNumber":"5983989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975309","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5983989","articleId":"5984061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984131,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This concept consists of realizing only the blades of a conventional wind turbine (CWT) in the form of a power kite flying at high speed perpendicular to the wind. On the kite are mounted a turbine, an electrical generator and a power electronics converter. The electric power generated is transmitted via a medium voltage cable to the ground. Because of the high flight speed of the power kite, several times the actual wind speed, only a very small swept area of the turbine is required according to Betz's Law and/or a turbine of low weight for the generation of a given electric power. Moreover, because of the high turbine rotational speed, no gear transmission is necessary and the size of the generator is also reduced. For takeoff and landing of the power kite, the turbines act as propellers and the generators as motors, i.e. electric power is supplied so that the system can be maneuvered like a helicopter. In the present work the configuration of power electronics converters for the implementation of a 100kW AWT is considered. The major aspect here is the trade-off between power-to-weight ratio (W/kg) and efficiency. The dependence of cable weight and cable losses on the voltage level of power transmission is investigated, and a comparison made of low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) versions of generators. Furthermore, the interdependence of the weight and efficiency of a bidirectional Dual Active Bridge dc-dc converter for coupling the rectified output voltage of a LV generator to the MV cable is discussed. Based on this, the concept offering the best possible compromise of weight and efficiency in the power electronics system is selected and a model of the control behavior is derived for both power flow directions. A control structure is then proposed and dimensioned. Furthermore, questions of electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety are treated. In conclusion, the essential results of the work are summarized and an outlook on future research is given. To enable the reader to make simplified calculations and a comparison of a CWT with an AWT, the aerodynamic fundamentals of both systems are summarized in highly simplified form in an Appendix, and numerical values are given for the 100kW system discussed in this work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984131/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12207002","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984131/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Conceptualization and multi-objective optimization of the electric system of an Airborne Wind Turbine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conceptualization and multi-objective optimization of the electric system of an Airborne Wind Turbine","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"0032plenarypaper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130606S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5984143,"authors":[{"name":"Huey Chian Foong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Huey Chian Foong","id":"37088005733"},{"name":"Meng Tong Tan","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"lastName":"Meng Tong Tan","id":"37087309384"},{"name":"Yuanjin Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yuanjin Zheng","id":"37087155249"},{"name":"Iris Ng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Iris","lastName":"Ng","id":"37950619700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9312-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9310-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9311-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"5984143","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Next generation networking","Cost function","Mathematical model","Biological cells","Equations","Moment methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","DC-DC power convertors","field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive optimal controller","genetic algorithm","digital DC-DC converter","GA","integral time absolute error","ITAE","Xilinx Virtex-4 field-programmable gate-array","Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA","time 200 ns"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984143","abstract":"This paper presents the design of an adaptive optimal controller based on genetic algorithm (GA) for digital DC-DC converters.

For the use of SOA in applications where timing and dependability are important, it becomes crucial that SOA event processing and service implementations are robust and time bound for a given platform. To this end, formalisms and tools aiding the design is instrumental. In this paper, we present a roadmap for a SOA based on components using the modeling and programming paradigm of Timber. Our vision is to present Timber based software components as services. By using current standards for service descriptions and eventing we will facilitate interoperability with legacy systems. We will develop a compiler tool suit allowing Timber based services to be deployable onto lightweight resource constrained platforms (e.g., sensors and actuators for industrial use). Our goal is to provide design time guarantees on e.g., robustness (safety and liveness), timing properties, and resource utilization for the complete embedded system comprising SOA event communication, event processing together with the service implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984322","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984322.pdf","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1732","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Roadmap for SOA event processing and service execution in real-time using Timber","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Roadmap for SOA event processing and service execution in real-time using Timber","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12207176","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984322/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Roadmap for SOA event processing and service execution in real-time using Timber","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1727gf008559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070476S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5984328,"authors":[{"name":"Tiantian Xie","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aubum University, USA"],"firstName":"Tiantian","lastName":"Xie","id":"37530446300"},{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aubum University, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37533942100"},{"name":"Bogdan Wilamowski","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aubum University, USA"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Wilamowski","id":"37277687500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9312-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9310-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9311-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"5984328","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1028},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison between traditional neural networks and radial basis function networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984328.pdf","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1199","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984328","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radial basis function networks","Training","Testing","Biological neural networks","FCC","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traditional neural networks","radial basis function networks","network model selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","radial basis function networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984328","abstract":"The paper presents the properties of two types of neural networks: traditional neural networks and radial basis function (RBF) networks, both of which are considered as universal approximators.

Implementation of the arctan or atan2 using series expansions is accurate when computational cost is not an issue. However, for embedded applications such implementations cannot be used. As alternative, different approximations are proposed. In this paper, we present an efficient implementation using look-up table with 101-points. The accuracy is then increased by linear interpolation. The arctangent computation is extended to four quadrant operation using particular properties of arctan. The proposed scheme is implemented in a 60MHz microcontroller platform, typical for embedded applications. Comparative evaluations show that the accuracy of the proposed method is better than the reported approximation techniques. The time consumption of the proposed method is significantly less than that of the library function of the same microcontroller platform.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984330","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984330.pdf","startPage":"1206","endPage":"1211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast computation of arctangent functions for embedded applications: A comparative analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast computation of arctangent functions for embedded applications: A comparative analysis","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207183","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984330/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast computation of arctangent functions for embedded applications: A comparative analysis","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1206gf000221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044888S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984336,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Electrostatic actuators are popular in the field of micron or nano technologies but some high-power electrostatic motors have been developed for normal-sized applications. Dual Excitation Multiphase Electrostatic Drive (DEMED) is one of the strongest actuators among them. There are various driving methods for the motor (DEMED), however, regardless of driving methods, developing driving circuits is one of the difficulties for practical applications. To operate the motor, one or two three-phase signals are required and amplitudes of them must be a few kV. Hence multi-channel signal synthesizers and high-power amplifiers are needed for driver circuits. In addition, portability is required for some applications as well. In this research, therefore, quad Direct Digital Synthesizers (DDS) are built inside the one FPGA. In the performance evaluation, this driver circuit generates motor driving signals based on the position command that is given by a higher-level controller. It is confirmed that the electrostatic motor operates following reference position data, by using this FPGA-based motor driver.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Electrostatics","Driver circuits","Electrodes","Force","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic actuators","electrostatic motors","field programmable gate arrays","motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","high-power electrostatic motor","field programmable gate array","electrostatic actuators","micron technologies","nano technologies","dual excitation multiphase electrostatic drive","DEMED","multi-channel signal synthesizers","high-power amplifiers","driver circuits","direct digital synthesizers","higher-level controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984345","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984345","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1300","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984345.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984345/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a signal synthesizer for driving a high-power electrostatic motor","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12207197","htmlLink":"/document/5984345/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a signal synthesizer for driving a high-power electrostatic motor","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1295gf005436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09793S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984374,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Savaghebi","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Savaghebi","id":"37540913900"},{"name":"Josep M.

However, practical applications suffer from problems related to the limited accuracy of the online measurements required to control the power applied through the laser beam. These problems are caused by inherent non-repetitiveness of the process, which is aggravated by the slow response of the PC-based systems used in industry for this kind of applications. In this paper, an FPGA-based system is proposed to overcome the speed limitations of PC-based implementations. Experimental results obtained in an industrial part reconstruction system are presented, demonstrating that the operation speed and the flexibility provided by FPGAs can be advantageously used to improve the performance of laser cladding systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984383.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1508","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based measurement of melt pool size in laser cladding systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Field programmable gate arrays","Cameras","Measurement by laser beam","Powders","Control systems","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","coating techniques","field programmable gate arrays","image processing equipment","integrated circuit measurement","laser beam welding","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based measurement","melt pool size","laser cladding systems","online measurements","industrial part reconstruction system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based measurement of melt pool size in laser cladding systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984383/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207229","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based measurement of melt pool size in laser cladding systems","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1503gf007625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055734S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984385,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The embedded processor core, peripherals, and the power converter model are all implemented into the same FPGA. The digital control algorithm is written in C language and runs on the FPGA embedded processor. The power converter switching model is described in synthesizable VHDL using the VHDL-2008 floating point package, which shortens the design cycle. Using the low-cost hardware and software debugging tools supplied by the FPGA vendor, current and voltages of the power converter model are monitored, and C instructions can be traced while running on the embedded processor core. The power converter VHDL model is stopped when the embedded processor core is halted by the high-level C language debugger. Results show the feasibility of this approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-in-the-loop simulation of FPGA embedded processor based controls for power electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984385","startPage":"1517","endPage":"1522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984385.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-in-the-loop simulation of FPGA embedded processor based controls for power electronics","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984385/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207230","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-in-the-loop simulation of FPGA embedded processor based controls for power electronics","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1517gf001597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099382S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984386,"authors":[{"name":"Luc\u00eda Costas","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Luc\u00eda","lastName":"Costas","id":"38276062500"},{"name":"Pablo Colodr\u00f3n","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Colodr\u00f3n","id":"38277777200"},{"name":"Unnati Ojha","affiliation":["ADAC Laboratory, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Unnati","lastName":"Ojha","id":"37394149900"},{"name":"Juan J.

This integration allows the increasing of the reliability and the efficiency of power systems. However, the massive utilization of VSI can generates problems into the power quality indices of power systems, especially if the power control algorithm has a poor synchronization. Therefore, a good synchronization of power control algorithm helps to keep acceptable power quality indices. This paper presents the FPGA implementation of synchronization and power control of VSI using a variable frequency ADALINE structure. The proposed ADALINE implementation is used for amplitude, frequency and phase detection of the fundamental utility voltage and its harmonics. Fundamental signal information is then employed for the synchronization and power control scheme. The fundamental and harmonics information is employed to evaluate the power flow and the power quality of VSI output current. This evaluation is very useful for power quality problems mitigation. Experimental results, using low power VSI and Xilinx FPGA system, demonstrate the validity of proposition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of fixed and variable frequency ADALINE schemes for grid-connected VSI synchronization","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984397","startPage":"1587","endPage":"1594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984397.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of fixed and variable frequency ADALINE schemes for grid-connected VSI synchronization","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984397/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207240","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of fixed and variable frequency ADALINE schemes for grid-connected VSI synchronization","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1587gf006785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078589S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984398,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Shahbazi","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nancy, GREEN, Universit\u00e9 de Nancy, France","Center of Excellence in Power System Management & Control (CEPSMC), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Shahbazi","id":"37077671100"},{"name":"Arnaud Gaillard","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nancy, GREEN, Universit\u00e9 de Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Gaillard"},{"name":"Philippe Poure","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Instrumentation Electronique de Nancy, LIEN, Universit\u00e9 de Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Poure","id":"37299971000"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Zolghadri","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Power System Management & Control (CEPSMC), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Zolghadri","id":"37278972200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9312-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9310-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9311-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"5984398","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"abstract":"Fast fault detection and converter reconfiguration is necessary for fault tolerant doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) in wind energy conversion systems (WECS) to prevent further damage and to make possible the continuity of service.

In a Smart Grid platform, the optimal coordination of distributed voltage controllers is one of the main issues to address. In this field, the application of traditional hierarchical control paradigms has some disadvantages that could hinder their application in Smart Grids where the constant growth of grid complexity and the need for massive pervasion of Distribution Generation Systems (DGS) require more scalable, more flexible control and regulation paradigms. To try and overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the concept of a decentralized non-hierarchal voltage regulation architecture based on intelligent and cooperative smart entities. The distributed voltage controllers employ traditional sensors to acquire local bus variables and mutually coupled oscillators to assess the main variables that characterize the operation of the global Smart Grid. These variables are then amalgamated by a Fuzzy Inference System in order to identify proper control actions aimed at improving the grid voltage profile and reducing power losses.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984414","startPage":"1679","endPage":"1684","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984414.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decentralized architecture for voltage regulation in Smart Grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Smart grids","Reactive power","Intelligent sensors","Voltage measurement","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralised control","distributed control","distributed power generation","energy resources","fuzzy reasoning","smart power grids","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized architecture","voltage regulation","smart grids","electrical power systems","Web energy networks","distributed energy resources","cooperative energy resources","distributed voltage controllers","hierarchical control paradigms","distribution generation systems","fuzzy inference system","grid voltage profile"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A decentralized architecture for voltage regulation in Smart Grids","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207254","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decentralized architecture for voltage regulation in Smart Grids","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1679gf006211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066216S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984431,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Vazquez","affiliation":["Department Electronics Engineering, University of Seville, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Vazquez","id":"37293845300"},{"name":"Carlos Montero","affiliation":["Department System Engineering and Automation, University of Seville, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Montero","id":"37394209400"},{"name":"Carlos Bordons","affiliation":["Department System Engineering and Automation, University of Seville, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Bordons","id":"37324888700"},{"name":"Leopoldo G.

An MPC using continuous variables is proposed for solving this problem and the output of the controller is used as the reference voltage to be generated by a PWM modulator. The solution of this unconstrained MPC gives rise to an explicit solution that can be computed beforehand, allowing the prediction horizon to be easily extended. Therefore, the effect of the length of the prediction horizon over the system performance is also evaluated in the paper. This study addresses how this parameter should be chosen to minimize the error between the actual and the desired output voltage. The proposed control strategy has been tested on a simulated model of a UPS supplying a three-phase resistor load. This model has been developed using MATLAB/Simulink with PSIM software. The simulation results show that proposed continuous MPC controller achieves high performance and high degree of robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984431","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984431.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","startPage":"1805","endPage":"1810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive control of a VSI with long prediction horizon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive control of a VSI with long prediction horizon","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984431/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207268","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984431/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive control of a VSI with long prediction horizon","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1805gf008923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092654S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984437,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This imposes new challenges on existing grid interface converter topologies and opens new opportunities to be explored. In this paper a new medium voltage multilevel-multistring configuration is introduced based on a three-phase cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter and multiple string dc-dc converters. The proposed configuration enables a large increase of the total capacity of the PV system, while improving power quality and efficiency. The converter structure is very flexible and modular since it decouples the grid converter from the PV string converter, which allows to accomplish independent control goals. The main challenge of the proposed configuration is to handle the inherent power imbalances that occur not only between the different cells of one phase of the converter but also between the three phases. The control strategy to deal with these imbalances is also introduced in this paper. Simulation results of a 7-level CHB for a multistring PV system are presented to validate the proposed topology and control method.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984437","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter multistring topology for large scale photovoltaic systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter multistring topology for large scale photovoltaic systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984437/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207273","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984437/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter multistring topology for large scale photovoltaic systems","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1837gf008745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053137S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984441,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo A.

This paper presents a new three-phase and bi-directional IPT system that is suitable for rapid charging of EVs or high power V2G systems. The proposed system uses a three-phase track, which is coupled to a three-phase pick-up through weak magnetic coupling. Both track and pick-up are var compensated through an inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL) resonant circuit and driven by reversible rectifiers. A mathematical model is presented to show that power transfer from the track (primary) side to the pick-up side in both directions can be controlled through either magnitude or relative phase angle of the voltages generated by reversible rectifiers. The viability of the proposed concept is demonstrated using simulations, and results suggest that the three-phase IPT system is suitable for high power applications and is superior in performance to its single-phase counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984458","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","startPage":"1957","endPage":"1962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-phase bi-directional IPT system for contactless charging of electric vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A three-phase bi-directional IPT system for contactless charging of electric vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984458/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207292","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984458/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-phase bi-directional IPT system for contactless charging of electric vehicles","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1957gf004685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069918S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984466,"authors":[{"name":"Wente Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Wente","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37952536500"},{"name":"Mo-Yuen Chow","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Mo-Yuen","lastName":"Chow","id":"37270002500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9312-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9310-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9311-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"5984466","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC motors","Encryption","Measurement","Heuristic algorithms","Sensors","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent sensors","networked control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trade-off model","secured networked control systems","distributed sensors","actuators","computing processors","communication network","embedded security mechanism","DC motor system","Simulink"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A trade-off model for performance and security in secured Networked Control Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984466","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984466","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2002","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976319/5984066/05984466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2011.5984466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984066","abstract":"Networked Control Systems (NCS) is a fast growing technology that integrates distributed sensors, actuators, and computing processors over a communication network for a vast amount of applications. However, the NCS can be vulnerable to various network attacks when the network used is insecure (e.g., Internet). Thus, secure NCS need to have embedded security mechanism to ensure its security operating requirements, which may sacrifice its performance due to limited system resources. This paper addresses the trade-off between NCS security and its real-time performance and use a secured networked DC motor system for illustration. This paper will present a trade-off model for system dynamic performance and system security. This model can be used to adapt security configurations to provide sufficient protection and satisfy real-time dynamic performance requirements of the NCS simultaneously. The construction of this model includes the development of a set of metrics to quantitatively measure the performance and security levels of NCS and the development of a trade-off objective function incorporating performance and security. A Simulink based test-bed implemented to control the speed of the DC motor is used to illustrate the effectiveness of this model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984466/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984466/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207298","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A trade-off model for performance and security in secured Networked Control Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A trade-off model for performance and security in secured Networked Control Systems","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"1997gf002534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084679S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":5984472,"authors":[{"name":"Pau Mart\u00ed","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Pau","lastName":"Mart\u00ed","id":"37277828900"},{"name":"Manel Velasco","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Velasco","id":"37266090800"},{"name":"Antonio Camacho","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Camacho","id":"37397219200"},{"name":"Enric Xavier Mart\u00edn","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"lastName":"Enric Xavier Mart\u00edn","id":"38020973400"},{"name":"Josep M.

Among other functions, they enable the direct-on-line startup of these machines. Moreover, they allow enhancing their stability during load transients. However, the large currents and stresses to which those elements are subjected during their operation intervals increase the probability of winding deterioration and of eventual breakage. This paper presents a logical extension of a transient-based diagnosis approach, whose application was successfully assessed in conventional induction motors. The method is applied here to diagnose the condition of damper bars in synchronous motors. It is based on the capture of the stator startup current of the machine and its further analysis in order to track the characteristic transient evolutions of a particular fault-related harmonic in the time-frequency map. For this purpose, the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method, is used here as proposed signal processing tool, even though other tools may be also viable. Simulations as well as experimental results on a laboratory synchronous machine prove the validity of the approach for condition monitoring of such elements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984488/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207312","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Empirical Mode Decomposition to condition monitoring of damper bars in synchronous motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Empirical Mode Decomposition to condition monitoring of damper bars in synchronous motors","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"2118gf006092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08096S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5984490,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Frequency-domain results, which are obtained by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to measured stator current time-domain waveforms, are analyzed with the aim of extracting frequency signatures of healthy and faulty motors with broken rotor-bar or bearing problem. Independent components analysis (ICA) is applied for such an aim to the FFT results. The obtained independent components as well as the FFT results are then used to obtain the combined fault signatures. The proposed method overcomes problems occurring in many existing FFT-based methods. Results using laboratory-collected data demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, as well as its immunity against measurement noises and motor parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12207313","htmlLink":"/document/5984490/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Online fault detection of induction motors using frequency domain independent components analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online fault detection of induction motors using frequency domain independent components analysis","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"2132gf002739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117947S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976319","isNumber":"5984066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976319","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5984066","articleId":"5984490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984513,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hsiung Hung","affiliation":["Design Center, Emerging Central Laboratory, Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hsiung","lastName":"Hung","id":"38183144200"},{"name":"Hang-Ting Lue","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hang-Ting","lastName":"Lue","id":"37275349600"},{"name":"Kuo-Pin Chang","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Pin","lastName":"Chang","id":"37857953600"},{"name":"Chih-Ping Chen","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Ping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37065517700"},{"name":"Yi-Hsuan Hsiao","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Hsuan","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37292277000"},{"name":"Shih-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"38179944400"},{"name":"Yen-Hao Shih","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Hao","lastName":"Shih","id":"37275332100"},{"name":"Kuang-Yeu Hsieh","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuang-Yeu","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37275337000"},{"name":"Mars Yang","affiliation":["Technology Development Center, Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mars","lastName":"Yang","id":"37960867600"},{"name":"James Lee","affiliation":["Technology Development Center, Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Lee","id":"37964862200"},{"name":"Szu-Yu Wang","affiliation":["Technology Development Center, Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Szu-Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292847700"},{"name":"Tahone Yang","affiliation":["Technology Development Center, Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tahone","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291214600"},{"name":"Kuang-Chao Chen","affiliation":["Technology Development Center, Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuang-Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291294200"},{"name":"Chih-Yuan Lu","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Yuan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280494800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9949-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-86348-166-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9682"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1562"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1562"}],"articleNumber":"5984513","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":46,"totalDownloads":1322},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly scalable vertical gate (VG) 3D NAND Flash with robust program disturb immunity using a novel PN diode decoding structure","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Technology -

Ring-oscillator (RO, FO = 3) functionality has been demonstrated, showing excellent Vdd scalability. We have also demonstrated logic scan chain functionality and yield improvement by optimizing the gate stack process. An optimized SIT process has been developed to improve short-channel characteristics in devices with a small number of fins in a narrow active area, which is also critical for manufacturability improvement. Various conformal doping techniques for NFET/PFET are optimized to improve device performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12192436","htmlLink":"/document/5984610/","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sub-25nm FinFET with advanced fin formation and short channel effect engineering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-25nm FinFET with advanced fin formation and short channel effect engineering","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T02A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118247S","chronDate":"14-16 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976318","isNumber":"5984315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976318","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5984315","articleId":"5984610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP (Japan Society of Applied Physi","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5984611,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hsun Lin","affiliation":["IBM Research Division, IBM Thomas J.

As a consequence, devices are comprised of arrays of Fins ranging from one (SRAM) to a few tens of Fins. This introduces an intrinsic variation in the device that is absent in conventional planar devices. To build a reliable circuit, model parameters have to be provided that take account of the correct scaling behavior with increasing number of Fins for the composite device. For the first time we address in this paper how a composite Fin device can be modeled correctly. The statistical drive current and leakage current distribution are accurately modeled using the proposed methodology. We show that the DIBL vs. SS relationship for the composite device is an easily accessible indicator for the intrinsic variations observed in a composite device.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Technology - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976318/5984315/05984611.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Technology - Digest of Technical Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of width-quantization-induced variations in logic FinFETs for 22nm and beyond","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FinFETs","Computational modeling","Logic gates","Integrated circuit modeling","Very large scale integration","Semiconductor process modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["width-quantization-induced variation modeling","logic FinFET","continuous width scaling","SRAM","intrinsic variation","composite device","statistical drive current","leakage current distribution","size 22 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of width-quantization-induced variations in logic FinFETs for 22nm and beyond","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192437","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of width-quantization-induced variations in logic FinFETs for 22nm and beyond","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T02A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048657S","chronDate":"14-16 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976318","isNumber":"5984315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976318","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5984315","articleId":"5984611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP (Japan Society of Applied Physi","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984614,"authors":[{"name":"Wanki Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wanki","lastName":"Kim","id":"37961960400"},{"name":"Sung Il Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung Il","lastName":"Park","id":"38276167000"},{"name":"Zhiping Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37963785600"},{"name":"Young Yang-Liauw","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Young","lastName":"Yang-Liauw","id":"38274239000"},{"name":"Deepak Sekar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Sekar","id":"37426882100"},{"name":"H.-S.

The `reverse bias' read operation, applying the positive voltage to the W electrode of asymmetric structure, could much improved the read disturb immunity. It was also confirmed that the ReRAM could be scaled keeping its resistive properties to 28-nm node. Additionally, low switching voltage less than 3 V, low `off' switching current of 25\u03bcA, and high speed read less than 10 nsec were achieved simultaneously. These excellent properties are desirable for the automobile application.","startPage":"50","publicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Technology - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Technology -

The study also shows that device parameter variation is not a significant factor for differentiation between MOSFET and TFET.","publicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Technology - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Technology - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976318/5984315/05984671.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of performance, switching energy and process variations for the TFET and MOSFET in logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984671/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of performance, switching energy and process variations for the TFET and MOSFET in logic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192487","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984671/","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of performance, switching energy and process variations for the TFET and MOSFET in logic","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T06B5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049261S","chronDate":"14-16 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976318","isNumber":"5984315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976318","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5984315","articleId":"5984671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP (Japan Society of Applied Physi","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984680,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Address-Event Representation (AER) is a neuromorphic communication protocol for spiking neurons between different layers. AER bio-inspired image sensors are called \u201cretina\u201d. This kind of sensors measures visual information not based on frames from real life and generates corresponding events. In this paper we provide an alternative, based on cheap FPGA, to these image sensors that takes images provided by an analog video source (video composite signal), digitalizes it and generates AER streams for testing purposes. This design was initially developed for Xilinx Spartan FPGA. In this paper we present a comparison study between synthesis of this design for Xilinx Spartan, Virtex FPGA and Achronix asynchronous FPGA, measuring the maximum performance reached in each case.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984833","startPage":"38","endPage":"45","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976315/5984833/05984845.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer & Telecommunication Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer & Telecommunication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984845/","displayDocTitle":"A perfomance comparison study between synchronous and asynchronous FPGA for spike based systems.

Device-free localization (DFL) systems, such as variance-based radio tomographic imaging (VRTI) use these RSS variations in a wireless network to detect, locate and track people in the area of the network, even through walls. However, intrinsic motion, such as branches moving in the wind, rotating or vibrating machinery, also causes RSS variations which degrade the performance of a DFL system. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a subspace decomposition method subspace variance-based radio tomography (SubVRT) to reduce the impact of the variations caused by intrinsic motion. Experimental results show that the SubVRT algorithm reduces localization root mean squared error (RMSE) by 41%. In addition, the Kalman filter tracking results from SubVRT have 97% of errors less than 1.4 m, a 65% improvement compared to tracking results from VRTI.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984895","startPage":"179","endPage":"187","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984895.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise reduction for variance-based device-free localization and tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Matrix decomposition","Radio frequency","Covariance matrix","Noise","Tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","radio links","radio networks","radio tracking","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise reduction","variance-based device-free localization","variance-based device-free tracking","wireless link","RSS","received signal strength","DFL systems","subspace decomposition method","subspace variance-based radio tomography","SubVRT","root mean squared error","RMSE","Kalman filter tracking","wireless network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Noise reduction for variance-based device-free localization and tracking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189752","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise reduction for variance-based device-free localization and tracking","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p179zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071677S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5984899,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, the delay performance of cognitive radio networks supporting heterogeneous traffic is analyzed. In order to guarantee primary users' (PUs) licensed membership, packets from PUs are distinguished from secondary users (SUs) by employing an absolute priority scheme. Meanwhile, various delay requirements over the packets from SUs are fully considered. The packets from SUs are classified into either delay-sensitive packets or delay-insensitive packets. Moreover, a novel relative priority strategy is designed between these two types of traffic by proposing a \u201ctransmission window\u201d strategy. The delay performance of both a single-PU scenario and a multiple-PU scenario is thoroughly investigated employing queueing theory. In the multiple-PU scenario, a dynamic and adaptive channel selection scheme based on learning automata is developed with the objective of reducing the average delay for all SU packets. Numerical experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the delay performance with respect to varied transmission window sizes. The results in the multiple-PU scenario verify that the proposed learning automata channel selection scheme significantly improves the delay performance of SU packets.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","startPage":"215","endPage":"223","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984901.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay analysis for cognitive radio networks supporting heterogeneous traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984901/","displayDocTitle":"Delay analysis for cognitive radio networks supporting heterogeneous traffic","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180960","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay analysis for cognitive radio networks supporting heterogeneous traffic","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p215zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084545S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5984902,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Shahrasbi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Shahrasbi","id":"37546712500"},{"name":"Nazanin Rahnavard","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Nazanin","lastName":"Rahnavard","id":"37283985300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984902","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Delay","Throughput","Cognitive radio","Receivers","Queueing analysis","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","error correction codes","network coding","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative cognitive radio networks","cooperative relaying","rateless coding error-control mechanism","primary transmitter","primary receiver","cognitive user","queueing theoretical model","relay selection","selective-repeat automatic repeat request","rapid analysis of queueing systems","RAQSsoftware package"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rateless-coding-based cooperative cognitive radio networks: Design and analysis","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984902","startPage":"224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984902","abstract":"The cooperation among the secondary users or among the secondary users and the primary users have proven to bring many benefits to both primary and secondary users in cognitive radio networks.

Our protocols can reduce the time for identifying all the missing tags by up to 75% in comparison to the state of art.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984908","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984908.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast identification of the missing tags in a large RFID system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984908/","displayDocTitle":"Fast identification of the missing tags in a large RFID system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189756","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984908/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast identification of the missing tags in a large RFID system","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p278zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077512S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984917,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjit Kaul","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjit","lastName":"Kaul","id":"37411202900"},{"name":"Marco Gruteser","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Gruteser","id":"37298565800"},{"name":"Vinuth Rai","affiliation":["TOYOTA Info Technology Center Company Limited, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vinuth","lastName":"Rai","id":"37540456600"},{"name":"John Kenney","affiliation":["TOYOTA Info Technology Center Company Limited, CA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Kenney","id":"37547025900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984917","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":247,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3587},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Vehicles","Throughput","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Multiaccess communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","information dissemination","mobile radio","optimisation","radio broadcasting","radio networks","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicular network","wireless broadcast","time critical information","average system information age","optimal operating point","maximum throughput","minimum delay","MAC protocol","throughput optimal value","application layer broadcast rate adaptation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Emerging applications rely on wireless broadcast to disseminate time-critical information. For example, vehicular networks may exchange vehicle position and velocity information to enable safety applications. The number of nodes in one-hop communication range in such networks can be very large, leading to congestion and undesirable levels of packet collisions. Earlier work has examined such broadcasting protocols primarily from a MAC perspective and focused on selective aspects such as packet error rate. In this work, we propose a more comprehensive metric, the average system information age, which captures the requirement of such applications to maintain current state information from all other nearby nodes. We show that information age is minimized at an optimal operating point that lies between the extremes of maximum throughput and minimum delay. Further, while age can be minimized by saturating the MAC and setting the CW size to its throughput-optimal value, the same cannot be achieved without changes in existing hardware. Also, via simulations we show that simple contention window size adaptations like increasing or decreasing the window size are unsuitable for reducing age. This motivates our design of an application-layer broadcast rate adaptation algorithm. It uses local decisions at nodes in the network to adapt their messaging rate to keep the system age to a minimum. Our simulations and experiments with 300 ORBIT nodes show that the algorithm effectively adapts the messaging rates and minimizes the system age.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984917","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984917.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing age of information in vehicular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing age of information in vehicular networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984917/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12180972","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984917/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing age of information in vehicular networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p350kaul.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07333S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5984918,"authors":[{"name":"Tom H.

Although flourishing in Internet, content sharing services are still considered expensive and not ready for mobile users of vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose VTube, an autonomous and cost-effective infrastructure, to facilitate the localized content publish/subscribe in an urban area. VTube relies on the distributed low-cost light-weight storage buffers, namely roadside buffer, installed in the city facilities, such as stores, museums, cafeteria, etc., to cache and publish contents for mobile users. The contents at different storage buffers are then transported to different locations by moving vehicles and cached collaboratively in both vehicles and storage buffers across the city. In this work, we unfold the design of VTube by first presenting the detailed design principles and practices of VTube. Given the content availability and capacity of the buffer storage, we then develop a mathematical model to evaluate the mean download delay of mobile users. Using the delay as an input, we formulate the content replication problem in roadside buffers as a stochastic programming problem to attain the mean system-wide minimum download delay. Finally, we propose a fully distributed random walk based algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate that VTube can minimize the download delay of users because of the exploitation of vehicle mobility and distributed buffer storage at different locations.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984918","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","startPage":"359","endPage":"367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VTube: Towards the media rich city life with autonomous vehicular content distribution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VTube: Towards the media rich city life with autonomous vehicular content distribution","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984918/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180973","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984918/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VTube: Towards the media rich city life with autonomous vehicular content distribution","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p359luan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059332S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984922,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Zheng","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37309977300"},{"name":"John S.

The problem we consider is to maximize throughput in a multihop MIMO network with interference suppression. Our problem formulation accounts for variable rates on the MIMO links, which depend on the channel conditions of the link, and the manner in which the diversity-multiplexing trade-off is handled. We present an ILP formulation of the MIMO one-shot scheduling problem with variable rates, which is the first exact formulation of a MIMO network optimization problem that accounts for full interference suppression capabilities of MIMO links. We use CPLEX to evaluate the optimal solution based on the ILP formulation for wireless networks with up to 32 concurrently transmitting links. We also modify a heuristic algorithm from a related MIMO scheduling problem to work in our problem setting. Results show that the heuristic can scale to networks with 80 or more concurrent links, but is 10-20% from optimal in terms of throughput. We show that the heuristic scheduler is not able to fully exploit the diversity-multiplexing-interference suppression tradeoff, which is inherent in the problem. This shows that there is substantial room for developing improved scheduling algorithms for MIMO networks and provides some insight into promising directions to explore.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984924","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984924.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal one-shot scheduling for MIMO networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984924/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal one-shot scheduling for MIMO networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180977","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984924/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal one-shot scheduling for MIMO networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p404blough.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067426S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5984925,"authors":[{"name":"Tom La Porta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Tom La","lastName":"Porta","id":"37295731600"},{"name":"Chiara Petrioli","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Petrioli","id":"37281757400"},{"name":"Dora Spenza","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy"],"firstName":"Dora","lastName":"Spenza","id":"37947873600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984925","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":430},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor-mission assignment in wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting","abstract":"Sensor mission assignment concerns matching the sensing resources of a wireless sensor network (WSN) to appropriate tasks (missions), which may come to the network dynamically.

In this paper we address this problem by providing both an analytical model and a distributed heuristic, called EN-MASSE, for energy harvesting WSNs. The objective of both model and EN-MASSE is to maximize the profit of the network, fully exploiting the harvesting technologies, while ensuring the execution of the most critical missions within a given target WSN lifetime. The performance of EN-MASSE is evaluated by simulations based on real solar energy traces. Our experiments show that EN-MASSE behaves very closely to the optimum provided by our model and significantly outperforms previously proposed solutions.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","startPage":"413","endPage":"421","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984925.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984925","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supercapacitors","Wireless sensor networks","Energy harvesting","Batteries","Nickel","Sensors","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","sensor placement","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor-mission assignment","wireless sensor network","energy harvesting","sensor mission assignment","battery-operated nodes","analytical model","distributed heuristic","EN-MASSE","solar energy traces"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sensor-mission assignment in wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180978","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984925/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984925/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor-mission assignment in wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p413laporta.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062459S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5984932,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37544192700"},{"name":"Jun Luo","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Luo","id":"37404670700"},{"name":"Athanasios Vasilakos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Vasilakos","id":"37282616800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984932","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":226,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1933},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Encoding","Approximation algorithms","Energy consumption","Polynomials","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","energy conservation","energy consumption","greedy algorithms","integer programming","signal processing","telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed data aggregation","energy efficient wireless sensor network","signal processing","compressed sensing","wireless communication","multihop networking scenarios","network energy consumption","compressed aggregation","optimization problem","NP-completeness","mixed-integer programming formulation","greedy heuristic","energy efficiency","routing aggregation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984932","abstract":"As a burgeoning technique for signal processing, compressed sensing (CS) is being increasingly applied to wireless communications.

We first characterize the optimal solution to this optimization problem, then we prove its NP-completeness. We further propose a mixed-integer programming formulation along with a greedy heuristic, from which both the optimal (for small scale problems) and the near-optimal (for large scale problems) aggregation trees are obtained. Our results validate the efficacy of the greedy heuristics, as well as the great improvement in energy efficiency through our joint routing and aggregation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984932","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984932.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed data aggregation for energy efficient wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed data aggregation for energy efficient wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12189763","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984932/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984932/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed data aggregation for energy efficient wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p46xiang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081859S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984936,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangyu Guan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA","School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Zhangyu","lastName":"Guan","id":"37712370800"},{"name":"Tommaso Melodia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Melodia","id":"37266571400"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984936","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Streaming media","PSNR","Encoding","Interference","Delay","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","convex programming","integer programming","video streaming","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative video streaming","wireless networks","physical-layer cooperation","wireless channel","network-wide performance measure","application-specific performance measure","cooperative networks","video rate control","relay selection","power allocation","mixed-integer nonlinear problem","peak signal-to-noise ratio","asynchronous low-complexity algorithm","distributed low-complexity algorithm","localized low-complexity algorithm","convex optimization","global-optimization centralized algorithm","convex relaxations","nonconvex constraints"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984936","abstract":"Physical-layer cooperation allows leveraging the spatial diversity of the wireless channel without requiring multiple antennas on a single device.

This paper studies cross-layer design techniques for video streaming over cooperative networks. The problem of joint video rate control, relay selection, and power allocation is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem, with the objective of maximizing the sum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of a set of concurrent video sessions. An asynchronous, distributed and localized low-complexity algorithm is designed, based on the iterative solution of convex optimization problems at each individual node. In addition, a global-optimization centralized algorithm based on convex relaxations of non-convex constraints is also proposed as performance benchmark. The distributed algorithm is shown to achieve performance within a few percentage points of the optimal solution. It is also shown that cooperative relaying allows nodes to reduce the overall power consumption without leading to a perceivable decrease in video quality.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984936","startPage":"503","endPage":"511","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984936.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing cooperative video streaming in wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing cooperative video streaming in wireless networks","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984936/","accessionNumber":"12180985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984936/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing cooperative video streaming in wireless networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p503guan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069556S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984938,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37965069800"},{"name":"Baochun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Baochun","lastName":"Li","id":"37280003300"},{"name":"Ben Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Liang","id":"37287338100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984938","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Licenses","Robustness","Economics","Wireless communication","Cost accounting","Color","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local markets","truthful spectrum double auctions","market-driven spectrum auctions","spectrum utilization","District"]}],"abstract":"Market-driven spectrum auctions offer an efficient way to improve spectrum utilization by transferring unused or under-used spectrum from its primary license holder to spectrum-deficient secondary users. Such a spectrum market exhibits strong locality in two aspects: 1) that spectrum is a local resource and can only be traded to users within the license area, and 2) that holders can partition the entire license areas and sell any pieces in the market. We design a spectrum double auction that incorporates such locality in spectrum markets, while keeping the auction economically robust and computationally efficient. Our designs in District are tailored to cases with and without knowledge of bid distributions. An auctioneer can start from one design without any a priori information, and then switch to the other alternative after accumulating sufficient distribution knowledge.

Optimizing these processes is an important step towards maximizing the utilization of current and future networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of CS-RA in heterogeneous wireless networks. Specifically, we propose a distributed cell selection and resource allocation mechanism, in which the CS-RA processes are performed by MSs independently. We formulate the problem as a two-tier game named as inter-cell game and intra-cell game, respectively. In the first tier, i.e. the inter-cell game, MSs select the best cell according to an optimal cell selection strategy derived from the expected payoff. In the second tier, i.e., the intra-cell game, MSs choose the proper radio resource in the serving cell to achieve maximum payoff. We analyze the existence of Nash equilibria of both games, the structure of which suggests the interesting property that we can achieve automatic load balance through the two-tier games. Furthermore, we propose distributed algorithms named as CS-Algorithm and RA-Algorithm to enable the independent MSs converge to Nash equilibria. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms converge effectively to Nash equilibria and that the proposed CS-RA mechanism achieves better performance in terms of throughput and payoff compared to conventional mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984939","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984939.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984939","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","startPage":"530","endPage":"538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A game approach for cell selection and resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A game approach for cell selection and resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984939/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984939/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180988","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game approach for cell selection and resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p530gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086083S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984940,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Ning","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Ning","id":"37535086900"},{"name":"Zhipeng Yang","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538724200"},{"name":"Xiaojuan Xie","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37875254000"},{"name":"Hongyi Wu","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Hongyi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279670400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984940","dbTime":"50 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Incentive schemes","Peer to peer computing","Mobile computing","Games","Routing","Appraisal"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive-aware data dissemination","delay-tolerant mobile network","selfish node","credit-based incentive scheme","nodal collaboration","two-person cooperative game","Nash theorem","data delivery rate"]}],"abstract":"This work centers on data dissemination in delay-tolerant mobile networks, where data fall into a range of interest types and each node may have one or multiple interests. The goal is to deliver data messages from sources to nodes with corresponding interests. We consider selfish nodes with rational behavior, and propose a credit-based incentive scheme to promote nodal collaboration. The key challenge is to effectively track the value of a message under such a unique network setting with intermittent connectivity and multiple interest types. Given poor end-to-end connections, credits are rewarded to the final deliverer only. Thus the value of a message for an intermediate node highly depends on its probability to deliver the message. Such probability itself is nontrivial to estimate. Moreover, a message is usually desired by multiple mobile users. Therefore, it can be potentially \u201csold\u201d multiple times to different receivers. On the other hand, while more than one copies can be created during the transmissions of a message, a particular receiver \u201cpays\u201d for the first received copy only. These characteristics together make the development of incentive mechanism a unique, interesting, and challenging problem. In this paper, we present effective schemes to estimate the expected credit reward, and formulate nodal communication as a two-person cooperative game, whose solution is found by using the Nash Theorem. Extensive simulations are carried out based on real-world traces to evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of data delivery rate, delay and overhead. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates incentive stimulation into data dissemination in delay-tolerant mobile networks with selfish nodes and multiple interest types.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984940","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984940.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","startPage":"539","endPage":"547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive-aware data dissemination in delay-tolerant mobile networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incentive-aware data dissemination in delay-tolerant mobile networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984940/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180989","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5984940/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive-aware data dissemination in delay-tolerant mobile networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p539ning.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080971S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5984946,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Ashok","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Ashok","id":"37426698400"},{"name":"Marco Gruteser","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Gruteser","id":"37298565800"},{"name":"Narayan Mandayam","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Mandayam","id":"37279451600"},{"name":"Taekyoung Kwon","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea","WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Taekyoung","lastName":"Kwon","id":"38182528200"},{"name":"Wenjia Yuan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjia","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37956871200"},{"name":"Michael Varga","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Varga","id":"37969407700"},{"name":"Kristin Dana","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kristin","lastName":"Dana","id":"37265950300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0094-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0092-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"5984946","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","MIMO","Optical transmitters","Multiplexing","Visualization","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","CMOS image sensors","fading channels","MIMO communication","protocols","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual MIMO camera-based communication","parallel data transmission","light emitting arrays","CCD/CMOS camera image sensor","multipath fading","visual MIMO channel","receiver","adaptation algorithm","visual MIMO transmitter","visual MIMO rate adaptation","packet based rate adaptation protocol","rate selection decision","packet error rate feedback","trace-based simulation","vehicle-to-vehicle communication scenario","visibility variation","optical link"]}],"abstract":"We propose a rate adaptation scheme for visual MIMO camera-based communications, wherein parallel data transmissions from light emitting arrays are received by multiple receive elements of a CCD/CMOS camera image sensor. Unlike RF MIMO, multipath fading is negligible in the visual MIMO channel. Instead, the channel is largely dependent on receiver perspective (distance and angle) and visibility issues (partial line-of-sight availability and occlusions). This allows for slower adaptation but requires the adaptation algorithm to choose among a more complex set of modes. In this paper, we define a set of operating modes for visual MIMO transmitters and propose a rate adaptation scheme to switch between these modes. Our Visual MIMO Rate Adaptation (VMRA) is a packet based rate adaptation protocol that bases its rate selection decisions on the packet error rate feedback. Using trace-based simulation results for a vehicle-to-vehicle communication scenario, we illustrate how our VMRA algorithms can adapt over distance as well as visibility variations in an optical link and achieve a higher average throughput.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984946","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984946.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate adaptation in visual MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984946/","displayDocTitle":"Rate adaptation in visual MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12180995","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984946/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate adaptation in visual MIMO","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p583ashok.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159925S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5984951,"authors":[{"name":"Josep Miquel Jornet","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Josep Miquel","lastName":"Jornet","id":"37542780800"},{"name":"Ian F.

Wireless communication among these nanosensors will boost the range of applications of nanotechnology in the biomedical, environmental and military fields, amongst others. Within the different alternatives for communication in the nanoscale, recent advancements in nanomaterials point to the Terahertz band (0.1-10.0 THz) as the frequency range of operation of future electronic nano-devices. This still unlicensed band can theoretically support very large transmission bit-rates in the short range, i.e., for distances below one meter. More importantly, the Terahertz band also enables very simple communication mechanisms suited to the very limited capabilities of nanosensors. In this paper, a new communication paradigm called TS-OOK (Time Spread On-Off Keying) for Electromagnetic Wireless Nanosensor Networks (WNSNs) is presented. This new technique is based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses by following an on-off keying modulation spread in time. The performance of this scheme is assessed in terms of information capacity for the single-user case as well as aggregated network capacity for the multiuser case. The results show that by exploiting the peculiarities of the Terahertz band, this scheme provides a very simple but robust communication technique for WNSNs. Moreover, it is shown that, due to the peculiar behavior of the noise in the Terahertz band, the single-user capacity and the aggregated network capacity can exceed those of the AWGN channel classical wireless networks, when the appropriate channel codes are used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information capacity of pulse-based Wireless Nanosensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984951","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5970760/5984877/05984951.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5984877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5984951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5984951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Information capacity of pulse-based Wireless Nanosensor Networks","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5984951/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12189766","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information capacity of pulse-based Wireless Nanosensor Networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"p80jornet.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10822S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5970760","isNumber":"5984877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5970760","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5984877","articleId":"5984951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5985443,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5044-7426-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5985443","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4034},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Design Automation of the IEEE Computer Society"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","Hardware design languages","Computer languages","Design automation","Formal verification","CADCAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware description languages","IEEE standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["verification language","specification language","2005 Verilog standard","IEEE Std 1364\u2122 2005 Verilog hardware description language","IEEE Std 1800-2005 SystemVerilog unified hardware design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1800-2009","1364-2005","assertions","design automation","design verification","hardware description language","HDL","HDVL","PLI","programming language interface","SystemVerilog","Verilog","VPI"]}],"abstract":"This standard represents a merger of two previous standards: IEEE Std 1364\u2122-2005 Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and IEEE Std 1800-2005 SystemVerilog unified hardware design, specification, and verification language.

One type of equipment that is common in homes and some offices is an electrical, single-stage heat pump air conditioner (AC). To study this setup, we have built the Berkeley Retrofitted and Inexpensive HVAC Testbed for Energy Efficiency (BRITE) platform. This platform allows us to actuate an AC unit that controls the room temperature of a computer laboratory on the Berkeley campus that is actively used by students, while sensors record room temperature and AC energy consumption. We build a mathematical model of the temperature dynamics of the room, and combining this model with statistical methods allows us to compute the heating load due to occupants and equipment using only a single temperature sensor. Next, we implement a control strategy that uses learning-based model-predictive control (MPC) to learn and compensate for the amount of heating due to occupancy as it varies throughout the day and year. Experiments on BRITE show that our techniques result in a 30%-70% reduction in energy consumption as compared to two-position control, while still maintaining a comfortable room temperature. The energy savings are due to our control scheme compensating for varying occupancy, while considering the transient and steady state electrical consumption of the AC. Our techniques can likely be generalized to other HVAC systems while still maintaining these energy saving features.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161242","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6106039/05985456.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"253","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Transient and Steady State Electricity Consumption in HVAC Using Learning-Based Model-Predictive Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Transient and Steady State Electricity Consumption in HVAC Using Learning-Based Model-Predictive Control","volume":"100","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425464","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5985456/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Transient and Steady State Electricity Consumption in HVAC Using Learning-Based Model-Predictive Control","sourcePdf":"jproc-aswani-2161242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085643S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6106039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"6106039","articleId":"5985456","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5985459,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Hemmati","affiliation":["Optical Communications Group, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6046149/5985459/5985459-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamid Hemmati (Senior Member, IEEE) received the M.S. degree from USC and the Ph.D. degree from CSU, both in physics.","He is currently with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, where he is a Principal member of staff and the Supervisor of the Optical Communications Group.

Future perspectives and applications of optical communications related to near-Earth and interplanetary communications are also addressed.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2160609","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6046149/05985459.pdf","startPage":"2020","endPage":"2039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2160609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep-Space Optical Communications: Future Perspectives and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985459","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Deep-Space Optical Communications: Future Perspectives and Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985459/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12300678","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985459/","volume":"99","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep-Space Optical Communications: Future Perspectives and Applications","sourcePdf":"jproc-hemmati-2160609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154598S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6046149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6046149","articleId":"5985459","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5985471,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37384108100"},{"name":"Bin Yu","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University at Albany-State University of New York, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37535092700"},{"name":"M.

The scaling scenarios of the three widely used NW PCM operation schemes (i.e., constant electric field, voltage, and current) are studied and compared.

It is also shown that more than 90% of operation energy is wasted as thermal flux into substrate and electrodes. We predict that, if the wasted thermal flux is effectively reduced by heat confinement technologies, the energy consumed per reset operation can be decreased from about 1 pJ to less than 100 fJ. It is shown that reducing NW aspect ratio helps decreasing PCM energy consumption. It is revealed that cross-cell thermal proximity disturbance is counter intuitively alleviated by scaling, leading to a desirable scaling scenario.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device

Traditionally, forming such matrix requires the intensive computation of Gramians; the proposed method only forms their low-rank Cholesky factors via a novel adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) sampling strategy, leading to significant savings. Unlike some other model reduction methods, balanced truncation POD (BT-POD) is directly applicable to lossy and dispersive electromagnetic models.

Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative operation, which leads to the start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the other hand, underestimation may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance. In this paper, semi-parametric additive models are proposed to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables. Specifically, the inputs for these models are calendar variables, lagged actual demand observations, and historical and forecast temperature traces for one or more sites in the target power system. In addition to point forecasts, prediction intervals are also estimated using a modified bootstrap method suitable for the complex seasonality seen in electricity demand data. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the half-hourly electricity demand for up to seven days ahead for power systems in the Australian National Electricity Market. The performance of the methodology is validated via out-of-sample experiments with real data from the power system, as well as through on-site implementation by the system operator.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2162082","startPage":"134","endPage":"141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/05985500.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2162082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on a Semi-Parametric Additive Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Load modeling","Forecasting","Load forecasting","Electricity","Computational modeling","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","power markets","power system control","power system economics","power system faults","power system planning","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term load forecasting","semiparametric additive model","power system planning","power system operation","power system control","generating capacity dispatch scheduling","reliability analysis","generator maintenance planning","electricity demand overestimation","spinning reserve preparation","power system disturbance","prediction interval estimation","modified bootstrap method","electricity demand data","Australian National Electricity Market"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Additive model","forecast distribution","short-term load forecasting","time series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on a Semi-Parametric Additive Model","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5985500/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12479036","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on a Semi-Parametric Additive Model","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-fan-2162082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102168S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"291","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"5985500","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5985516,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Kumagai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6022820/5985516/5985516-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuki Kumagai received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Graduate School of Engineering.","His research interests are the reliability of the gate insulator of metal\u2013insulator\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors and the process technology for high-quality gate insulators."]},"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Kumagai","id":"37408126200"},{"name":"Akinobu Teramoto","affiliation":["New Industry Creation Hatchery Center, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6022820/5985516/5985516-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Akinobu Teramoto (M'02) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1990, 1992, and 2001, respectively.","During 1992\u20132002, he was with Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Hyogo, Japan, where he has been engaged in research and development of thin silicon dioxide films.

This paper briefly surveys the recent developments for robot vision. Among many factors that affect the performance of a robotic system, Kalman filters have made great contributions to vision perception. Kalman filters solve uncertainties in robot localization, navigation, following, tracking, motion control, estimation and prediction, visual servoing and manipulation, and structure reconstruction from a sequence of images. In the 50th anniversary, we have noticed that more than 20 kinds of Kalman filters have been developed so far. These include extended Kalman filters and unscented Kalman filters. In the last 30 years, about 800 publications have reported the capability of these filters in solving robot vision problems. Such problems encompass a rather wide application area, such as object modeling, robot control, target tracking, surveillance, search, recognition, and assembly, as well as robotic manipulation, localization, mapping, navigation, and exploration. These reports are summarized in this review to enable easy referral to suitable methods for practical solutions. Representative contributions and future research trends are also addressed in an abstract level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985520/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12804818","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5985520/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Kalman Filter for Robot Vision: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman Filter for Robot Vision: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2162714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.222366S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6220909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"301","xplore-issue":"6220909","articleId":"5985520","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":5985521,"authors":[{"name":"M'hamed Drif","affiliation":["Department of Electrotechnics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of Oran, Oran, Algeria","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6058663/5985521/5985521-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["M'hamed Drif (S'08\u2013M'09) was born in Sa\u00efda, Algeria, in 1964.

Simulation results show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed controller design method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2161659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6046172/05985523.pdf","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1153","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2161659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampled-Data Control for Relative Position Holding of Spacecraft Rendezvous With Thrust Nonlinearity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Sampled-Data Control for Relative Position Holding of Spacecraft Rendezvous With Thrust Nonlinearity","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5985523/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12300533","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled-Data Control for Relative Position Holding of Spacecraft Rendezvous With Thrust Nonlinearity","sourcePdf":"tie-gao-2161659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068311S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6046172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6046172","articleId":"5985523","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5985524,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuyoshi Mutoh","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design, Graduate School, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6058663/5985524/5985524-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nobuyoshi Mutoh (M'89\u2013SM'92) completed the first half of the Ph.D. degree in the science and engineering research division, Graduate School, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1975, where he received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 1991.","In April 1975, he was with the Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd.

Dynamic analyses at the time of failure were performed under severe road conditions by comparing the vehicle trajectories of FRID EVs with those of conventional EVs, i.e., two- and four-wheel motor drive-type EVs. The analyzed results show that after failure, FRID EVs continue to run safely and stably; all of the conventional EVs deviate from the travel lane in less than 2 s, which is not sufficient time for an ordinary driver to steer the vehicle to safety after being notified about vehicle failure. Using a prototype FRID EV with practical specifications, failsafe performance at the time of failure was evaluated on test courses, including roads having an ultra-low friction coefficient (\u03bc). The experimental results showed that even if failure occurred while cornering and when running on low- \u03bc roads, the FRID EV continued to run stably. These results proved that FRID EVs could ensure safety at the time of failure under practical running conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2163909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6058663/05985524.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2163909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of Front-and-Rear-Wheel-Independent-Drive-Type Electric Vehicles at the Time of Failure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of Front-and-Rear-Wheel-Independent-Drive-Type Electric Vehicles at the Time of Failure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985524/","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5985524/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12308603","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of Front-and-Rear-Wheel-Independent-Drive-Type Electric Vehicles at the Time of Failure","sourcePdf":"tie-mutoh-2163909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070438S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6058663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6058663","articleId":"5985524","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5985526,"authors":[{"name":"Juan L.

To perform this task using ICPT systems, current solutions require an almost perfect alignment between coils in order to have optimal power transfer. This condition makes necessary a precise positioning maneuver from the driver or an electromechanic alignment system for the secondary winding, causing the process to be slow. This paper shows that it is possible to transfer rated power even with high misalignment if a suitable compensation topology is selected. The performance of the four basic compensation topologies is analyzed, and a series-parallel-series (SPS) topology is proposed, showing a suitable behavior for both the load and the power source. The theoretical results are validated in two series-series and SPS 2-kW prototypes with a 15-cm air gap between coils.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2161055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6046172/05985526.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2161055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Misalignment Tolerant Compensation Topology For ICPT Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"High-Misalignment Tolerant Compensation Topology For ICPT Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985526/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12300534","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985526/","volume":"59","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Misalignment Tolerant Compensation Topology For ICPT Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-sallan-2161055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077529S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6046172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"257","xplore-issue":"6046172","articleId":"5985526","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5985527,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Schuhmann","affiliation":["Business Unit Large Drives, Siemens AG, Nuremberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6046172/5985527/5985527-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Schuhmann received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering from Chemnitz University of Technology (TU Chemnitz), Chemnitz, Germany, in 2005.","From 2005 to 2010, he was a Scientific Assistant with the Department of Electrical Machines and Drives, TU Chemnitz.

Motor performance is evaluated through Fourier analysis and a minimum number of magnetostatic solutions. The major steady-state performance indices (average torque, ripple and cogging torque, back-electromotive-force waveforms, and core losses) are satisfactorily estimated as compared with the results of detailed time-stepping (transient) FEA. In this paper, the CE-FEA method is presented and applied to a parametric design study for an interior-permanent-magnet machine. Significant reduction of simulation times is achieved (approximately two orders of magnitude), permitting a comprehensive search of large design spaces for optimization purposes. In this case study, the influence of three design variables, namely, stator tooth width, pole arc, and slot opening, on three performance indices, namely, average torque, efficiency, and full-load torque ripple, is examined, and design trends are derived. One hundred candidate designs are simulated in less than 20 minutes on a state-of-the-art workstation.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2163912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6146784/05985528.pdf","startPage":"2403","endPage":"2413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2163912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Parametric Design of Permanent-Magnet AC Machines Using Computationally Efficient Finite-Element Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Parametric Design of Permanent-Magnet AC Machines Using Computationally Efficient Finite-Element Analysis","volume":"59","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12801668","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985528/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985528/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Parametric Design of Permanent-Magnet AC Machines Using Computationally Efficient Finite-Element Analysis","sourcePdf":"tie-sizov-2163912-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124412S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6146784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6146784","articleId":"5985528","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5985530,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Salmani","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hassan Salmani (S'10\u2013A'11) received the M.S. degree in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

The added functionality known as hardware Trojan poses major detection and isolation challenges. This paper presents a new hardware trust architecture to magnify functional Trojans activity. Trojan detection resolution depends on Trojan activity directly and circuit activity reversely. The proposed architecture reorders scan cells based on their placement during physical design to reduce circuit switching activity by limiting it into a specific region. This helps magnify Trojan contribution to the total circuit transient power by increasing Trojan-to-circuit switching activity (TCA) and Trojan-to-circuit power consumption (TCP). The proposed technique aims to improve the efficiency of power-based side-channel signal analysis techniques for detecting hardware Trojans. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the method in significantly increasing TCA and TCP.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985530/","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5985530/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12471616","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Layout-Aware Switching Activity Localization to Enhance Hardware Trojan Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout-Aware Switching Activity Localization to Enhance Hardware Trojan Detection","sourcePdf":"tifs-salmani-2164908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100393S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6126189","articleId":"5985530","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5985533,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Berkelman","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6301724/5985533/5985533-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Berkelman (M\u201998) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1992, and the Ph.D. degree in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 1999.","He received Engineering Internships at Philips, Fujitsu, and Toshiba Laboratories.

Position and orientation feedback for closed-loop levitation control is provided by an optical rigid-body motion tracker and wireless LED markers. The actuation model for the levitation system across the full translation and rotation ranges was calculated using electromagnetic finite element analysis and validated with force and torque measurements between a single magnet and coil using motion stages and a six-axis force sensor. The transformation from the set of coil currents to the force and torque generated on the levitated body is recalculated in real time at each update of the levitated platform position and orientation obtained from the motion tracker using a precomputed single magnet and coil actuation model, and redundant kinematic control methods are used to find the least squares set of coil currents to generate the forces and torques needed to stabilize the levitated platform by proportional-derivative feedback control. The approximately 80 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 25 mm translation range of the implemented levitation system is comparable to the dimensions of the levitated magnet platform. The rotation ranges are \u00b140\u00b0 in roll and \u00b115\u00b0 in pitch, with unlimited yaw. The horizontal translation ranges can be extended by adding coils to the array, and the vertical translation and tilt rotation ranges are limited by heat dissipation in the coils. Analysis and control methods of the system are described, and large range translation and rotation trajectory following experimental results are given.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Levitation Over Large Translation and Rotation Ranges in All Directions","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2161614","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6301724/05985533.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2161614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6301724","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Levitation Over Large Translation and Rotation Ranges in All Directions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5985533/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"12982043","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Levitation Over Large Translation and Rotation Ranges in All Directions","sourcePdf":"tmech-berkelman-2161614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092385S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6301724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6301724","articleId":"5985533","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5985535,"authors":[{"name":"Hisataka Maruyama","affiliation":["Department of Micro/Nano Systems Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6006642/5985535/5985535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hisataka Maruyama (M\u201905) received the Doctoral degree in micro/nanomechatronics from Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan, in 2007, where his research was focused on \u201cnoncontact micromanipulation of microtool for on-chip cell measurement system.\u201d","He was then a Research Fellow at Nagoya University until 2008.

However, integration of many sensors in the chip has difficulties such as position and interconnection of sensors. We developed hydrogel microsensors made of photocrosslinkable resin impregnating with indicators for on-chip measurement. This sensor can be used for both area measurement and 3-D sensing by shaping the hydrogel by UV ray patterning. This sensor requires no interconnections since environmental information is detected as optical information such as brightness and color. The YCrCb color space was suitable than the HSV color space in terms of the linearity of the color calibration (H: hue, S: saturation, V: values (brightness). Y : brightness, Cr: color difference of red, Cb: color difference of blue). In this paper, we demonstrated measurement of pH distribution in the microchannel using a color indicator and measurement of oxygen consumption of brown fat cell (BFC) using a fluorescent oxygen indicator. On pH measurement, we used YCrCb color space because Cr and Cb represented monotone variation and robust against brightness fluctuation. The hydrogel was patterned by photolithography into the stripe shape and modified with the indicator. Color change was detected by a color charge-coupled device (CCD). On oxygen measurement, we formed the hydrogel impregnating with the fluorescent indicator into microsphere. Fluorescence change was detected by the spectrophotometer. We succeeded in measuring local pH distribution and oxygen consumption of BFC inside the microfluidic chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6006642/05985535.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"852","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2161878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2161878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photoprocessible Hydrogel Microsensor for Local Environment Measurement on a Microfluidic Chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Semiconductor device measurement","Charge coupled devices","Brightness","Microsensors","Microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge-coupled devices","hydrogels","microfluidics","microsensors","pH measurement","photolithography","spectrophotometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photoprocessible hydrogel microsensor","local environment measurement","microfluidic chip","photocrosslinkable resin","on-chip measurement","area measurement","3D sensing","UV ray patterning","pH distribution","microchannel","color indicator","oxygen consumption","brown fat cell","fluorescent oxygen indicator","pH measurement","photolithography","color charge-coupled device","spectrophotometer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hydrogel","image color analysis","microsensors","photolithography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Photoprocessible Hydrogel Microsensor for Local Environment Measurement on a Microfluidic Chip","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5985535/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12213717","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photoprocessible Hydrogel Microsensor for Local Environment Measurement on a Microfluidic Chip","sourcePdf":"tmech-maruyama-2161878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115769S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6006642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6006642","articleId":"5985535","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5985538,"authors":[{"name":"Anders Fougner","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6086695/5985538/5985538-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anders Fougner (M'10) received the M.Sc. degree from the Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in 2007.

The difference between the constrained nature in which such data are often collected and the unpredictable nature of prosthetic use is an example of the semantic gap between research findings and a viable clinical implementation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the variations in limb position associated with normal use can have a substantial impact on the robustness of EMG pattern recognition, as illustrated by an in- crease in average classification error from 3.8% to 18%. We propose to solve this problem by: 1) collecting EMG data and training the classifier in multiple limb positions and by 2) measuring the limb position with accelerometers. Applying these two methods to data from ten normally limbed subjects, we reduce the average classification error from 18% to 5.7% and 5.0%, respectively. Our study shows how sensor fusion (using EMG and accelerometers) may be an efficient method to mitigate the effect of limb position and improve classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2163529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/6086695/05985538.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2163529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resolving the Limb Position Effect in Myoelectric Pattern Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985538/","displayDocTitle":"Resolving the Limb Position Effect in Myoelectric Pattern Recognition","volume":"19","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12403910","pubMedId":"21846608","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985538/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resolving the Limb Position Effect in Myoelectric Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"tnsre-fougner-2163529-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067504S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6086695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"6086695","articleId":"5985538","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5985541,"authors":[{"name":"Huafeng Xiao","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/5985541/5985541-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huafeng Xiao (S\u201910) was born in Hubei, China, in 1982.

Unfortunately, the shoot-through problem of bridge legs still exists in an NPCTLI, so its operation reliability is degraded. An improved three-level grid-connected inverter is proposed based on the NPCTLI and the dual-buck half-bridge inverter (DBHBI), and which avoids the shoot-through problem. The proposed topology guarantees no switching-frequency common-mode voltage and no shoot-through risk. Furthermore, the freewheeling diode of bridge legs of the DBHBI can be removed taking into consideration the unity power factor of grid current, and a straightforward topology is thus derived. The new topology is referred to as split-inductor NPCTLI (SI-NPCTLI). The operation mode, common-mode characteristic, and control strategy are analyzed. Finally, both the simulation and the experimental results of a 1-kW SI-NPCTLI prototype verify the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/05985541.pdf","startPage":"1799","endPage":"1808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2164940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformerless Split-Inductor Neutral Point Clamped Three-Level PV Grid-Connected Inverter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Leakage current","Bridge circuits","Topology","Leg","Reliability","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","leakage currents","photovoltaic power systems","power apparatus","power factor","power generation reliability","power grids","power inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage current","voltage stress","power device","neutral point clamped three-level inverter","NPCTLI","transformerless photovoltaic grid-connected system","transformerless PV grid-connected system","transformerless split-inductor","bridge leg shoot-through problem","dual-buck half-bridge inverter","DBHBI","switching-frequency common-mode voltage","freewheeling diode","unity power factor","grid current","common-mode characteristic","power 1 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-buck half-bridge inverter (DBHBI)","neutral point clamped three-level inverter (NPCTLI)","photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected inverter","transformerless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Transformerless Split-Inductor Neutral Point Clamped Three-Level PV Grid-Connected Inverter","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5985541/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12556194","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformerless Split-Inductor Neutral Point Clamped Three-Level PV Grid-Connected Inverter","sourcePdf":"tpel-huafeng-2164940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086655S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"5985541","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5985542,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed (M\u201906\u2013SM'11) was born in Cairo, Egypt, on November 25, 1977.

To solve such problems, both the search direction and the step size are two crucial elements in numerical algorithms, such as alternating least squares algorithm (ALS). Owing to the nonlinearity of the problem, the often used linear search direction is not always powerful enough. In this paper, we propose two higher-order search directions. The first one, geometric search direction, is constructed via a combination of two successive linear directions. The second one, algebraic search direction, is constructed via a quadratic approximation of three successive iterates. Then, in an enhanced line search along these directions, the optimal complex step size contains two arguments: modulus and phase. A current strategy is ELSCS that finds these two arguments alternately. So it may suffer from a local optimum. We broach a direct method, which determines these two arguments simultaneously, so as to obtain the global optimum. Finally, numerical comparisons on various search direction and step size schemes are reported in the context of blind separation-equalization of convolutive DS-CDMA mixtures. The results show that the new search directions have greatly improve the efficiency of ALS and the new step size strategy is competitive.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2164911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/05985548.pdf","startPage":"5888","endPage":"5898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2164911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New ALS Methods With Extrapolating Search Directions and Optimal Step Size for Complex-Valued Tensor Decompositions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"New ALS Methods With Extrapolating Search Directions and Optimal Step Size for Complex-Valued Tensor Decompositions","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985548/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358008","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New ALS Methods With Extrapolating Search Directions and Optimal Step Size for Complex-Valued Tensor Decompositions","sourcePdf":"tsp-han-2164911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09337S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"5985548","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5985549,"authors":[{"name":"Kaibin Huang","affiliation":["Yonsei University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/5985549/5985549-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaibin Huang (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.Eng.

The deployment of this technique requires channel-state information (CSI) feedback from each receiver to all interferers, resulting in substantial network overhead. To address this issue, this paper proposes the method of distributive control that intelligently allocates CSI bits over multiple feedback links and adapts feedback to channel dynamics. For symmetric channel distributions, it is optimal for each receiver to equally allocate the average sum-feedback rate for different feedback links, thereby decoupling their control. Using the criterion of minimum sum-interference power, the optimal feedback-control policy is shown using stochastic-optimization theory to exhibit opportunism. Specifically, a specific feedback link is turned on only when the corresponding transmit-CSI error is significant or interference-channel gain is large, and the optimal number of feedback bits increases with this gain. For high mobility and considering the sphere-cap-quantized-CSI model, the optimal feedback-control policy is shown to perform water-filling in time, where the number of feedback bits increases logarithmically with the corresponding interference-channel gain. Furthermore, we consider asymmetric channel distributions with heterogeneous path losses and high mobility, and prove the existence of a unique optimal policy for jointly controlling multiple feedback links. Given the sphere-cap-quantized-CSI model, this policy is shown to perform water-filling over feedback links. Finally, simulation demonstrates that feedback-control yields significant throughput gains compared with the conventional differential-feedback method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2165063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","startPage":"6112","endPage":"6126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/05985549.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Control of Event-Driven Feedback in Multiantenna Interference Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5985549/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Control of Event-Driven Feedback in Multiantenna Interference Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358009","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Control of Event-Driven Feedback in Multiantenna Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2165063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121997S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"5985549","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5985552,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Huemer","affiliation":["Institute of Networked an Embedded Systems, Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/5985552/5985552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mario Huemer (S'97\u2013M'99\u2013SM'07) was born in Wels, Austria, in 1970.

However, it is crucial to minimize relay self-interference to render full duplex feasible. For this purpose, we analyze a broad range of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mitigation schemes: natural isolation, time-domain cancellation, and spatial suppression. Cancellation subtracts replicated interference signal from the relay input while suppression reserves spatial dimensions for receive and transmit filtering. Spatial suppression can be achieved by antenna subset selection, null-space projection, i.e., receiving and transmitting in orthogonal subspaces, or joint transmit and receive beam selection to support more spatial streams by choosing the minimum eigenmodes for overlapping subspaces. In addition, minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering can be employed to maintain the desired signal quality, which is inherent for cancellation, and the combination of time- and spatial-domain processing may be better than either alone. Targeting at minimal interference power, we solve optimal filters for each scheme in the cases of joint, separate and independent design. The performance of mitigation schemes is evaluated and compared by simulations. The results confirm that self-interference can be mitigated effectively also in the presence of imperfect side information.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2164910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2164910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/05985554.pdf","startPage":"5983","endPage":"5993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of Loopback Self-Interference in Full-Duplex MIMO Relays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of Loopback Self-Interference in Full-Duplex MIMO Relays","volume":"59","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985554/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985554/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of Loopback Self-Interference in Full-Duplex MIMO Relays","sourcePdf":"tsp-riihonen-2164910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.269715S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"735","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"5985554","onlineDate":"15 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5985608,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Seok Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun-Seok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37089128166"},{"name":"Dae-Keun Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae-Keun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37088923232"},{"name":"Jong-Tae Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Tae","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292425200"},{"name":"Byung-Ju Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Ju","lastName":"Yi","id":"37273970700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8115-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8113-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8114-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"CD","value":"2152-7431"}],"articleNumber":"5985608","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"abstract":"Most lamp units at ceilings, walls, and streets are static and no automatic motion capabilities are available at all to adjust lamp tilting angles and its zooming position.

Keeping the robustness of HOG features on human detection, we raise the process speed in detection and tracking so that it can be used for real-time applications. These advantages are given by a simple process which needs just one linear-SVM classifier with HOG features and Gaussian-PSO procedure for the both of detection and tracking.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2011.5985610","startPage":"483","endPage":"488","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978849/5985607/05985610.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2011.5985610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDAT: Simultaneous detection and tracking of humans using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Feature extraction","Histograms","Tracking","Particle filters","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","object detection","object tracking","particle swarm optimisation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDAT","simultaneous detection and tracking","human detection","dynamic behavior","unpredictable behavior","Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization","histograms of oriented gradients","robustness","linear-SVM classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human Detection","Human Tracking","Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG)","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Gaussian-PSO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SDAT: Simultaneous detection and tracking of humans using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985610/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12194532","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SDAT: Simultaneous detection and tracking of humans using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"icma2011085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05346S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978849","isNumber":"5985607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978849","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5985607","articleId":"5985610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5985647,"authors":[{"name":"Chayooth Theeravithayangkura","affiliation":["Division of System Innovations, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Chayooth","lastName":"Theeravithayangkura","id":"37394026000"},{"name":"Tomohito Takubo","affiliation":["Division of System Innovations, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohito","lastName":"Takubo","id":"37273926000"},{"name":"Kenichi Ohara","affiliation":["Division of System Innovations, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Ohara","id":"37280511400"},{"name":"Yasushi Mae","affiliation":["Division of System Innovations, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Mae","id":"37281355800"},{"name":"Tatsuo Arai","affiliation":["Division of System Innovations, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuo","lastName":"Arai","id":"37281360800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8115-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8113-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8114-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"CD","value":"2152-7431"}],"articleNumber":"5985647","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic rotational walking motion on inclined-plane with posture optimization by genetic algorithms","abstract":"New inclined-plane motion for limb mechanism robot ASTERISK's dynamic rotational walking motion is designed.

technology. As a critical part of AFM system, the piezoelectric scanner exists many defects such as hysteresis, creep, and ease of vibration effects, which has become a bottleneck in its further development and application. In this paper, an image-based method by using polar coordinate is presented to model the piezoelectric scanner utilized in AFM, which can effectively avoid the troubles of data acquisition in AFM system. The parameters of its inverse model are identified by the Least-square method(LSM) and an inverse feedforward control strategy is developed. To verify the performance of this strategy, Being CSPM5500 AFM has been employed, the analysis and performance evaluation have been conducted in detail, which demonstrates that the novel hysteresis model and the image-based inverse feedforward control strategy presented in this paper possess a good performance for AFM nano imaging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5985654/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12194573","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hysteresis modeling and inverse feedforward control of an AFM piezoelectric scanner based on nano images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hysteresis modeling and inverse feedforward control of an AFM piezoelectric scanner based on nano images","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"icma2011034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062894S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978849","isNumber":"5985607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978849","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5985607","articleId":"5985654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5985655,"authors":[{"name":"Weibin Rong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Weibin","lastName":"Rong","id":"38337550500"},{"name":"Shizhong Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Shizhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37961351300"},{"name":"Miao Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37959171400"},{"name":"Lining Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Lining","lastName":"Sun","id":"37273265800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8115-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8113-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8114-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"CD","value":"2152-7431"}],"articleNumber":"5985655","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Friction","Nanopositioning","Nanowires","Scanning electron microscopy","Force","Probes","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["friction","manipulator dynamics","micromanipulators","nanopositioning","nanotechnology","nanowires","piezoelectric transducers","scanning electron microscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D stick-slip nanopositioner","nanomanipulation","scanning electron microscope","PZT linear dynamics","nonlinear friction","stick-slip stage","nanowire manipulation","piezoelectric transducers","slider-rod friction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nanopositioner","stick-slip","friction modeling","nanomanipulation"]}],"abstract":"A compact nanopositioner which consists of three stick-slip inertial stages was designed and built particularly for nanomanipulation inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

Accurate estimation of the echoes parameters is important in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE). Model based method is often used to estimate ultrasonic echo signals, which models ultrasonic backscattered signal as superimposed Gaussian echoes corrupted by noise. This method requires good initial guesses for parameters and may get the local minima in the error function search space, instead of the global the minimum. To overcome the shortcomings, this research uses genetic algorithm (GA) to improve the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The improved algorithm using GA doesn't need doing the initial guessing work manually, and can even acquire the estimation result directly. Simulation tests were carried out to validate the algorithm, which proved the effectiveness of the method.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2011.5985731","startPage":"613","endPage":"617","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2011.5985731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985607","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978849/5985607/05985731.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic echoes estimation method using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985731/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic echoes estimation method using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985731/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12194650","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic echoes estimation method using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"icma2011107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050988S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978849","isNumber":"5985607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978849","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5985607","articleId":"5985731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5985747,"authors":[{"name":"Xiufen Ye","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Xiufen","lastName":"Ye","id":"37288428300"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539332600"},{"name":"Tian Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37961775300"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37962624600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8115-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8113-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8114-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"CD","value":"2152-7431"}],"articleNumber":"5985747","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":171},"abstract":"This paper proposes a new multiphase level set model.

Storage is a major computational resource that may be leased under the cloud computing approach. An economical model is provided for the analysis of the Buy-or-Lease decision for storage in cloud computing. The model introduces a probabilistic approach to evaluate future prices and the replacement needs for disk arrays (in contrast to the current literature which considers deterministic prices and fixed replacement rates).

A widely adopted solution to make robust a microprocessor-based system consists in modifying the software application by adding redundancy and fault detection capabilities. The efficiency of the selected software-based solution must be assessed. This evaluation process allows the designers to choose the more suitable robustness technique and check if the hardened system achieves the expected dependability levels. Several approaches with this purpose can be found in the literature, but their efficiency is limited in terms of the number of faults that can be injected, as well as the level of accuracy of the fault injection process. In this paper, we propose FPGA-based fault injection techniques to evaluate software robustness methods under Single Event Upset (SEU) as well as Single Event Transient (SET). Experimental results illustrate the benefits of using the proposed fault injection method, which is able to evaluate a high amount of faults of both types of events.","doi":"10.1109/LATW.2011.5985918","publicationTitle":"2011 12th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978853/5985882/05985918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATW.2011.5985918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985882","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using an FPGA-based fault injection technique to evaluate software robustness under SEEs: A case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using an FPGA-based fault injection technique to evaluate software robustness under SEEs: A case study","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 March 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985918/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 March 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12206967","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5985918/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using an FPGA-based fault injection technique to evaluate software robustness under SEEs: A case study","confLoc":"Beach of Porto de Galinhas, Brazil","sourcePdf":"latw1139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069405S","chronDate":"27-30 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978853","isNumber":"5985882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978853","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5985882","articleId":"5985918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5985926,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Therefore, there is an increasing need for on-chip aging monitoring. This paper presents a programmable aging sensor that can be embedded in FPGA-based designs, using standard resources available in those devices. The sensing principle is to monitor performance degradation over time. Depending on whether dynamic or static aging effects are dominant, the sensor can operate continuously or be only activated at some time intervals. Given the reduced amount of resources required by the sensor, it can be instantiated not only in the critical paths of a circuit, but also in those that may be identified to be more likely affected by aging affects. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed sensor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmable sensor for on-line checking of signal integrity in FPGA-based systems subject to aging effects","doi":"10.1109/LATW.2011.5985926","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATW.2011.5985926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985882","publicationTitle":"2011 12th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978853/5985882/05985926.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Programmable sensor for on-line checking of signal integrity in FPGA-based systems subject to aging effects","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5985926/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12206975","conferenceDate":"27-30 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmable sensor for on-line checking of signal integrity in FPGA-based systems subject to aging effects","confLoc":"Beach of Porto de Galinhas, Brazil","sourcePdf":"latw1152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06437S","chronDate":"27-30 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978853","isNumber":"5985882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978853","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5985882","articleId":"5985926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5985932,"authors":[{"name":"Cesare Ferri","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Cesare","lastName":"Ferri","id":"38343240000"},{"name":"Dimitra Papagiannopoulou","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitra","lastName":"Papagiannopoulou","id":"38559011800"},{"name":"R.

In particular, the reliability impact of pMOS negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has become a serious concern. Recent works have shown how conventional leakage optimization techniques can help mitigate NBTI-induced aging effects on cache memories. In this paper we focus specifically on scratchpad memory (SPM) and present novel software approaches as a means of alleviating the NBTI-induced aging effects.

In this scenario, new defects generated during the manufacturing process have become important and challenging concerns for Nano-Scale Static Random Memories' (SRAMs') testing. Thus, functional fault models, traditionally applied in SRAMs' testing, have become insufficient to correctly reproduce the effects caused by these defects. In more detail, new memory technologies have introduced new defects that cause dynamic faults, a previously unknown type of fault. In parallel, the rapidly increasing need to store more information results in the fact that the memory elements occupy great part of the System-on-Chip (SoC) silicon area. Therefore, memories have become the main responsible for the overall SoC yield. In this context, we propose a new Built-In Current Sensor (BICS) scheme to detect dynamic faults associated to resistive-open defects in SRAMs. Experimental results obtained throughout electrical simulation demonstrate the BICS's fault detection capability. Finally, we lay out the benefits and limitations of the BICS's adoption and point out the direction of future works.","publicationTitle":"2011 12th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978853/5985882/05985934.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new Built-In Current Sensor scheme to detect dynamic faults in Nano-Scale SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/LATW.2011.5985934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATW.2011.5985934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5985934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5985934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"A new Built-In Current Sensor scheme to detect dynamic faults in Nano-Scale SRAMs","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12206983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5985934/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new Built-In Current Sensor scheme to detect dynamic faults in Nano-Scale SRAMs","confLoc":"Beach of Porto de Galinhas, Brazil","sourcePdf":"latw1161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057688S","chronDate":"27-30 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978853","isNumber":"5985882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978853","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5985882","articleId":"5985934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5985936,"authors":[{"name":"G.

While the switch-off technique was already proposed for energy conservation, the switch-on approach is a new paradigm which is based purely on one-time implementations of dynamic circuit capability. Our results show that both approaches can significantly reduce the power consumption and decrease the necessary totally installed capacity, but unlike the switch-off scheme, the switch-on scheme does not affect the path redundancy in the network. Furthermore, switch-on can reduce the number of routing reconfigurations required in the network. While this seems ideal, our results also show that the switch-on scheme uses a large number of small capacity interfaces which may not be suitable from a network planning perspective as it might require frequent capacity upgrades, which alone is an interesting avenue for future research.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976787/5985993/05986006.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To switch on or off: A simple case study on energy efficiency in IP-over-WDM networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Switches","Routing","Switching circuits","Topology","Network topology","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","Internet","IP networks","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication network routing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","IP-over-WDM networks","switch-off","energy conservation","dynamic circuit capability","switch-off scheme","switch-on scheme","routing reconfigurations","network planning","Internet based services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"To switch on or off: A simple case study on energy efficiency in IP-over-WDM networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986006/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12193918","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To switch on or off: A simple case study on energy efficiency in IP-over-WDM networks","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"p70caria.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055925S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976787","isNumber":"5985993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976787","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5985993","articleId":"5986006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5986008,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, OCDMA systems may suffer from Multiple Access Interference (MAI) and other kinds of noise when many users access the shared media simultaneously, increasing the BER (Bit Error Rate) to unacceptable levels, that is, a situation at which all combined signals interfere and are lost. This work proposes a mixed OCDMA and Tunable Transmitter-Fixed Receiver (TT-FR) WDM and ring architecture at which the ring is split into small-size segments to limit the probability of MAI. Essentially, every segment in the ring has got two hub nodes (on the segment's head and tail) which forwards inter-segment traffic to other hub nodes on dedicated home wavelengths, thus making use of WDM. The access media inside the segment is shared between the nodes by means of OCDMA, and code reuse is possible on different segments. Our performance analysis shows how to split a given ring into segments in order to minimise the BER due to multiple users accessing the network and allow for high bit-rates for a given traffic load. In addition, we analyse the possibility of introducing Forward Error Correction (FEC) at a moderate overhead cost to improve performance.","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986008","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976787/5985993/05986008.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985993","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of a hybrid OCDMA-WDM segmented ring for metropolitan area networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study of a hybrid OCDMA-WDM segmented ring for metropolitan area networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986008/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12193920","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986008/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of a hybrid OCDMA-WDM segmented ring for metropolitan area networks","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"p83rodriguezdelossantos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063199S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976787","isNumber":"5985993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976787","xplore-issue":"5985993","articleId":"5986008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5986037,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Chicha","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Chicha","id":"37946204300"},{"name":"Luka Milinkovic","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Luka","lastName":"Milinkovic","id":"37943994400"},{"name":"Aleksandra Smiljanic","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Smiljanic","id":"37332833700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8456-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8454-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8455-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-5552"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-5560"}],"articleNumber":"5986037","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"abstract":"The pool of available IPv4 addresses is being depleted, comprising less than 10% of all IPv4 addresses.

The RHNN scheduler determines an optimal set of neurons (I/O paths) to be enabled, achieving maximal system throughput and priority differentiation subject to the switch- and buffer-contention-free constraints. The RHNN is specially structured with ranked neurons. With each neuron being associated with an input/output path within WOPIS, the RHNN allows higher-rank neurons (higher-priority and/or lower-delay paths) to disable lower-rank neurons that were enabled during previous iterations. Ranking the neurons unfortunately gives rise to a convergence problem. We present two theorems that supply the sufficient conditions for the RHNN scheduler to converge to the optimal solution. We demonstrate via simulation results that, with the computation time of less than one system time slot, the RHNN scheduler achieves near 100% throughput and multi-level prioritized scheduling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal

In this paper, we analyze the performance of localization of wireless mobiles with the knowledge of signal sampling theory. We propose a general approach of locating a wireless mobile device using a directional antenna, and we prove that the correctness of localization depends on the setting of the signal sampling rate. We derived a set of theorems to judge the time cost of localization in order to achieve a certain degree of accuracy. These theorems cover different types of directional antennas for signal strength sampling so that we can utilize them to enhance the positioning accuracy. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our theory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986162","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976314/5986116/05986162.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On sampling signal strength for localization using a directional antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"On sampling signal strength for localization using a directional antenna","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192283","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986162/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On sampling signal strength for localization using a directional antenna","confLoc":"Lucca","sourcePdf":"DSPANChen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060502S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5986169,"authors":[{"name":"Tamara Bonaci","affiliation":["Network Security Laboratory (NSL), University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Bonaci","id":"37847542600"},{"name":"Phillip Lee","affiliation":["Network Security Laboratory (NSL), University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Phillip","lastName":"Lee","id":"37958810900"},{"name":"Linda Bushnell","affiliation":["Networked Control System Laboratory (NCS), Electrical Engineering Department, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Bushnell","id":"38571451900"},{"name":"Radha Poovendran","affiliation":["Network Security Laboratory (NSL), University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Radha","lastName":"Poovendran","id":"37276692700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0351-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0352-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0350-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5986169","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloning","Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Optimization","Convex functions","Detection algorithms","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","optimisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed clone detection","wireless sensor networks","optimization approach","distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed detection methods","linear dynamical model","optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study distributed algorithms for detecting cloned nodes in wireless sensor networks.

The new streaming technique is based on the 3GPP and partly also on the Open IPTV Forum (OIPF) specifications. In this paper, we give an overview about the new DASH specification with a special focus on Live streaming services. In order to re-use existing web content distribution schemes, the new streaming technique provides the live stream as a sequence of files, which are continuously downloaded by the streaming client. This way of streaming introduces new delay components into the system streaming. Live Streaming technology is often used for events like sport events to allow other users to virtually participate. It is generally preferred to minimize the end-to-end delay for live services. In the paper, we identify and analyze the different delay components of the new adaptive HTTP streaming technique and how they contribute to the end-to-end delay of live services. We also discuss the dependencies and system implications when minimizing the end to end delay. The evaluation principles are also applicable for other adaptive HTTP streaming formats.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986186","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986186","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976314/5986116/05986186.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic adaptive HTTP streaming of live content","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic adaptive HTTP streaming of live content","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192306","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986186/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic adaptive HTTP streaming of live content","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"INDUSTRYLohmar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047728S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5986220,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The classic write-back scheme overcame a half-select problem and improved a yield; however, the conventional scheme consumed more power due to charging and discharging all write bitlines (WBLs) in a sub block. Our proposed scheme consists of a floating bitline technique and a low-swing bitline driver (LSBD). This scheme decreases active leakage and active power by 33% and 32% at the FF corner, respectively. In other process corners, more active power reduction can be expected. We fabricated a 512-Kb 8T SRAM test chip that operates at a single 0.5-V supply voltage. The proposed scheme achieves 8.8-\u03bcW/MHz active energy in a write cycle and 72.8-\u03bcW leakage power, which are 35% and 26% better than the conventional write-back scheme. The total energy is 20.1 \u03bcW/MHz at 0.5 V in a 50%-read/50%-write operation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985982","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Circuits - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Symposium on VLSI Circuits - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976946/5985982/05986220.pdf","startPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 40-nm 0.5-V 20.1-\u00b5W/MHz 8T SRAM with low-energy disturb mitigation scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986220/","displayDocTitle":"A 40-nm 0.5-V 20.1-\u00b5W/MHz 8T SRAM with low-energy disturb mitigation scheme","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12194453","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986220/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40-nm 0.5-V 20.1-\u00b5W/MHz 8T SRAM with low-energy disturb mitigation scheme","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"C072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043518S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976946","isNumber":"5985982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976946","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5985982","articleId":"5986220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP (Japan Society of Applied Physi","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5986221,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Fan Chang","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Fan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37420875800"},{"name":"Wei-Cheng Wu","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Cheng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37351014600"},{"name":"Chih-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["ITRI, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Sheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404178100"},{"name":"Pi-Feng Chiu","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pi-Feng","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37533596000"},{"name":"Ming-Bin Chen","affiliation":["ITRI, Taiwan","National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539629100"},{"name":"Yen-Huei Chen","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Huei","lastName":"Chen","id":"38185516600"},{"name":"Hsin-Chi Lai","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Chi","lastName":"Lai","id":"37088683520"},{"name":"Zhe-Hui Lin","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhe-Hui","lastName":"Lin","id":"37961648700"},{"name":"Shyh-Shyuan Sheu","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Shyuan","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37410797200"},{"name":"Tzu-Kun Ku","affiliation":["National Tsinghua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Kun","lastName":"Ku","id":"37362009800"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Yamauchi","affiliation":["Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37307813600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-175-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-86348-166-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5636"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5601"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-5601"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-5601"}],"articleNumber":"5986221","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":882},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Random access memory","Arrays","Very large scale integration","Sorting","Scalability","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM chips","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stacked layer number scalable TSV","high performance universal-memory-capacity 3D IC platform","TSV-based die-to-die bonding stacked-layer-number-scalable 3D SRAM macro","semi-master-slave structure","self-timed differential-TSV signal transfer","constant-load logic-SRAM interface","TSV-induced power","speed overhead","die-to-die variation","pre-bonding KGD sorting","universal-memory-capacity platform","layer-scalable test-mode","via-last process"]}],"abstract":"This work demonstrates the first fabricated TSV-based die-to-die bonding stacked-layer-number-scalable 3D-SRAM macro.

Numerous approaches have been presented for path planning of mobile robots. One of the most efficient methods is Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN). This paper presents a novel approach we call the Sparsed Potential PCNN method for real time path planning for mobile robots. In the proposed method a Potential Field approach is used to limit the propagation of the autowave only in the direction of the destination rather than propagating in all directions. This increases the efficiency of the PCNN algorithm. Furthermore a sparsing technique is applied to make the algorithm even more time efficient. The algorithm has proven to be a robust and time efficient path planning scheme. The Sparsed Potential-PCNN plans the shortest path in the shortest possible time. The algorithm is also capable of avoiding obstacles in its path. Simulation results in Player/Stage for Pioneer 3 AT mobile robot navigating among obstacles in an indoor environment are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978849/5985607/05986339.pdf","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsed potential-PCNN for real time path planning and indoor navigation scheme for mobile robots","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2011.5986339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2011.5986339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sparsed potential-PCNN for real time path planning and indoor navigation scheme for mobile robots","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12194926","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986339/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsed potential-PCNN for real time path planning and indoor navigation scheme for mobile robots","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"icma2011301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064281S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978849","isNumber":"5985607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978849","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5985607","articleId":"5986339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5986354,"authors":[{"name":"Hongchi Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Electric Drive, Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongchi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37963567800"},{"name":"Xiaoxin Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Electric Drive, Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281389200"},{"name":"Shutian Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Electric Drive, Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shutian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37277712200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8115-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8113-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8114-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"CD","value":"2152-7431"}],"articleNumber":"5986354","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"abstract":"The VME bus is a widely used industrial bus, which is applied in military, industrial, aerospace, communication and control applications.

radio (CR) ad hoc networks are composed of wireless nodes that may opportunistically transmit in licensed frequency bands without affecting the primary users of that band. In such distributed networks, gathering the spectrum information is challenging as the nodes have a partial view of the spectrum environment based on the local sensing range. Moreover, individual measurements are also affected by channel uncertainties and location-specific fluctuations in signal strength. To facilitate the distributed operation, this paper makes the following contributions: (i) First, an experimental study is undertaken to measure the signal characteristics for indoor and outdoor locations for the TV channels 21 - 51, and these results are used to identify the conditions under which nodes may share information. (ii) Second, a Cooperative reinforcement LearnIng scheme for Cognitive radio networKs (CLICK) is designed for combining the spectrum usage information observed by a node and its neighbors. (iii) Finally, CLICK is integrated within a MAC protocol for testing the benefits and overhead of our approach on a higher layer protocol performance. The proposed learning framework and the protocol design are extensively evaluated through a thorough simulation study in ns-2 using experimental traces of channel measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12192339","htmlLink":"/document/5986378/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation and communication in Cognitive radio networks based on TV spectrum experiments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation and communication in Cognitive radio networks based on TV spectrum experiments","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"REGULARDiFelice.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06041S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5986384,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Gramaglia","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Gramaglia","id":"37704209200"},{"name":"Pablo Serrano","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Serrano","id":"37298488800"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Alberto Hern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Alberto","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez","id":"37411896900"},{"name":"Maria Calderon","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Calderon","id":"37326418300"},{"name":"Carlos J.

The analysis of the distance between vehicles in roads is a key factor in, e.g., designing vehicular networks protocols or planning a supporting infrastructure to improve vehicular connectivity. This work proposes a Gaussian-exponential mixture model to characterize the time distance between vehicles in a highway lane, based on measurements collected at different locations in several highways of the city of Madrid, in Spain. The model arises from the observed behavior that some vehicles travel very close together, like in a burst mode, showing Gaussian inter-arrival times, while other vehicles are somehow isolated, showing exponentially distributed inter-arrival times. The experiments show that such a Gaussian-exponential mixture model accurately characterizes inter-vehicle times observed from real traces.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976314/5986116/05986384.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New insights from the analysis of free flow vehicular traffic in highways","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Road transportation","Random variables","Correlation","Extraterrestrial measurements","Analytical models","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","mobile radio","protocols","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free flow vehicular traffic analysis","route planning","vehicular network protocols","Gaussian-exponential mixture model","Gaussian interarrival times"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"New insights from the analysis of free flow vehicular traffic in highways","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986384/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192345","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New insights from the analysis of free flow vehicular traffic in highways","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"REGULARGramaglia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12639S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5986390,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Khattab","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Khattab","id":"37284161500"},{"name":"Dmitri Perkins","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Perkins","id":"37666904400"},{"name":"Magdy A.

Consequently, optimizing the constrained cognitive radio network performance based only on local interference measurements at cognitive senders does not lead to truly optimal performance due to hidden and exposed primary senders. In this paper, we present the rate-adaptive probabilistic medium access protocol (RAP-MAC) for opportunistic spectrum management. In contrast to existing techniques, our approach addresses the unavoidable inaccuracy in spectrum sensing via a probabilistic spectrum access strategy. Furthermore, RAP-MAC allows multiple cognitive flows to fairly share the available bandwidth without explicit coordination by adopting a non-greedy transmission approach that prevents a single cognitive transmitter from monopolizing an available spectral opportunity. We analytically formulate the cognitive user performance optimization problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming to derive the optimal parameter values. Packet-level simulations show that RAP-MAC achieves between 65% to 119.5% higher goodput with significantly better fairness characteristics compared to existing greedy approaches that overlook the spectrum sensing limitations.","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986390","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976314/5986116/05986390.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986390","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-adaptive probabilistic spectrum management for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rate-adaptive probabilistic spectrum management for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986390/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986390/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192351","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-adaptive probabilistic spectrum management for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"REGULARKhattab.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070563S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5986399,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Takahashi","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37961403900"},{"name":"Hiroki Ui","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Ui","id":"37088682884"},{"name":"Nozomu Takatori","affiliation":["Sony LSI Design Incorporated, Isahaya, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Nozomu","lastName":"Takatori","id":"37088682910"},{"name":"Shingo Sanada","affiliation":["Sony LSI Design Incorporated, Isahaya, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37088682570"},{"name":"Takeshige Hamamoto","affiliation":["Sony LSI Design Incorporated, Isahaya, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshige","lastName":"Hamamoto","id":"37088682763"},{"name":"Hideo Nakayama","affiliation":["Sony LSI Design Incorporated, Isahaya, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Nakayama","id":"37088682587"},{"name":"Yusuke Moriyama","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Moriyama","id":"37951895000"},{"name":"Miho Akahide","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Miho","lastName":"Akahide","id":"37088682581"},{"name":"Takahisa Ueno","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahisa","lastName":"Ueno","id":"37449727500"},{"name":"Noriyuki Fukushima","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Fukushima","id":"37969154400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-175-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-86348-166-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5636"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5601"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-5601"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-5601"}],"articleNumber":"5986399","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Decoding","CMOS image sensors","Clocks","Noise","Timing","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","image convertors","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital CDS scheme","column-inline TDC architecture","APS-C format CMOS image sensor","correlate double sampling","time to digital converter","column-parallel TDC","delay line interpolation","A/D conversion","CMOS technology","word length 12 bit","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TDC","CMOS image sensor","column-parallel architecture","correlate double sampling (CDS)"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a digital correlate double sampling (CDS) scheme which is suitable for a column-inline time to digital converter (TDC).

This role is even more crucial in a cognitive radio mesh network operating in a densely populated urban area where the environment is dynamic due to the erratic nature of spectrum availability and spectrum diversity. In this work, a probability distribution called ArgMax is proposed, which can be used as the transitional probability distribution in probabilistic routing and selective protocols. A probabilistic selection routing procedure (PSRP) is also proposed that adopts ArgMax probability distribution to guide packets throughout the network. We have compared the performance of PSRP using ArgMax with PSRP incorporating the well-known and frequently used distribution Odds-On-Mean (OOM) in evaluating its transitional probability distribution. OOM is the distribution that is used in many MAC and routing protocols that select the next node probabilistically. The simulation result suggests that ArgMax enables the routing scheme to adapt to the network dynamic more quickly, and locates the best candidate to route to, more accurately. Hence, the network throughput increased and the end-to-end delay improved.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986116","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976314/5986116/05986462.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On transitional probabilistic routing in cognitive radio mesh networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986462/","displayDocTitle":"On transitional probabilistic routing in cognitive radio mesh networks","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192358","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On transitional probabilistic routing in cognitive radio mesh networks","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"REGULARSoltani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105319S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5986466,"authors":[{"name":"John Whitbeck","affiliation":["UPMC Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, Paris, France"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Whitbeck","id":"37317785400"},{"name":"Marcelo Amorim","affiliation":["UPMC Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Amorim","id":"37948478000"},{"name":"Yoann Lopez","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"Yoann","lastName":"Lopez","id":"37941518600"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Leguay","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","lastName":"Leguay","id":"37295737600"},{"name":"Vania Conan","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"Vania","lastName":"Conan","id":"37295735900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0351-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0352-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0350-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5986466","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":516},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Argon","Mobile communication","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless infrastructure","guaranteed delays","opportunistic networks","network capacity","3G-enabled devices","ad hoc radio connectivity","push-and-track hybrid connectivity","content dissemination framework","control loop","user-sent acknowledgements","3G interface","short delay-tolerance","road traffic updates","large-scale vehicular dataset","3G network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986466","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986116","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976314/5986116/05986466.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relieving the wireless infrastructure: When opportunistic networks meet guaranteed delays","abstract":"Major wireless operators are nowadays facing network capacity issues in striving to meet the growing demands of mobile users. At the same time, 3G-enabled devices increasingly benefit from ad hoc radio connectivity (e.g., Wi-Fi). In this context of hybrid connectivity, we propose Push-and-track, a content dissemination framework that harnesses ad hoc communication opportunities to minimize the load on the wireless infrastructure while guaranteeing tight delivery delays. It achieves this through a control loop that collects user-sent acknowledgements to determine if new copies need to be reinjected into the network through the 3G interface. Push-and-Track includes multiple strategies to determine how many copies of the content should be injected, when, and to whom. The short delay-tolerance of common content, such as news or road traffic updates, make them suitable for such a system. Based on a realistic large-scale vehicular dataset from the city of Bologna composed of more than 10,000 vehicles, we demonstrate that Push-and-Track consistently meets its delivery objectives while reducing the use of the 3G network by over 90%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986466/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192362","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Relieving the wireless infrastructure: When opportunistic networks meet guaranteed delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relieving the wireless infrastructure: When opportunistic networks meet guaranteed delays","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"REGULARWhitbeck.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064752S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5986490,"authors":[{"name":"Dang Nguyen","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Dang","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38184288900"},{"name":"Pascale Minet","affiliation":["INRIA, Rocquencourt, France"],"firstName":"Pascale","lastName":"Minet","id":"37275211700"},{"name":"Thomas Kunz","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kunz","id":"37265016900"},{"name":"Louise Lamont","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Louise","lastName":"Lamont","id":"38523800500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0351-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0352-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0350-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5986490","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986490","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Mobile computing","Clustering algorithms","Approximation methods","Network topology","Approximation algorithms","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","mobile ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc networks","MANET","cluster head selection algorithms","distance-constrained selection","size-constrained selection","NP-hard","NS-2 simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986490","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976314/5986116/05986490.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New findings on the complexity of cluster head selection algorithms","abstract":"Clustering schemes offer a practical way of providing scalability when dealing with large and dense Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). The feasibility of clustering can be determined by the complexity of the cluster head selection. Optimizing the cluster head selection allows for the network to be more efficient by minimizing the signaling overhead while ensuring that the network connectivity is maintained despite topology changes. In this paper, we present some new findings on the complexity of the cluster head selection algorithms. Two variants of the cluster head selection are examined: (1) the distance-constrained selection where every node in the network must be located within a certain distance to the nearest cluster head; and (2) the size-constrained selection where each cluster is only allowed to have a limited number of members. We show that the problem of minimizing the set of cluster heads is NP-hard for both variants. We propose two distributed selection algorithms, each having logarithmic approximation ratio, for these variants. We also discuss, using NS-2 simulations, the resulting cluster size distribution and cluster head density, which impact the efficient operation of the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986490/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12192385","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986490/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"New findings on the complexity of cluster head selection algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New findings on the complexity of cluster head selection algorithms","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"REGULARNguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086732S","chronDate":"20-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976314","isNumber":"5986116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976314","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5986116","articleId":"5986490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5986497,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Sandstrom","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/85/5986492/5986497/5986497-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Sandstr\u00f6m is a postdoctoral researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.

A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is presented to handle facility location and production capacity selection as well as choice of transportation mode for ASCN design (ASCND) problem. Due to the complexity of the optimization problem, a hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is proposed. To facilitate finding optimal binary decision variables, a reduced variable neighborhood local search is embedded into PSO to enhance the explorability. Given binary variables, LINGO is adapted to solve the linear programming problem derived from the MIP. Case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid PSO approach. The computational results of case study show that hybrid PSO is superior to original binary PSO for ASCND problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986548/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12206442","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986548/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid particle swarm optimization approach for design of agri-food supply chain network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid particle swarm optimization approach for design of agri-food supply chain network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071823S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975308","isNumber":"5986517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975308","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5986517","articleId":"5986548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5986575,"authors":[{"name":"Minmin Qiu","affiliation":["IBM Research China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Minmin","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37533101700"},{"name":"Dingding Lin","affiliation":["IBM Research China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dingding","lastName":"Lin","id":"37955027500"},{"name":"Yongqing Xue","affiliation":["IBM Research China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongqing","lastName":"Xue","id":"37946117300"},{"name":"Hongwei Ding","affiliation":["IBM Research China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Ding","id":"37291040000"},{"name":"Jin Dong","affiliation":["IBM Research China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Dong","id":"37286534700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0574-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0573-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0572-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5986575","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Software","Synchronization","Industries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["goods distribution","logistics","scheduling","service industries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event driven monitoring","event driven scheduling","logistics industry","e-commerce","telemarketing","TV home shopping","express companies","event driven shipment monitoring","shipment lifecycle","dynamic routing","service quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["event monitoring","logistics scheduling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven monitoring and scheduling in express and logistics industry","abstract":"Express delivery industry is growing rapidly as the result of an explosive growth in the e-commerce, telemarketing and TV home-shopping, especially in developing countries.

Wireless Mesh Network(WMN) based on 802.16 provides a new solution idea for the wireless broadband coverage of the railway, which is based on OFDM technology to support high-bandwidth data transmission in high-speed mobile environment. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the key technology of physical layer of WMN which has strong anti-interference ability, high bandwidth utilization and transmission rate. But there are some problems such as synchronization, channel estimation and Peak to Average Power Ratio(PAPR). Among these problems, synchronization is the most important one. For the classic Schmidl&Cox (S&C) timing synchronization algorithm existing plateau which leads to the synchronization inaccuracy, other improved algorithms are proposed to get better performance. However, drawbacks including the narrow synchronization range and the high computational complexity still exist. The optimized scheme mainly contains two aspects, one is amending the structure of the training sequence, and the other is improving the correlation algorithm. Above all, a new method is presented in this paper that optimizes the structure of the training sequence and improves the correlation algorithm to enhance the performance and support the high-speed mobile trains.","doi":"10.1109/SOLI.2011.5986596","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations, Logistics and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations, Logistics and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975308/5986517/05986596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOLI.2011.5986596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986517","startPage":"419","endPage":"422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new OFDM symbol synchronization for WMN used in railway","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new OFDM symbol synchronization for WMN used in railway","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986596/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12206490","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new OFDM symbol synchronization for WMN used in railway","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046983S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975308","isNumber":"5986517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975308","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5986517","articleId":"5986596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5986664,"authors":[{"name":"Keang-Po Ho","affiliation":["Silicon Image, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Keang-Po Ho (S'91\u2013M'95\u2013SM'03) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1991, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1993 and 1995, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He was involved in research at IBM T.

An MMF is in the strong-coupling regime when the total length of the MMF is much greater than the correlation length over which local principal modes can be considered constant. In this regime, the GDs can be described as the eigenvalues of zero-trace Gaussian unitary ensemble, and the probability density function (pdf) of the GDs is the eigenvalue distribution of the ensemble. For fibers with two to seven modes, the marginal pdf of the GDs is derived analytically. For fibers with a large number of modes, this pdf is shown to approach a semicircle distribution. In the strong-coupling regime, the delay spread is proportional to the square root of the number of independent sections, or the square root of the overall fiber length.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistics of Group Delays in Multimode Fiber With Strong Mode Coupling","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2165316","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6045636/05986664.pdf","startPage":"3119","endPage":"3128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2165316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2011","displayDocTitle":"Statistics of Group Delays in Multimode Fiber With Strong Mode Coupling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"21","htmlLink":"/document/5986664/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"12300686","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistics of Group Delays in Multimode Fiber With Strong Mode Coupling","sourcePdf":"jlt-ho-2165316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084279S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6045636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"6045636","articleId":"5986664","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986679,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Tao Duan","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan-Tao","lastName":"Duan","id":"37409266700"},{"name":"Bin Chen","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292996400"},{"name":"Hai-Lin Chen","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hai-Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293463900"},{"name":"Da-Gang Fang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Da-Gang","lastName":"Fang","id":"37272944600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5986679","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Boundary conditions","Time domain analysis","Sparse matrices","Mathematical model","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","finite difference time-domain analysis","rectangular waveguides","sparse matrices","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PML","perfectly matched layer","absorbing boundary condition","efficient","2D WLP FDTD method","two dimensional finite difference time domain method","weighted Laguerre polynomials","perturbation term","sparse matrix equation","factorization splitting scheme","2D rectangular conductor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","Laguerre polynomials","perfectly matched layer (PML)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, Berenger's perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition is presented for the efficient two-dimensional (2-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with weighted Laguerre polynomials.

The aim of the research with PP is to try out mechanisms for learning, intelligence and consciousness. Limitations of resources have dictated that the experiments with PP are made on a personal computer by simulating the brain and robot body in a microworld. The unique features of PP are multiple context and novelty-seeking. In this paper, a squash-pop microworld is described first, so that concrete examples can be given for a brief review of the PP system, followed by two new features called trail memory, to realize Baars' global workspace, and belief memory, to realize Rosenthal's higher order thoughts and Johnson-Laird's conscious reasoning. The extended system, PP*, is designed to give consciousness to the subconscious PP, but higher order thoughts and conscious reasoning prove to be elusive. A definition of a conscious robot provides a measure of progress.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986693/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12408993","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Multiple Context Brain for Experiments With Robot Consciousness","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiple Context Brain for Experiments With Robot Consciousness","sourcePdf":"tamd-andreae-2164404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076168S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"6097099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6097099","articleId":"5986693","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5986694,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Fu","affiliation":["Fetch Technologies, El Segundo, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6125258/5986694/5986694-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Fu received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000, the M.S. degree from the University of Rhode Island, Providence, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2008, all in electrical and computer engineering.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a Staff Scientist with Broadcom Corporation, where he designed and developed Broadcom's first speech recognizer for Bluetooth and cell phone chips.

For most pattern recognition problems, the \u201cerror\u201d is conventionally assumed to be binary, i.e., 0 or 1, equivalent to error counting, independent of the specifics of the error made by the system. The term \u201cerror rate\u201d is thus long considered the prevalent system performance measure. This performance measure, nonetheless, may not be satisfactory in many practical applications. In automatic speech recognition, for example, it is well known that some errors are more detrimental (e.g., more likely to lead to misunderstanding of the spoken sentence) than others. In this paper, we propose an extended framework for the speech recognition problem with non-uniform classification/recognition error cost which can be controlled by the system designer. In particular, we address the issue of system model optimization when the cost of a recognition error is class dependent. We formulate the problem in the framework of the minimum classification error (MCE) method, after appropriate generalization to integrate the class-dependent error cost into one consistent objective function for optimization. We present a variety of training scenarios for automatic speech recognition under this extended framework. Experimental results for continuous speech recognition are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12444008","htmlLink":"/document/5986694/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Speech Recognition Based on Non-Uniform Error Criteria","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Speech Recognition Based on Non-Uniform Error Criteria","sourcePdf":"tasl-fu-2165279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073769S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"5986694","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986698,"authors":[{"name":"Hee-Dong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6022820/5986698/5986698-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hee-Dong Kim was born in Mungyeong, Korea, in 1983.

It is shown that a meaningful improvement of AASR can be attained at a small cost of raised RASR level, as compared with the performance of single-input multiple-output SAR.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6155684/05986700.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"910","endPage":"932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on the Processing Scheme for Space\u2013Time Waveform Encoding SAR System Based on Two-Dimensional Digital Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Study on the Processing Scheme for Space\u2013Time Waveform Encoding SAR System Based on Two-Dimensional Digital Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986700/","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5986700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556248","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on the Processing Scheme for Space\u2013Time Waveform Encoding SAR System Based on Two-Dimensional Digital Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tgrs-feng-2162097-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074572S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6155684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6155684","articleId":"5986700","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5986703,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Rodriguez","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico SantaMar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6032192/5986703/5986703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jose Rodriguez (M'81\u2013SM'94\u2013F'10) received the Engineer degree in electrical engineering from Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Valpara\u00edso, Chile, in 1977 and the Dr.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany, in 1985.","Since 1977, he has been with the Department of Electronics Engineering, UTFSM, where he is currently a Full Professor and a Rector.

A discrete-time model of the converter, the input filter, and the load is used to predict the behavior of the instantaneous input reactive power and the output currents for each valid switching state. The control scheme selects the state that minimizes the value of a cost function in order to generate input currents with unity power factor and output currents with a low error with respect to a reference. The active damping method is based on a virtual harmonic resistor which damps the filter resonance.

While the CS literature has mostly focused on problems involving 1-D signals and 2-D images, many important applications involve multidimensional signals; the construction of sparsifying bases and measurement systems for such signals is complicated by their higher dimensionality. In this paper, we propose the use of Kronecker product matrices in CS for two purposes. First, such matrices can act as sparsifying bases that jointly model the structure present in all of the signal dimensions. Second, such matrices can represent the measurement protocols used in distributed settings.

However, in reality, this assumption is often violated due to the presence of multiple light sources. In this paper, we will address more realistic scenarios where the uniform light-source assumption is too restrictive. First, a methodology is proposed to extend existing algorithms by applying color constancy locally to image patches, rather than globally to the entire image. After local (patch-based) illuminant estimation, these estimates are combined into more robust estimations, and a local correction is applied based on a modified diagonal model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on spectral and real images show that the proposed methodology reduces the influence of two light sources simultaneously present in one scene. If the chromatic difference between these two illuminants is more than 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n , the proposed framework outperforms algorithms based on the uniform light-source assumption (with error-reduction up to approximately 30%).

Fusion functions are objectively optimized to model expression and illumination variations in linear subspaces for invariant face recognition. Parameters of adjacent functions are constrained to smoothly vary for effective numerical regularization. In addition to spatial optimization, multiple nonlinear fusion models are combined to enhance their learning capabilities. Experiments on the FRGC v2 data set show that spatial optimization, higher order fusion functions, and the combination of multiple such functions systematically improve performance, which is, for the first time, higher than score-level fusion in a similar experimental setup.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6129825/05986710.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2165218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2165218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Optimized Data-Level Fusion of Texture and Shape for Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Face recognition","Shape","Lighting","Feature extraction","Biometrics (access control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image texture","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially optimized data-level fusion","human face recognition","3D shape","3D texture","illumination variations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-level fusion","low-level fusion","multimodal biometrics","3-D face recognition"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biometric Identification","Databases, Factual","Discriminant Analysis","Face","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Principal Component Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Optimized Data-Level Fusion of Texture and Shape for Face Recognition","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5986710/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12472216","pubMedId":"21859625","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Optimized Data-Level Fusion of Texture and Shape for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-mian-2165218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135666S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"5986710","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986711,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwei Guo","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6129825/5986711/5986711-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiwei Guo received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in information and communication engineering from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2005 and in 2007, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He studied at Queen Mary, University of London, London, U.K., from 2008 to 2010.

Two empirical risk functions are studied, namely, the square loss and \u03b5-insensitive loss functions. The former leads to higher rank tensor ridge regression (TRR), and the latter leads to higher rank support tensor regression (STR), both formulated using the Frobenius norm for regularization. We also use the group-sparsity norm for regularization, favoring in that way the low rank decomposition of the tensorial weight. In that way, we achieve the automatic selection of the rank during the learning process and obtain the optimal-rank TRR and STR. Experiments conducted for the problems of head-pose, human-age, and 3-D body-pose estimations using real data from publicly available databases, verified not only the superiority of tensors over their vector counterparts but also the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2165291","startPage":"816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6129825/05986711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2165291","endPage":"827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor Learning for Regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Tensor Learning for Regression","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5986711/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12472217","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","pubMedId":"21859620","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor Learning for Regression","sourcePdf":"tip-patras-2165291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175662S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"5986711","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986714,"authors":[{"name":"Xuesong Mao","affiliation":["Optical Device and System Laboratory, Information and Electronics Systems Division, Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Mao","id":"38237821100"},{"name":"Daisuke Inoue","affiliation":["Optical Device and System Laboratory, Information and Electronics Systems Division, Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37435489000"},{"name":"Satoru Kato","affiliation":["Optical Device and System Laboratory, Information and Electronics Systems Division, Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Kato","id":"37857114000"},{"name":"Manabu Kagami","affiliation":["Optical Device and System Laboratory, Information and Electronics Systems Division, Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Manabu","lastName":"Kagami","id":"37324788600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1524-9050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0016"}],"articleNumber":"5986714","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1990},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","url":"http://sites.ieee.org/itss/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Doppler effect","Doppler radar","Frequency modulation","Measurement by laser beam"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","Doppler radar","laser ranging","optical modulation","optical radar","velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude-modulated laser radar scheme","speed measurement","range measurement","car application","Doppler laser radar","time-of-flight range finders","car environment","in-car laser radar system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","Doppler laser radar","heterodyne","range finder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986714","abstract":"Doppler laser radar can improve the precision of speed measurement by about two orders of magnitude compared with time-of-flight range finders, which obtain target speeds by range differentiation.

The limitations of these schemes to their employment in car applications are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2162627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2162627","startPage":"408","endPage":"413","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6157683/05986714.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude-Modulated Laser Radar for Range and Speed Measurement in Car Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude-Modulated Laser Radar for Range and Speed Measurement in Car Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986714/","accessionNumber":"12557739","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986714/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude-Modulated Laser Radar for Range and Speed Measurement in Car Applications","sourcePdf":"tits-mao-2162627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042462S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6157683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6157683","articleId":"5986714","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5986725,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A variable inductance is used to control and regulate the dc output voltage maintaining constant switching frequency for the half-bridge transistors. The output voltage characteristics of the series resonant and parallel resonant converters under the proposed magnetic control are obtained and analyzed. In order to evaluate the proposed technique, a laboratory prototype for a 48 V-input 5 V/10 A-output 500 kHz parallel resonant converter is presented. A methodology for obtaining the converter dynamic response using a step response test is carried out. From the dynamic response, a compensator for operating the converter at closed loop is developed and tested in the laboratory. The results prove that the proposed technique is suitable for controling resonant inverters at constant frequency using a low-cost half-bridge inverter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Experimentation on Constant-Frequency DC-DC Resonant Converters With Magnetic Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2165083","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/05986725.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2165083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Experimentation on Constant-Frequency DC-DC Resonant Converters With Magnetic Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5986725/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524213","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Design, and Experimentation on Constant-Frequency DC-DC Resonant Converters With Magnetic Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-alonso-2165083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077503S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"5986725","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5986726,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The applied analysis methodology relies on accurate device models for circuit simulations, where the power MOSFETs are central due to their primary relevance to power losses. The method is referred to as virtual design loop and aims at optimizing the overall system performance with minimum empirical efforts. This is successfully applied to the development of a power MOSFET technology offering outstanding dynamic and static performance characteristics in the application. From a system perspective, the limits of power density conversion will be explored for this and other emerging technologies that promise to open up a new paradigm in power integration capabilities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/05986728.pdf","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2165343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2165343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power MOSFET Technology Roadmap Toward High Power Density Voltage Regulators for Next-Generation Computer Processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Load modeling","Power MOSFET","Performance evaluation","Semiconductor device measurement","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","power convertors","power MOSFET","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power MOSFET technology roadmap","high power density voltage regulator topology","next-generation computer processors","synchronous buck converter based multiphase architecture","circuit simulations","power losses","virtual design loop","power density conversion","power integration capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit simulation","device modeling","hard switching","high switching frequency","multiphase architectures","power MOSFETs","synchronous buck converter","technology roadmap","voltage regulators (VRs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power MOSFET Technology Roadmap Toward High Power Density Voltage Regulators for Next-Generation Computer Processors","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5986728/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543541","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power MOSFET Technology Roadmap Toward High Power Density Voltage Regulators for Next-Generation Computer Processors","sourcePdf":"tpel-lopez-2165343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070582S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"5986728","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986729,"authors":[{"name":"Liqin Ni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Liqin Ni (M\u201907) received the B.S. degree from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, China, in 2003, and M.S. degree from Dalian University of Technology, China, in 2005, both in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in 2010.

The converter is connected between the ultracapacitor (UC) pack and the battery pack in a multisource energy storage system of a hybrid vehicle. Typically, multiphase interleaved converters require a current control loop in each phase to avoid imbalanced current between phases. This increases system cost and control complexity. In this paper, in order to minimize imbalance currents and remove the current control loop in each phase, the converter is designed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The high current ripple associated with DCM operation is then alleviated by interleaving. The design, construction, and testing of an experimental hardware prototype is presented, with the test results included. Finally, a novel soft switch topology for DCM operation is proposed for future research, to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS), or zero-current switching (ZCS) in all transitions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2165297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","startPage":"1141","endPage":"1151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/05986729.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Power Current Sensorless Bidirectional 16-Phase Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Hybrid Vehicle Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986729/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"High Power Current Sensorless Bidirectional 16-Phase Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Hybrid Vehicle Application","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524214","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Power Current Sensorless Bidirectional 16-Phase Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Hybrid Vehicle Application","sourcePdf":"tpel-ni-2165297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070715S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"5986729","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5986731,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuang Xu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6144184/5986731/5986731-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhuang Xu received the M.Eng.Sci. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 1999 and 2006, respectively.","From 2001 to 2005, he was with the Energy System Group, University of New South Wales.

In this paper, the switch duty cycle and the phase angle of the interleaved converters are employed as two control freedoms to achieve decoupled voltage regulation within a certain operating range among different ports, which is referred to as pulsewidth modulation plus phase angle shift (PPAS) control scheme. An interleaved bidirectional buck-boost converter and a full-bridge converter are integrated together to derive a combined three-port dc/dc converter for photovoltaic (PV)-battery hybrid energy systems, which is adopted as a typical example to explore the clear performance of the proposed PPAS control strategy. The bidirectional buck-boost converter and the full-bridge converter share the same power MOSFETs in the primary side, which simplifies the circuit structure and improves the power density. The duty cycle of the interleaved bidirectional buck-boost converter is adopted to realize the maximum power point tracking and the voltage balance between the battery and the PV cell in the primary side. Furthermore, the phase angle of the interleaved buck-boost converter is employed as another control freedom to achieve accurate secondary output voltage regulation. Finally, a 100-W PV-Battery energy system is designed and tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2163826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6144184/05986732.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2163826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144184","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PWM Plus Phase Angle Shift (PPAS) Control Scheme for Combined Multiport DC/DC Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PWM Plus Phase Angle Shift (PPAS) Control Scheme for Combined Multiport DC/DC Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12524217","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5986732/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PWM Plus Phase Angle Shift (PPAS) Control Scheme for Combined Multiport DC/DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhao-2163826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086029S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6144184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6144184","articleId":"5986732","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986739,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Xu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6094076/5986739/5986739-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunfei Xu (S'09\u2013M'11) received the M.S. and B.S. degrees in automotive engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

Nonparametric Gaussian process regression that is based on truncated observations is proposed for mobile sensor networks with limited memory and computational power. We first provide a theoretical foundation of Gaussian process regression with truncated observations. In particular, we demonstrate that prediction using all observations can be well approximated by prediction using truncated observations under certain conditions. Inspired by the analysis, we then propose a centralized navigation strategy for mobile sensor networks to move in order to reduce prediction error variances at points of interest. For the case in which each agent has a limited communication range, we propose a distributed navigation strategy.

It requires, among others, that the interference generated by the CRN is well controlled. In this paper we address this problem for a particular type of interference constraints, in which the aggregated powers of the interference generated by the unlicensed network are required not to exceed certain thresholds. Traditional distributed \u201cwater filling\u201d based spectrum allocation schemes are not well equipped to enforce such interference constraints. A natural extension to these algorithms involves penalizing each unlicensed user with a set of time-varying prices based upon its contribution to the total interference. In this context, the network is in equilibrium if: i) all interference constraints are satisfied; and ii) no unlicensed user has an incentive to alter its own transmission power levels. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to compute such equilibrium in two distinctive network configurations: 1) the unlicensed users are mobile devices that communicate with a common access point; 2) the unlicensed users are transceiver pairs. We show that our algorithm converges to a set of equilibria in the first scenario without restriction on the channel gains, and it converges to an equilibrium point in the second scenario under a relatively mild condition related to the channel gains.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986744/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12358015","volume":"59","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Equilibrium Pricing of Interference in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equilibrium Pricing of Interference in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-hong-2165059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105881S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"5986744","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5986746,"authors":[{"name":"Aifei Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/5986746/5986746-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aifei Liu was born in Rizhao, Shandong, China, in October 1983.

Under some mild assumptions, we propose a new DOA estimation method based on the eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix which is constructed by the dot product of the array output vector and its conjugate. By combining the new DOA estimation with the conventional gain-phase error estimation, a method is proposed to simultaneously estimate the DOA and gain-phase errors without joint iteration. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method performs independently of phase errors and thus behaves well regardless of phase errors. However, the resolution capability of the proposed method is lower than that of the method in [A. J. Weiss and B. Friedlander, \u201cEigenstructure methods for direction finding with sensor gain and phase uncertainties,\u201d Circuits Systems Signal Process., vol. 9, no. 3, pp. 271-300, 1990], named as the WF method. In order to improve the resolution capability and maintain phase error independence, a combined strategy is developed using the proposed and WF methods. The advantage of the proposed methods is that they are independent of phase errors, leading to the cancellation of phase error calibration during the operation life of an array. Moreover, the proposed methods avoid the problem of suboptimal convergence which occurs in the WF method. The drawbacks of the proposed methods are their high computational complexity and their requirement for the condition that at least two signals are spatially far from each other, and they are not applicable to a linear array. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2165064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/05986746.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2165064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","startPage":"5944","endPage":"5956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Eigenstructure Method for Estimating DOA and Sensor Gain-Phase Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Eigenstructure Method for Estimating DOA and Sensor Gain-Phase Errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358017","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986746/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Eigenstructure Method for Estimating DOA and Sensor Gain-Phase Errors","sourcePdf":"tsp-liao-2165064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091551S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"5986746","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986747,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Mastronarde","affiliation":["State University of New York, Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA","University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Mastronarde","id":"37294970400"},{"name":"Mihaela van der Schaar","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"van der Schaar","id":"37285114700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5986747","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2210},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Markov processes","Delay","Heuristic algorithms","Multimedia communication","Learning","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","radiocommunication","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast reinforcement learning algorithm","energy-efficient wireless communication","energy-efficient point-to-point transmission","delay-sensitive data","fading channel","physical-layer","system-level techniques","energy consumption","delay constraints","Markov decision process","channel statistics","traffic arrival","system-level power management strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-efficient wireless multimedia communication","dynamic power management","power-control","adaptive modulation and coding","Markov decision process","reinforcement learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/05986747.pdf","startPage":"6262","endPage":"6266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2165211","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2165211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Wireless Communication","abstract":"We consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission of delay-sensitive data (e.g., multimedia data) over a fading channel.

We show that, through connections with the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, jointly optimizing power and beamformers in the max-min weighted SINR problem can be solved optimally in a distributed fashion. Then, connecting these three performance objectives through the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality and nonnegative matrix theory, we solve the weighted sum MSE minimization and the weighted sum rate maximization in the weak interference regimes using fast algorithms. In the general case, we first establish optimality conditions to the weighted sum MSE minimization and the weighted sum rate maximization problems and provide their further connection to the max-min weighted SINR problem. We then propose a distributed weighted proportional SINR algorithm that leverages our fast max-min weighted SINR algorithm to solve for local optimal solution of the two nonconvex problems, and give conditions under which global optimality is achieved.

In this paper, we focus on the throughput maximization of spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks and propose a novel cognitive radio system that significantly improves their achievable throughput. More specifically, we introduce a novel receiver and frame structure for spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks and study the problem of deriving the optimal power allocation strategy that maximizes the ergodic capacity of the proposed cognitive radio system under average transmit and interference power constraints. In addition, we study the outage capacity of the proposed cognitive radio system under various constraints that include average transmit and interference power constraints, and peak interference power constraints. Finally, we provide simulation results, in order to demonstrate the improved ergodic and outage throughput achieved by the proposed cognitive radio system compared to conventional spectrum sharing cognitive radio systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the Capacity of Spectrum Sharing Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2165306","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/05986755.pdf","startPage":"3768","endPage":"3779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2165306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986755/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Capacity of Spectrum Sharing Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5986755/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291110","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Capacity of Spectrum Sharing Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-stotas-2165306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06158S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5986755","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986756,"authors":[{"name":"Masatoshi Uno","affiliation":["Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan AeroSpace Exploration Agency, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6045674/5986756/5986756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masatoshi Uno (M'06) was born in Japan in 1979.

Various equalization techniques have been developed for diminishing such imbalances. However, since the number of switches, sensors, and/or multiwinding transformers present in conventional equalizers is directly proportional to the number of series connections of the cells, the circuit complexity and cost of the equalizers are prone to increase with the number of series connections. In this paper, single-switch cell voltage equalizers using multistacked buck-boost converters, such as the single-ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC), Zeta, and \u0106uk converters, are proposed. These equalizers consist of passive components and a single switch, significantly reducing the complexity of the circuit when compared with that of conventional equalizers. In addition, when the proposed equalizers operate in discontinuous conduction mode, feedback control is not required to limit currents flowing through cells and circuit components. The proposed equalizers are compared with conventional topologies in terms of the number of active and passive components required. Operating analyses were conducted under both cell-voltage-balanced and -imbalanced conditions. Experimental equalization tests were performed for four series-connected SCs using the SEPIC-based single-switch equalizer. The energies of the series-connected SCs were preferentially redistributed by the equalizer to the cell(s) having the lowest voltage, resulting in the elimination of the cell voltage imbalance and subsequent uniformity of the cell voltages.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/05986756.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2165229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2165229","startPage":"3635","endPage":"3645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Switch Cell Voltage Equalizer Using Multistacked Buck-Boost Converters Operating in Discontinuous Conduction Mode for Series-Connected Energy Storage Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986756/","displayDocTitle":"Single-Switch Cell Voltage Equalizer Using Multistacked Buck-Boost Converters Operating in Discontinuous Conduction Mode for Series-Connected Energy Storage Cells","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986756/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"12291111","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Switch Cell Voltage Equalizer Using Multistacked Buck-Boost Converters Operating in Discontinuous Conduction Mode for Series-Connected Energy Storage Cells","sourcePdf":"tvt-uno-2165229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076267S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5986756","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5986757,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Balankutty","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6031177/5986757/5986757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ajay Balankutty (S'01) received the B.Tech. degree in electronic and communication engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2010.","From 2001 to 2005, he was with Analog Devices, Inc., Bangalore, India.

This control can handle large loads or unbalanced loads with minimized cross interference between channels. A constant-charge-auto-hopping (CCAH) control is also presented to further extend the power handling capacity of the regulator with a predictable system switching noise spectrum. The switching frequency of the converter can be automatically hopped between 1 MHz and 1 MHz/N where N = 2 to 7 according to the total loads and during load transient. To minimize cross-regulation during frequency hopping, the inductor peak current is set to a predefined value according to the switching frequency information from the frequency detection unit to deliver a constant charge per switching period to the unchanged outputs. The response of the transient output is also enhanced with this inductor peak current prediction method. A prototype has been fabricated with a 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process to verify the effectiveness of the CCAH control. With 1.8 V-2.4 V input voltage, two regulated output voltages between 3.0 V and 3.6 V, with maximum 400 mA to 600 mA driving capability and maximum power efficiency of 91.6% is achieved at total output power of 1.15 W. Load transient measurements show that the worst-case cross-regulation is 0.033 mV/mA with a 300 mA load current change at output A and 0.0714 mV/mA with a 280 mA load current change at output B. No noticeable cross-regulation can be observed with a less than 200 mA load current change.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2162188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6031177/05986759.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2162188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6031177","startPage":"2350","endPage":"2362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wide-Load-Range Constant-Charge-Auto-Hopping Control Single-Inductor-Dual-Output Boost Regulator With Minimized Cross-Regulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Wide-Load-Range Constant-Charge-Auto-Hopping Control Single-Inductor-Dual-Output Boost Regulator With Minimized Cross-Regulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12261997","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986759/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wide-Load-Range Constant-Charge-Auto-Hopping Control Single-Inductor-Dual-Output Boost Regulator With Minimized Cross-Regulation","sourcePdf":"jssc-mok-2162188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078889S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6031177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6031177","articleId":"5986759","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986760,"authors":[{"name":"Ugo Decanis","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/5986760/5986760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ugo Decanis (S'08) was born in Albenga (SV), Italy, in 1984.

The fine geometrical discontinuity such as the conductive arm, feed aperture, and finite end of the coaxial probe is approximated to the quasi-static models. The near fields in the vicinity of the probe end are also theoretically calculated from the uniformly charged disk model. It is shown that the spatial dependency of the near fields around the finite end of its probe agrees well with the direct solutions of the fine-grid (FG) FDTD simulation. The dominant functions of the near-field behaviors in the vicinity of the probe are easily incorporated into the correction factors of the coefficients for the 3-D Cartesian FDTD update equations. For the choice of the cell size in the proposed TW FDTD, the input admittances of a coaxial monopole probe in air are calculated and compared with the FG FDTD and the measured data. To evaluate the effects of the asymmetric geometry in the vicinity of the coaxial probe, coaxial-probe fed waveguide launchers are numerically analyzed as a function of the excitation frequency, the eccentric position, and the axial height of the coaxial probe. In comparison with the standard TW FDTD, the proposed TW FDTD provides a very close agreement with the reference data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6077122/05986765.pdf","startPage":"2808","endPage":"2815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2161881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2161881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077122","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Thin-Wire FDTD Analysis of Coaxial Probe Fed in Asymmetric Microwave Components","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Probes","Mathematical model","Coaxial components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial waveguides","finite difference time-domain analysis","waveguide components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D thin-wire FDTD analysis","coaxial probe fed","asymmetric microwave component","3D thin-wire finite-difference time-domain","fine geometrical discontinuity","conductive arm","feed aperture","finite end","quasi-static model","fine-grid FDTD simulation","near-field behavior","correction factor","3D Cartesian FDTD update equation","coaxial monopole probe","asymmetric geometry","coaxial-probe fed waveguide launcher","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coaxial probes","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","thin wires (TWs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"3-D Thin-Wire FDTD Analysis of Coaxial Probe Fed in Asymmetric Microwave Components","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5986765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12357236","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Thin-Wire FDTD Analysis of Coaxial Probe Fed in Asymmetric Microwave Components","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2161881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078554S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6077122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6077122","articleId":"5986765","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5986769,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Deilami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5993785/5986769/5986769-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sara Deilami (S'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, in 2000 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia in 2011.

Uncontrolled and random PEV charging can cause increased power losses, overloads and voltage fluctuations, which are all detrimental to the reliability and security of newly developing smart grids. Therefore, a real-time smart load management (RT-SLM) control strategy is proposed and developed for the coordination of PEV charging based on real-time (e.g., every 5 min) minimization of total cost of generating the energy plus the associated grid energy losses. The approach reduces generation cost by incorporating time-varying market energy prices and PEV owner preferred charging time zones based on priority selection. The RT-SLM algorithm appropriately considers random plug-in of PEVs and utilizes the maximum sensitivities selection (MSS) optimization. This approach enables PEVs to begin charging as soon as possible considering priority-charging time zones while complying with network operation criteria (such as losses, generation limits, and voltage profile). Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of SLM for the modified IEEE 23 kV distribution system connected to several low voltage residential networks populated with PEVs.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2159816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2159816","startPage":"456","endPage":"467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5993785/05986769.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Coordination of Plug-In Electric Vehicle Charging in Smart Grids to Minimize Power Losses and Improve Voltage Profile","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Coordination of Plug-In Electric Vehicle Charging in Smart Grids to Minimize Power Losses and Improve Voltage Profile","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12190340","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5986769/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Coordination of Plug-In Electric Vehicle Charging in Smart Grids to Minimize Power Losses and Improve Voltage Profile","sourcePdf":"tsg-masoum-2159816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075264S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5993785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"703","xplore-issue":"5993785","articleId":"5986769","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5986800,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Sabbaghian","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Sabbaghian","id":"37294633700"},{"name":"Yongjun Kwak","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongjun","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37954731000"},{"name":"Besma Smida","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Besma","lastName":"Smida","id":"37284080700"},{"name":"Vahid Tarokh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Tarokh","id":"37271249900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5986800","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1162},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Parity check codes","Turbo codes","Block codes","Decoding","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Shannon limit","peak to average power ratio","turbo block coded OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","PAPR codeword","coding scheme","frequency domain component","time domain component code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-frequency turbo block code","Chase algorithm","OFDM","PAPR","Reed-Muller code"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an advanced solution for the long standing problem of large peak to average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Although the design of low PAPR codewords has been extensively studied and the existence of asymptotically good codes with low PAPR is also proven, still no code has been constructed to satisfy all requirements. The main goal of the paper is to develop a coding scheme that not only generates low PAPR codewords, but it also performs relatively close to the Shannon limit. We achieve this goal by implementing a time-frequency turbo block coded OFDM. In this scheme, we design the frequency domain component to have a tightly bounded PAPR. The time domain component code is designed to obtain good performance while the decoding algorithm has reasonable complexity. Through comparative performance evaluation we show that utilizing the proposed method, we achieve considerable improvement in terms of PAPR while we slightly loose the performance compared to capacity achieving codes with similar overall block length.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.080111.090356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5986797/05986800.pdf","startPage":"2042","endPage":"2045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.080111.090356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near Shannon Limit and Low Peak to Average Power Ratio Turbo Block Coded OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5986800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Near Shannon Limit and Low Peak to Average Power Ratio Turbo Block Coded OFDM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5986800/","publicationDate":"August 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12206219","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5986800/","volume":"59","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near Shannon Limit and Low Peak to Average Power Ratio Turbo Block Coded OFDM","sourcePdf":"2042-tc1108-sabba.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047219S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5986797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5986797","articleId":"5986800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5986854,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["Electric and Information Engineering Department, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Lei Yang","id":"37675788300"},{"name":"Min Yu","affiliation":["Electric and Information Engineering Department, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Min Yu","id":"37895581000"},{"name":"Long Zhou","affiliation":["School of Transportation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Long Zhou","id":"37554174900"},{"name":"Yemao Xu","affiliation":["Department of System and Architecture, Wuhan Maritime Communications Research Institute, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Yemao Xu","id":"37961365600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9439-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9436-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9438-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5986854","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Broadband communication","Bismuth","Fading","Bit error rate","Channel models","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","error statistics","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive bit loading algorithm","shortwave broadband channel","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Fischer algorithm","bit error rate","Chow algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive bit loading","OFDM","shortwave broadband"]}],"abstract":"A kind of adaptive bit loading algorithm is proposed in this paper that is suitable for shortwave broadband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system.

The stator and mover of the Lorentz planar motor are coupled by electromagnetic forces without mechanical contact. Owing to end effect, magnetic leakage field, magnetic field coupling and material non-linear, magnetic field distribution in airgap is non-uniform. In this paper, 3-D electromagnetic finite element model of the Lorentz force-driven planar motor is established in order to achieve more precise simulation results. The magnetic field distribution in airgap and the relations of currents, displacements and Lorentz forces are obtained by Maxwell equations and virtual work principle.

The number of the users it can accommodate is greater than the spreading factor N. Each of the available orthogonal spreading sequences of length N is assigned to one of the first N users which employ a common Pseudo-Noise (PN) scrambling sequence. When the number of users K exceeds N, say K = N + M with M <; N, the M additional users reuse M of those orthogonal spreading sequences but in combination with another PN scrambling sequence. An iterative multistage detection technique is used to cancel the interference between the two sets of users when K>;N. The proposed technique thus accommodates N users without any mutual interference and a number of additional users whit little signal-to-noise ratio penalty.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5963833/5986834/05987217.pdf","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1442","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering","doi":"10.1109/MACE.2011.5987217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MACE.2011.5987217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5987217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel iterative detection of MC-CDMA with two sets of orthogonal spreading sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Bit error rate","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Signal to noise ratio","Binary phase shift keying","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","iterative methods","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative detection","orthogonal spreading sequences","multicarrier code-division multiple access","MC-CDMA system","spreading factor","pseudo-noise scrambling sequence","PN scrambling sequence","iterative multistage detection technique","interference cancellation","signal-to-noise ratio penalty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","Cell capacity","Multiple Access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5987217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel iterative detection of MC-CDMA with two sets of orthogonal spreading sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5987217/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12242998","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel iterative detection of MC-CDMA with two sets of orthogonal spreading sequences","confLoc":"Inner Mongolia, China","sourcePdf":"2132AC54743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051235S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5963833","isNumber":"5986834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5963833","xplore-issue":"5986834","articleId":"5987217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5987290,"authors":[{"name":"Huahong Ma","affiliation":["Electronic and Information College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Huahong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37961298200"},{"name":"Wenxia Wang","affiliation":["Electronic and Information College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Wenxia","lastName":"Wang","id":"37965053300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9439-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9436-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9438-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5987290","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Arrays","Antenna arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum genetic algorithm","adaptive array","smart antennas","array beamforming optimization problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Beam forming","Smart Antenna","Quantum Genetic Algorithm","Improved Genetic Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This article introduced the traditional genetic algorithm and quantum genetic algorithm at first.

Ground Stations (GS) are required during spacecraft (S/C) operations to provide communications links between operations teams and the S/C systems. Basic communication types, such as telemetry, tele-command and tracking, are all supported by the same satellite and GS systems. The allocation of ground resources to S/C is a highly constrained problem and traditionally has been conducted manually: stations are selected for communication support with certain S/C for certain periods. The manual approach has clear limitations and new modern scheduling approaches are needed to tackle with the complexity of the problem and produce optimal solutions to scheduling operations. We propose the use of Genetic Algorithm, a well-known family of population-based methods, for solving the problem. A series of genetic operators have been designed to find the configuration that outputs the best GA solution for the problem. The proposed GA has been implemented in Matlab and experimentally studied on a set of randomly generated instances. The results of the study showed the effectiveness of the proposed GA algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2011.29","startPage":"138","endPage":"145","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5986779/5988973/05988980.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2011.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5988973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for Ground Station Scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Space vehicles","Schedules","Scheduling","Arrays","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","scheduling","space vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","ground station scheduling","spacecraft","population-based methods","Matlab"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithms","Ground Scheduling","Spacecraft operations","Constraint optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5988980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for Ground Station Scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5988980/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12191089","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm for Ground Station Scheduling","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4373a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049865S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5986779","isNumber":"5988973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5986779","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5988973","articleId":"5988980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5989015,"authors":[{"name":"Admir Barolli","affiliation":["Seikei University, Japan"],"firstName":"Admir","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37590382400"},{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain","Seikei University, Japan"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"},{"name":"Christian S\u00b4nchez","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"S\u00b4nchez","id":"37087071541"},{"name":"Makoto Takizawa","affiliation":["Seikei University, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Takizawa","id":"37279376800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-709-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4373-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5989015","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989015","abstract":"With the emergence of wireless networking paradigm, several optimization problems are appearing in such networks. Such problem are related to optimizing network connectivity, coverage and stability. The resolution of these problems turns out to be crucial for optimized network performance. In the case of Wireless Mesh Networks, such problems include computing placement of mesh router nodes so that network performance is optimized. However, as these optimization problems are known to be computationally hard to solve, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been recently investigated as effective resolution methods. Mutation operator is one of the GA ingredients. Unlike crossover operators, which achieve to transmit genetic information from parents to off springs, mutation operators usually make some small local perturbation of the individuals, having thus less impact on individuals. Moreover, crossover is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a must\u00e2\u20ac\u009d operator in GA and is usually applied with high probability, while mutation operators when implemented, are applied with small probability. Due to this, mutation operator is usually considered as a secondary operator. However, many studies in the literature have shown that mutation when effectively combined with selection operators can improve the performance of GAs. In this work we present the results of an experimental study on the effect of mutation and selection operators in GA for mesh router nodes placement problem. The study aims to identify the mutation and selection types that work best for instances of different characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2011.15","startPage":"32","endPage":"39","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5986779/5988973/05989015.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2011.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5988973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on the Effect of Mutation in Genetic Algorithms for Mesh Router Placement Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetics","Optimization","Network topology","Biological cells","Topology","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","telecommunication network routing","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mesh router placement problem","wireless mesh networks","mutation operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Mesh Networks","Mutation Operators","Selection Operators","Genetic Algorithms","Size of Giant Component","User Coverage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Study on the Effect of Mutation in Genetic Algorithms for Mesh Router Placement Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12191120","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on the Effect of Mutation in Genetic Algorithms for Mesh Router Placement Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4373a032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089274S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5986779","isNumber":"5988973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5986779","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5988973","articleId":"5989015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5989027,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Bogdanski","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Bogdanski","id":"37601651500"},{"name":"Joanna Kolodziej","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Bielsko-Biala, Poland"],"firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Kolodziej","id":"37397617200"},{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Department of Languages and Informatics Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-709-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4373-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5989027","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Schedules","Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Processor scheduling","Genetics","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","grid computing","neural nets","resource allocation","scheduling","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security awareness","GA-based grid schedulers","artificial neural networks","task scheduling","resource allocation","computational grids","resolution methods","task abortion awareness","scheduling criteria","security demand parameters","genetic scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational Grid","Scheduling","Artificial Neural Network","Data Classification","Security","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989027","abstract":"Task scheduling and resource allocation remain still challenging problems in Computational Grids (CGs). Traditional computational models and resolution methods cannot effectively tackle the complex nature of Grid, where the resources and users belong to many administrative domains with their own access policies and users' privileges, and security and task abortion awareness are addressed as important scheduling criteria. In this paper we propose a neural network approach for supporting the security awareness of the genetic-based grid schedulers. Making a prior analysis of trust levels of the resources and security demand parameters of tasks, the neural network monitors the scheduling and task execution processes. The network learns patterns in input (tasks and machines initial characteristics) and outputs (information about resource failures and the resulting tasks and machines characteristics) data, and finally sub-optimal schedules are generated, which are then used to modify the initialization procedures of genetic scheduling algorithms. We extended the Hyper Sim-G Grid simulator framework by Neural Network module to evaluate the proposed model under the heterogeneity, the large-scale and dynamics conditions. The relative performance of GA-based and Neural Network GA-based schedulers is measured by the make span and flow time metrics. The obtained results showed the efficacy of the Neural Network approach to enhance the secure GA-based schedulers.","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2011.47","startPage":"277","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2011.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5988973","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5986779/5988973/05989027.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supporting the Security Awareness of GA-based Grid Schedulers by Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989027/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Supporting the Security Awareness of GA-based Grid Schedulers by Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989027/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12191132","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting the Security Awareness of GA-based Grid Schedulers by Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4373a277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084187S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5986779","isNumber":"5988973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5986779","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5988973","articleId":"5989027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5989042,"authors":[{"name":"Silvia Franchini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Franchini","id":"37712314600"},{"name":"Antonio Gentile","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Gentile","id":"37272345500"},{"name":"Filippo Sorbello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Sorbello","id":"37267055400"},{"name":"Giorgio Vassallo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Vassallo","id":"37318317800"},{"name":"Salvatore Vitabile","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Vitabile","id":"37267052200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-709-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4373-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5989042","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"abstract":"Computer graphics applications require efficient tools to model geometric objects and their transformations. Clifford algebra (also known as geometric algebra) is receiving a growing attention in many research fields, such as computer graphics, machine vision and robotics, as a new, interesting computational paradigm that offers a natural and intuitive way to perform geometric calculations. At the same time, compute-intensive graphics algorithms require the execution of million Clifford operations. Clifford algebra based software intensive systems need therefore the support of specialized hardware architectures capable of accelerating Clifford operations execution. In this paper the architecture of CliffoSorII (Clifford coprocessor II), an embedded coprocessor that offers direct hardware support to Clifford algebra operations, is introduced. The coprocessor has been designed, implemented and tested on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. The experimental results show the potential to achieve a 20\u00d7 speedup for Clifford sums and differences and a 5\u00d7 speedup for Clifford products against the analogous operations in Gaigen, a standard geometric algebra software library generator for general purpose processors. An execution analysis of a ray tracing application is also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5986779/5988973/05989042.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"342","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2011.55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2011.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5988973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Embedded Coprocessor for Clifford Algebra Based Software Intensive Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algebra","Coprocessors","Blades","Random access memory","Hardware","Computer architecture","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","computational geometry","computer graphics","coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded coprocessor","Clifford algebra","software intensive systems","computer graphics applications","geometric algebra","machine vision","robotics","geometric calculations","field programmable gate array","FPGA","geometric algebra software library generator","ray tracing application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clifford algebra","computational geometry","computer graphics","compute-intensive algorithms","software intensive systems","embedded coprocessors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"A New Embedded Coprocessor for Clifford Algebra Based Software Intensive Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12191147","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Embedded Coprocessor for Clifford Algebra Based Software Intensive Systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4373a335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117464S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5986779","isNumber":"5988973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5986779","xplore-issue":"5988973","articleId":"5989042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5989048,"authors":[{"name":"Catalin Radu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Catalin","lastName":"Radu","id":"38230906500"},{"name":"Catalin Leordeanu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Catalin","lastName":"Leordeanu","id":"37063360600"},{"name":"Valentin Cristea","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Cristea","id":"37322099900"},{"name":"Daniel Luchaup","affiliation":["Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Luchaup","id":"37860372800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-709-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4373-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5989048","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doped fiber amplifiers","Computer architecture","Intrusion detection","Microprocessors","Program processors","Pattern matching","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","pattern matching","security of data","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["using cell processors","regular expression matching","network intrusion detection systems","network traffic","signature matching algorithms","cell architecture","parallel pattern matching algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intrusion detection","dfa matching","parallel algorithm","cell architecture"]}],"abstract":"The main purpose of network intrusion detection systems is to determine whether incoming network traffic matches known attack signatures. To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures. This paper presents a method which uses the Cell architecture to run an adapted speculative parallel pattern matching algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the advantages brought by our of our approach are significant compared to the serial implementation and other parallel ones. We also emphasize the advantages brought by the characteristics of the Cell architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Cell Processors for Intrusion Detection through Regular Expression Matching with Speculation","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2011.38","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5986779/5988973/05989048.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2011.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5988973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Using Cell Processors for Intrusion Detection through Regular Expression Matching with Speculation","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989048/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12191153","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Cell Processors for Intrusion Detection through Regular Expression Matching with Speculation","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4373a203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047693S","chronDate":"June 30 2011-July 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5986779","isNumber":"5988973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5986779","xplore-issue":"5988973","articleId":"5989048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5989077,"authors":[{"name":"Sazia Parvin","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems & Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Australia, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Sazia","lastName":"Parvin","id":"37392791500"},{"name":"Song Han","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems & Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Australia, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Han","id":"37404245900"},{"name":"Farookh Hussain","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems & Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Australia, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Farookh","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37294449300"},{"name":"Biming Tian","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems & Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Australia, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Biming","lastName":"Tian","id":"37409562200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-709-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4373-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5989077","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Base stations","Public key","Artificial intelligence","Ad hoc networks","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational approach","trust establishment","cognitive radio networks","radio electromagnetic spectrum","secure communication","certificate-based trust","behavior-based trust","predeployment trust relation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trust","primary user","secondary user","security","cognitive radio networks","radio"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio is considered as a promising and demanding technology to examine whether a particular radio spectrum band is currently in use or not and to switch into the temporarily unoccupied spectrum band in order to improve the usage of the radio electromagnetic spectrum without creating interference to the transmissions of other users.

A feature selection algorithm may be evaluated from both the efficiency and effectiveness points of view. While the efficiency concerns the time required to find a subset of features, the effectiveness is related to the quality of the subset of features. Based on these criteria, a fast clustering-based feature selection algorithm (FAST) is proposed and experimentally evaluated in this paper. The FAST algorithm works in two steps. In the first step, features are divided into clusters by using graph-theoretic clustering methods. In the second step, the most representative feature that is strongly related to target classes is selected from each cluster to form a subset of features. Features in different clusters are relatively independent, the clustering-based strategy of FAST has a high probability of producing a subset of useful and independent features. To ensure the efficiency of FAST, we adopt the efficient minimum-spanning tree (MST) clustering method. The efficiency and effectiveness of the FAST algorithm are evaluated through an empirical study. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare FAST and several representative feature selection algorithms, namely, FCBF, ReliefF, CFS, Consist, and FOCUS-SF, with respect to four types of well-known classifiers, namely, the probability-based Naive Bayes, the tree-based C4.5, the instance-based IB1, and the rule-based RIPPER before and after feature selection.

In such a scheme, during each periodic data gathering tour, the mobile collector stays at each anchor point for a period of sojourn time, and in the meanwhile the nearby sensors transmit data to the collector in a multihop fashion. In this paper, we focus on such a data gathering scheme and provide distributed algorithms to achieve its optimal performance. We consider two different cases depending on whether the mobile collector has fixed or variable sojourn time at each anchor point. We adopt network utility, which is a properly defined function, to characterize the data gathering performance, and formalize the problems as network utility maximization problems under the constraints of guaranteed network lifetime and data gathering latency. To efficiently solve these problems, we decompose each of them into several subproblems and solve them in a distributed manner, which facilitates the scalable implementation of the optimization algorithms. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results to demonstrate the usage and efficiency of the proposed algorithms and complement our theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6269879/05989821.pdf","startPage":"1464","endPage":"1477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization-Based Distributed Algorithms for Mobile Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989821/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization-Based Distributed Algorithms for Mobile Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"11","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933213","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989821/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization-Based Distributed Algorithms for Mobile Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2012101464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049528S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","isNumber":"6269879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"57","articleId":"5989821","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5989824,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Junfeng Pan","affiliation":["Facebook Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6136512/5989824/5989824-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeffrey Junfeng Pan received the BS degree in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University in China in 2003, and the PhD degree in computer science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2008.

One of the fundamental issues is how to accurately locate a user with few labeled data in a wireless sensor network, where a major difficulty arises from the need to label large quantities of user location data, which in turn requires knowledge about the locations of signal transmitters or access points. To solve this problem, we have developed a novel machine learning-based approach that combines collaborative filtering with graph-based semi-supervised learning to learn both mobile users' locations and the locations of access points. Our framework exploits both labeled and unlabeled data from mobile devices and access points. In our two-phase solution, we first build a manifold-based model from a batch of labeled and unlabeled data in an offline training phase and then use a weighted k-nearest-neighbor method to localize a mobile client in an online localization phase. We extend the two-phase colocalization to an online and incremental model that can deal with labeled and unlabeled data that come sequentially and adapt to environmental changes. Finally, we embed an action model to the framework such that additional kinds of sensor signals can be utilized to further boost the performance of mobile tracking. Compared to other state-of-the-art systems, our framework has been shown to be more accurate while requiring less calibration effort in our experiments performed on three different testbeds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989824/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","volume":"34","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"12487347","pubMedId":"21844623","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989824/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tracking Mobile Users in Wireless Networks via Semi-Supervised Colocalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking Mobile Users in Wireless Networks via Semi-Supervised Colocalization","sourcePdf":"ttp2012030587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093915S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6136512","articleId":"5989824","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5989827,"authors":[{"name":"Tom E.

In a single snapshot, they enable digital image refocusing and 3D reconstruction. We show that they obtain a larger depth of field but maintain the ability to reconstruct detail at high resolution. In fact, all depths are approximately focused, except for a thin slab where blur size is bounded, i.e., their depth of field is essentially inverted compared to regular cameras. Crucial to their success is the way they sample the LF, trading off spatial versus angular resolution, and how aliasing affects the LF. We show that applying traditional multiview stereo methods to the extracted low-resolution views can result in reconstruction errors due to aliasing. We address these challenges using an explicit image formation model, and incorporate Lambertian and texture preserving priors to reconstruct both scene depth and its superresolved texture in a variational Bayesian framework, eliminating aliasing by fusing multiview information. We demonstrate the method on synthetic and real images captured with our LF camera, and show that it can outperform other computational camera systems.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6171978/05989827.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6171978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"972","endPage":"986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Light Field Camera: Extended Depth of Field, Aliasing, and Superresolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Light Field Camera: Extended Depth of Field, Aliasing, and Superresolution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989827/","volume":"34","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5989827/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12617601","pubMedId":"21844629","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Light Field Camera: Extended Depth of Field, Aliasing, and Superresolution","sourcePdf":"ttp2012050972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190318S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6171978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"6171978","articleId":"5989827","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5989829,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6155150/5989829/5989829-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Yang received the BS degree from the College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University in 2003, and the PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science at Zhejiang University in 2010.

First, we propose a new semi-supervised algorithm called ranking with Local Regression and Global Alignment (LRGA) to learn a robust Laplacian matrix for data ranking. In LRGA, for each data point, a local linear regression model is used to predict the ranking scores of its neighboring points. A unified objective function is then proposed to globally align the local models from all the data points so that an optimal ranking score can be assigned to each data point. Second, we propose a semi-supervised long-term Relevance Feedback (RF) algorithm to refine the multimedia data representation. The proposed long-term RF algorithm utilizes both the multimedia data distribution in multimedia feature space and the history RF information provided by users. A trace ratio optimization problem is then formulated and solved by an efficient algorithm. The algorithms have been applied to several content-based multimedia retrieval applications, including cross-media retrieval, image retrieval, and 3D motion/pose data retrieval.

[48], the accuracy of dense multiview stereovision methods has been increasing steadily. A number of limitations, however, make most of these methods not suitable to outdoor scenes taken under uncontrolled imaging conditions. The present work consists of a complete dense multiview stereo pipeline which circumvents these limitations, being able to handle large-scale scenes without sacrificing accuracy. Highly detailed reconstructions are produced within very reasonable time thanks to two key stages in our pipeline: a minimum s-t cut optimization over an adaptive domain that robustly and efficiently filters a quasidense point cloud from outliers and reconstructs an initial surface by integrating visibility constraints, followed by a mesh-based variational refinement that captures small details, smartly handling photo-consistency, regularization, and adaptive resolution. The pipeline has been tested over a wide range of scenes: from classic compact objects taken in a laboratory setting, to outdoor architectural scenes, landscapes, and cultural heritage sites. The accuracy of its reconstructions has also been measured on the dense multiview benchmark proposed by Strecha et al. [59], showing the results to compare more than favorably with the current state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6171978/05989831.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6171978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Accuracy and Visibility-Consistent Dense Multiview Stereo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989831/","displayDocTitle":"High Accuracy and Visibility-Consistent Dense Multiview Stereo","volume":"34","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12617602","pubMedId":"21844631","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989831/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Accuracy and Visibility-Consistent Dense Multiview Stereo","sourcePdf":"ttp2012050889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084557S","chronDate":"May  2012","isNumber":"6171978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"150","articleId":"5989831","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5989835,"authors":[{"name":"Weina Ge","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6171978/5989835/5989835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weina Ge received the PhD degree in computer science and engineering from The Pennsylvania State University in 2005.

To reduce this mismatch we created an approach called EXEcutable exaMPLes ARchive (Exemplar) for finding highly relevant software projects from large archives of applications. After a programmer enters a natural-language query that contains high-level concepts (e.g., MIME, datasets), Exemplar retrieves applications that implement these concepts. Exemplar ranks applications in three ways. First, we consider the descriptions of applications. Second, we examine the Application Programming Interface (API) calls used by applications. Third, we analyze the dataflow among those API calls. We performed two case studies (with professional and student developers) to evaluate how these three rankings contribute to the quality of the search results from Exemplar. The results of our studies show that the combined ranking of application descriptions and API documents yields the most-relevant search results. We released Exemplar and our case study data to the public.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2011.84","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/6311391/05989838.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2011.84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exemplar: A Source Code Search Engine for Finding Highly Relevant Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989838/","displayDocTitle":"Exemplar: A Source Code Search Engine for Finding Highly Relevant Applications","volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13014851","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989838/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exemplar: A Source Code Search Engine for Finding Highly Relevant Applications","sourcePdf":"tts2012051069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158675S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6311391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6311391","articleId":"5989838","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5989839,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Rao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6106039/5989839/5989839-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Rao received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.","She is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QC Canada.

As the demand on Internet services and cloud computing has kept increasing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations has been uprising significantly. The cyber and physical aspects of IDCs interact with each other, and bring unprecedented challenges in power management. While most existing research focuses on reducing power consumptions of IDCs at one specific location, the problem of reducing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the present multielectricity-market environment, where the price of electricity may exhibit temporal and spatial diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS; i.e., service level objectives) such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of critical importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost geared to QoS constraint as well as the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price under multiregional electricity markets. We jointly consider both the cyber and physical management capabilities of IDCs, and exploit both the center-level load balancing and the server-level power control in a unified scheme. We model the problem as a constrained mixed integer programming based on generalized benders decomposition (GBD) technique. Extensive evaluations based on real-life electricity price data for multiple IDC locations demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161236","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6106039/05989839.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Coordination of Internet Data Centers Under Multiregional Electricity Markets","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989839/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Coordination of Internet Data Centers Under Multiregional Electricity Markets","volume":"100","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425467","htmlLink":"/document/5989839/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Coordination of Internet Data Centers Under Multiregional Electricity Markets","sourcePdf":"jproc-rao-2161236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151108S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6106039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6106039","articleId":"5989839","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5989840,"authors":[{"name":"Michelly de Souza","affiliation":["Centro Universit\u00e1rio da FEI, S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Michelly","lastName":"de Souza","id":"37587379700"},{"name":"Marcelo A.

Experimental results of drain current, subthreshold slope, maximum transconductance at low electric field, and threshold voltage, as well as its variation with temperature, are presented. Unlike in classical devices, the drain current of JNTs decreases when temperature is lowered, although the maximum transconductance increases when the temperature is lowered down to 125 K. An analytical model for the threshold voltage is proposed to explain the influence of nanowire width and doping concentration on its variation with temperature. It is shown that the wider the nanowire or the lower the doping concentration, the higher the threshold voltage variation with temperature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryogenic Operation of Junctionless Nanowire Transistors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2011.2161748","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/6028517/05989840.pdf","startPage":"1322","endPage":"1324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2011.2161748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenic Operation of Junctionless Nanowire Transistors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5989840/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245389","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenic Operation of Junctionless Nanowire Transistors","sourcePdf":"led-desouza-2161748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085923S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6028517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6028517","articleId":"5989840","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5989844,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Barletta","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Barletta","id":"37946864400"},{"name":"Maurizio Magarini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Magarini","id":"37268262100"},{"name":"Arnaldo Spalvieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Spalvieri","id":"37268261400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5989844","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN","Quantization","Probability density function","Channel capacity","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","Markov processes","phase noise","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov phase noise channels","information rates","discrete-time channels","first-order channels","additive white Gaussian noise channel","Wiener phase noise","channel capacity","quantization","phase space","trellis representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information rates","optical communication","phase noise"]}],"abstract":"The constrained capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise channel affected by Wiener phase noise is investigated in the letter.

A new finite Student's-t mixture model (SMM) is proposed in this paper. Existing models do not explicitly incorporate the spatial relationships between pixels. First, our model exploits Dirichlet distribution and Dirichlet law to incorporate the local spatial constrains in an image. Secondly, we directly deal with the Student's-t distribution in order to estimate the model parameters, whereas, the Student's-t distributions in previous models are represented as an infinite mixture of scaled Gaussians that lead to an increase in complexity. Finally, instead of using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method adopts the gradient method to minimize the higher bound on the data negative log-likelihood and to optimize the parameters. The proposed model is successfully compared to the state-of-the-art finite mixture models.

The approach uses supervised learning where the class labels are, in contrast to previous work, based on measured lung function instead of on manually annotated regions of interest (ROIs). A quantitative measure of COPD is obtained by fusing COPD probabilities computed in ROIs within the lung fields where the individual ROI probabilities are computed using a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n nearest neighbor (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\nNN ) classifier. The distance between two ROIs in the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\nNN classifier is computed as the textural dissimilarity between the ROIs, where the ROI texture is described by histograms of filter responses from a multi-scale, rotation invariant Gaussian filter bank. The method was trained on 400 images from a lung cancer screening trial and subsequently applied to classify 200 independent images from the same screening trial. The texture-based measure was significantly better at discriminating between subjects with and without COPD than were the two most common quantitative measures of COPD in the literature, which are based on density. The proposed measure achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.713 whereas the best performing density measure achieved an AUC of 0.598. Further, the proposed measure is as reproducible as the density measures, and there were indications that it correlates better with lung function and is less influenced by inspiration level.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2164931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6112725/05989868.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"78","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2164931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture-Based Analysis of COPD: A Data-Driven Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Texture-Based Analysis of COPD: A Data-Driven Approach","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5989868/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12437685","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","pubMedId":"21859615","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture-Based Analysis of COPD: A Data-Driven Approach","sourcePdf":"tmi-srensen-2164931-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097508S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6112725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6112725","articleId":"5989868","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5989872,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Jia","affiliation":["Department of Systems Science, School of Management, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/6104235/5989872/5989872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Jia received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in systems science from the Department of Systems Science, School of Management, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","His research interest was in peer-to-peer trust and reputation systems."]},"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Jia","id":"38242251200"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Systems Science, School of Management, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/6104235/5989872/5989872-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Xie received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in systems science from the Department of Systems Science, School of Management, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","His research interest is in multiagent systems.

Therefore, trust and reputation mechanisms become important issues. For computational efficiency, this paper focuses on localized information trust/reputation mechanisms. Previous studies have not paid much attention to the overall distribution of peer interactions. Based on the scale-free feature of real-world networks, we introduce a power-law distribution of the number of neighbors in P2P trust and reputation systems. To rigorously distinguish the effects of the overall considerations introduced herein, we compare the model proposed in this paper with models in previous studies under the same set of parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed model can discern a small difference between real quality of service (QoS) and other peers' feedback while distinguishing the malicious peers, even when the exaggeration coefficient is high. When one or a group of peers change their QoS, the model exhibits a quick reaction to this change. This response is demonstrated by a rapid decrease in reliability when the QoS change is downward and a slow increase when the change is upward. A slow reaction to the upward QoS change may exclude those peers who frequently change their QoS and encourage consistent reliable service providers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/6104235/05989872.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2162497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2162497","startPage":"164","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Trust and Reputation Model Considering Overall Peer Consulting Distribution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989872/","displayDocTitle":"A Trust and Reputation Model Considering Overall Peer Consulting Distribution","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989872/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"12410466","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trust and Reputation Model Considering Overall Peer Consulting Distribution","sourcePdf":"tsmca-han-2162497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09807S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"6104235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6104235","articleId":"5989872","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5989873,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Gogineni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6041052/5989873/5989873-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sandeep Gogineni (S'08) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communications engineering (with Hons. in signal processing and communications) from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), MO, in 2009.","He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from WUSTL.

The proposed SSFPGA employs a 38 \u00d7 38 array of four-input, three-stage self-synchronous configurable logic blocks, with the introduction of a new dual tree-divider four-input, three-pipeline stage LUT to achieve a 2.97 GHz throughput at 1.2 V. Correct operation is measured with 500 mVp-p, 1.12 GHz externally introduced power supply noise at 1.2 V power supply, equivalent to 42% power supply bounce. Sensitivity against power supply noise frequency has been measured, and confirmed with simulation results to show a strong correlation with the average operating frequency. Correct operation was shown over 10 chips with 16% performance variation, with VDD change from 728 mV to 2 V, and temperature change from 0\u00b0C to 120\u00b0C, without tuning any input parameters such as clock frequency, supply voltages and biases. Results show the SSFPGA can adapt and is inherently robust to these variations with internal throughput measured from 300 MHz to 4.07 GHz, while maintaining correct operation. The operation under noisey power supply conditions is compared to a conventional synchronous FPGA, which show the SSFPGA has 4.2 times error free operation. The failure mode is also measured on the SSFPGA using an accelerated stress cycle between 0\u00b0C and 120\u00b0C at 2 V, showing the SSFPGA has 8% longer correct operation before chip malfunction past a 10% delay margin commonly used in synchronous systems.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6056707/05989874.pdf","startPage":"2500","endPage":"2513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 65 nm Gate-Level Pipelined Self-Synchronous FPGA for High Performance and Variation Robust Operation","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2164024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2164024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A 65 nm Gate-Level Pipelined Self-Synchronous FPGA for High Performance and Variation Robust Operation","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12308567","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5989874/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 65 nm Gate-Level Pipelined Self-Synchronous FPGA for High Performance and Variation Robust Operation","sourcePdf":"jssc-devlin-2164024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066954S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6056707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6056707","articleId":"5989874","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5989876,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

While we do not address the problem of efficiency, we formally demonstrate that this framework guarantees soundness, or goal reachability, using workflow nets.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2011.2163510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6112271/05989876.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2011.2163510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Workflow Nets for Multiagent Cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989876/","displayDocTitle":"Workflow Nets for Multiagent Cooperation","volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12426102","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989876/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Workflow Nets for Multiagent Cooperation","sourcePdf":"tase-beauchemin-2163510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081243S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6112271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6112271","articleId":"5989876","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5989879,"authors":[{"name":"Farokh Irom","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Farokh","lastName":"Irom","id":"37283251500"},{"name":"Duc N.

For example, the recently proposed OpenFlow switching requires classifying each packet using up to 12-tuple packet header fields. It has become a great challenge to develop scalable solutions for next-generation packet classification that support higher throughput, larger rule sets and more packet header fields. This paper exploits the abundant parallelism and other desirable features provided by current field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and proposes a decision-tree-based, 2-D multi-pipeline architecture for next-generation packet classification. We revisit the techniques for traditional 5-tuple packet classification and propose several optimization techniques for the state-of-the-art decision-tree-based algorithm. Given a set of 12-tuple rules, we develop a framework to partition the rule set into multiple subsets each of which is built into an optimized decision tree. A tree-to-pipeline mapping scheme is carefully designed to maximize the memory utilization while sustaining high throughput. The implementation results show that our architecture can store either 10K real-life 5-tuple rules or 1K synthetic 12-tuple rules in on-chip memory of a single state-of-the-art FPGA, and sustain 80 and 40 Gbps throughput for minimum size (40 bytes) packets, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2162112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6236332/05989886.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2162112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6236332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Packet Classification on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Packet Classification on FPGA","volume":"20","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12862747","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989886/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989886/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Packet Classification on FPGA","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jiang-2162112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198901S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6236332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6236332","articleId":"5989886","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5989889,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6226889/5989889/5989889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Xu is currently working toward the PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis.

This paper studies optimal bandwidth allocation of SUs for throughput efficiency. Consider the following tradeoff: an SU increases its instantaneous throughput by accessing more spectrum, but channel access/switching overhead, contention among multiple SUs, and dynamic PU activity create higher liability for larger bandwidths. So how much is too much? In this paper, we study the optimal bandwidth allocation for multiple SUs. Our approach is twofold. We first study the optimal bandwidth an SU should use to maximize the per-SU throughput in the long term. The optimal bandwidth is derived in the context of dynamic PU activity, where we consider both independent and correlated PU channel scenarios while accounting for the effects of channel switching overhead. We further consider the case of suboptimal spectrum use by SUs in the short term due to PU activity dynamics. We propose an efficient channel reconfiguration (CREC) scheme to improve SUs' performance. We use real PU channel activity traces in the simulations to validate our results. The work sheds light on the design of spectrum sharing protocols in cognitive radio networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","volume":"11","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989889/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Fair Bandwidth Allocation in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Fair Bandwidth Allocation in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2012081372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137805S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6226889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6226889","articleId":"5989889","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5989891,"authors":[{"name":"Minghua Xia","affiliation":["Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/5989891/5989891-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minghua Xia obtained his Ph.D. degree in Telecommunications and Information Systems from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2007.

The performance of dual-hop semi-blind amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems was extensively investigated, for transmissions over Rayleigh fading channels or Nakagami-m fading channels with integer fading parameter. For the general Nakagami-m fading with arbitrary m values, the exact closed-form system performance analysis is more challenging. In this paper, we explicitly derive the moment generation function (MGF), probability density function (PDF) and moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over arbitrary Nakagami-m fading channels with semi-blind AF relay. With these results, the system performance evaluation in terms of outage probability, average symbol error probability, ergodic capacity and diversity order, is conducted. The analysis developed in this paper applies to any semi-blind AF relaying systems with fixed relay gain, and two major strategies for computing the relay gain are compared in terms of system performance. All analytical results are corroborated by simulation results and they are shown to be efficient tools to evaluate system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact Performance Analysis of Dual-Hop Semi-Blind AF Relaying over Arbitrary Nakagami-m Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.102267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05989891.pdf","startPage":"3449","endPage":"3459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.102267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"Exact Performance Analysis of Dual-Hop Semi-Blind AF Relaying over Arbitrary Nakagami-m Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5989891/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359520","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Performance Analysis of Dual-Hop Semi-Blind AF Relaying over Arbitrary Nakagami-m Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"3449-tw1110-xia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085182S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5989891","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5989892,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech-\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/5989892/5989892-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Liu received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

Two ways of choosing the EM complete data are compared: a complete data built from observations and transmitted symbols (CL-EM) and a complete data chosen by decomposing noise and observation components (NCD-EM). Both CL-EM and NCD-EM algorithms are derived for a coded OFDM system. The rate of convergence of both EM algorithms is theoretically determined. It is found that the rate of convergence of CL-EM is independent from the number of channel taps at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while that of NCD-EM varies with the number of taps. It is shown that CL-EM converges in a few iterations. Furthermore, considering the complexity per iteration, CL-EM has a lower complexity than its counterpart. We also establish a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for coded OFDM transmission. Simulation results show that CL-EM has a good performance-complexity trade-off and it achieves the CRB.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.100249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","startPage":"3185","endPage":"3195","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05989892.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.100249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-Based Channel Estimation for Coded Multi-Carrier Transmissions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Convergence","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","convergence of numerical methods","data communication","expectation-maximisation algorithm","iterative methods","modulation coding","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation maximization algorithm","channel estimation","coded multicarrier transmissions","iterative algorithms","impulse response","frequency selective multipath channel","coded OFDM system","CL-EM algorithms","NCD-EM algorithms","convergence","signal-to-noise ratio","Cramer-Rao bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","expectation maximization","channel estimation","rate of convergence","Cramer-Rao bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"EM-Based Channel Estimation for Coded Multi-Carrier Transmissions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5989892/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12359521","publicationDate":"October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM-Based Channel Estimation for Coded Multi-Carrier Transmissions","sourcePdf":"3185-tw1110-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063494S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5989892","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5989893,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this contribution, transmission delay and packet loss rate constraints in the data link layer (DLL) are invoked in order to determine the optimum outer loop SNR-target setpoint analytically, according to the number of active users in cell. Optimality is, in this sense, the maximization of system throughput. Using the optimum SNR-target, the optimal spreading factor is determined. Subsequently, the joint optimization of outer loop SNR-target and variable spreading factor (VSF), at the physical(PHY)-layer, with truncated automatic repeat request (ARQ) error control mechanism at the data link layer are proposed. Hence, we show that quality of service (QoS) requirements at these layers can be simultaneously satisfied while maximizing throughput. Total and truncated channel inversion strategies are employed in the inner loop to adapt transmit power to short-time channel variations. We propose a system where the number of users in a cell is modeled by a one-dimensional discrete Markov chain, and design the adaptive continuous power and rate mechanism for the worst case packet error rate (PER) condition. The corresponding theoretical throughput, which can be regarded as upper-bound for discrete spreading factor case, is obtained numerically for various settings of system parameters. We have also provided simulation results for a practical channel condition. Our scheme is compared with \"constant SNR-target\" and \"PHY-layer based variable SNR-target\" cases under continuous power and rate variation to show the achievable gain through the coupling of physical and data link layers parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Physical Layer and Data Link Layer Optimization of CDMA-Based Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.101301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05989893.pdf","startPage":"3278","endPage":"3287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.101301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989893/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Physical Layer and Data Link Layer Optimization of CDMA-Based Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5989893/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Physical Layer and Data Link Layer Optimization of CDMA-Based Networks","sourcePdf":"3278-tw1110-shoja.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153815S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5989893","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5989895,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/5989895/5989895-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hu Jin (S'07) received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), China, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 2006.

The SU-MIMO scheme achieves a MIMO multiplexing gain at physical (PHY) layer while the MU-MIMO scheme achieves a MIMO multiplexing gain at medium access control (MAC) layer. Thus, there is a fundamental question which scheme is a better solution for uplink WLANs and, in this paper, we analyze and compare these two schemes with random STA distribution scenarios. Moreover, with the adaptation of MAC layer parameters, we also analyze and compare the maximum throughput performance of both the SU- and MU-MIMO schemes in uplink WLANs and we find a proper decision criterion to select the MIMO mode in uplink WLANs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05989895.pdf","startPage":"3332","endPage":"3342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.101980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.101980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tradeoff Between Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Schemes in Multi-Rate Uplink WLANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Wireless LAN","Receivers","Transmitting antennas","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO scheme","multirate uplink WLAN","multiple-input multiple-output transmission techniques","IEEE 802.11n","single-user MIMO","SU-MIMO","MU-MIMO","multi-packet reception","MPR","medium access control layer","MAC layer","STA distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11n","multi-user MIMO","multi-packet reception","multi-rate WLAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Tradeoff Between Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Schemes in Multi-Rate Uplink WLANs","volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5989895/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359524","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tradeoff Between Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Schemes in Multi-Rate Uplink WLANs","sourcePdf":"3332-tw1110-jin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093469S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5989895","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5989896,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/5989896/5989896-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sun Sun received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2005.

DSTC is shown to achieve full diversity in relay networks. To use DSTC, the receiver has to know both the channels between the relays and the receiver (Relay-Rx channels), and the channels between the transmitter and the relays (Tx-Relay channels). For the Relay-Rx channels, by sending pilot signals from the relays, the training problem can be solved using multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) training schemes. Given the knowledge of the Relay-Rx channels, to obtain estimations of the Tx-Relay channels at the receiver, DSTC is used. The linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimation at the receiver and the optimal pilot design that minimizes the estimation error are derived. We also investigate the requirement on the training time that can lead to full diversity in data transmission. An upper bound and a lower bound on the training time are provided. A novel training design whose training time length is adaptive to the quality of the Relay-Rx channels is also proposed. Simulations are exhibited to justify our analytical results and to show advantages of the proposed scheme over others.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.102004","startPage":"3380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05989896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080311.102004","endPage":"3391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Training Design in Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"Channel Training Design in Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Networks","volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5989896/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12359525","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Training Design in Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"3380-tw1110-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091342S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5989896","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5989897,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Lang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, FuJen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Lang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278393800"},{"name":"Da-You Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, FuJen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Da-You","lastName":"Hong","id":"37593018800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5989897","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":522},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","Equalizers","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","Toeplitz matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace channel estimation","fast convergence","single-input multiple-output systems","ZP-OFDM systems","zero-padded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","channel matrix","block Toeplitz","block matrix scheme","subvector samples","sample correlation matrix","noise subspace"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","SIMO","noise subspace","channel estimation","Toeplitz","equalization"]}],"abstract":"Novel subspace channel estimation with fast convergence is proposed for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) zero-padded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ZP-OFDM) systems.

Recent efforts in building a smart grid system have focused on addressing the problems of global warming effects, rising energy-hungry demands, and risks of peak loads. One of the major goals of the new system is to effectively regulate energy usage by utilizing the backbone of the prospectively deployed Automatic Meter Reading (AMR), Advanced Meter Infrastructure (AMI), and Demand Response (DR) programs via the advanced distribution automation and dynamic pricing models. The function of the power grid is no longer a system that only supplies energy to end users, but also allows consumers to contribute their clean energy back to the grid in the future. In the meantime, communications networks in the electric power infrastructure enact critical roles. Intelligent automation proposed in smart grid projects include the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition/Energy Management Systems (SCADA/EMS) and Phasor Management Units (PMU) in transmission networks, as well as the AMR/AMI associated with field/neighborhood area networks (FAN/NAN) and home area networks (HAN) at the distribution and end-use levels. This article provides an overview of the essentials of the progressive smart grid paradigm and integration of different communications technologies for the legacy power system. Additionally, foreseeable issues and challenges in designing communications networks for the smart grid system are also rigorously deliberated in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","volume":"14","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"12884102","publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5989902/","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Progressive Smart Grid System from Both Power and Communications Aspects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Progressive Smart Grid System from Both Power and Communications Aspects","sourcePdf":"10lo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.24986S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6250311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6250311","articleId":"5989902","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5989903,"authors":[{"name":"Sooksan Panichpapiboon","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6250311/5989903/5989903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sooksan Panichpapiboon (S'05-M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.

Generally, each source has a fixed bias and so provides bits with a specific probability of being one. If many different probability values are required, it can be expensive to generate all of these directly from physical sources. This paper demonstrates novel techniques for synthesizing combinational logic that transforms source probabilities into different target probabilities. We consider three scenarios in terms of whether the source probabilities are specified and whether they can be duplicated. In the case that the source probabilities are not specified and can be duplicated, we provide a specific choice, the set {0.4, 0.5} ; we show how to synthesize logic that transforms probabilities from this set into arbitrary decimal probabilities.

Thermal modeling for microchannel cooling is challenging due to its complicated thermal-wake effect, a localized temperature wake phenomenon downstream of a heated source in the flow. This paper presents a fast and accurate thermal-wake aware thermal model for integrated microchannel 3-D ICs. A combination of the microchannel thermal-wake function and the channel merging technique achieves more than 3300\u00d7 speedup with less than 5% error in comparison with a commercial numerical finite volume simulation tool. With the proposed model, we characterize thermal behaviors of microchannel-cooled 3-D ICs and compare them with the case of conventional air-cooled 3-D ICs. We also demonstrate thermal-aware placements using our thermal model. It shows that the proposed model can be used to reduce peak temperatures, which is considered important for 3-D IC designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Modeling and Analysis for 3-D ICs With Integrated Microchannel Cooling","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2144596","endPage":"1306","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5989977/05989994.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2144596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5989994","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microchannel","Integrated circuit modeling","Heating","Solid modeling","Numerical models","Solids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","finite volume methods","heat sinks","integrated circuit modelling","microchannel flow","thermal stresses","three-dimensional integrated circuits","wakes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal modeling","integrated microchannel liquid-cooling technology","thermal stress","thermal wake effect","localized temperature wake phenomenon","3D stacked IC","integrated microchannel 3D IC","microchannel thermal wake function","numerical finite volume simulation tool","thermal aware placement","3D IC design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D ICs","microchannel","placement","thermal-wakes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Modeling and Analysis for 3-D ICs With Integrated Microchannel Cooling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5989994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","volume":"30","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5989994/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12181859","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Modeling and Analysis for 3-D ICs With Integrated Microchannel Cooling","sourcePdf":"tcad-yang-2144596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100056S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5989977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5989977","articleId":"5989994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"}]
