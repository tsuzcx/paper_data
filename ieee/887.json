The Multi-level Quadrature Amplitude Modulation demodulator performance sensitive to the phase error of the received signal. The demodulator at the receiver is in these estimates, and the sensitivity increases as multi-level increases. The phase error of received signal impacts on constellation diagram and increases bit error ratio. Simulated results in Additive White Gaussian Noise channel and Rayleigh channel show that there are two major factor impact on the phase error: characteristics of environmental communication and the number of level M of quadrature amplitude modulated signal. Specially, phase errors are vigorously affected by fading noise with Doppler shift.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Military Technologies (ICMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863088/8870012/08870078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Military Technologies (ICMT)","doi":"10.1109/MILTECHS.2019.8870078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILTECHS.2019.8870078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Error Analysis of M-QAM Demodulation in Satellite Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Demodulation","AWGN channels","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Receivers","Error probability","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","demodulation","demodulators","Doppler shift","error analysis","error statistics","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error ratio","quadrature amplitude modulated signal","phase error analysis","M-QAM demodulation","satellite channel","Multilevel Quadrature Amplitude Modulation demodulator performance","received signal","additive white Gaussian noise channel","Rayleigh channel","environmental communication","fading noise","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","constellation diagram","satellite communication","fading channel","Doppler effect"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Phase Error Analysis of M-QAM Demodulation in Satellite Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8870078/","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"19078479","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","conferenceDate":"30-31 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Error Analysis of M-QAM Demodulation in Satellite Channel","confLoc":"Brno, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066134S","chronDate":"30-31 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863088","isNumber":"8870012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863088","xplore-issue":"8870012","articleId":"8870078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8870193,"authors":[{"name":"Haoyu Zhuang","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8952842/8870193/zhuan-2945247-small.gif","p":["Haoyu Zhuang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Microelectronics, Xidian University, China, in 2010 and 2017, respectively.","He was a Researcher with The University of Texas at Austin, from 2014 to 2016.

To face the challenge, in this article, we propose a novel SOH prediction method based on transfer learning. The long short-term memory (LSTM) combined with fully connected (FC) layers is designed as the base model. The LSTM can learn the long-term dependencies of battery aging to reduce the noise sensitivity of the prediction model, and the FC layers serve as the \u201cfirewall\u201d during the transferring process. A feature expression scoring (FES) rule is developed to assess the relevance of multiple prediction tasks. Different from traditional transfer learning, we select the task with the highest FES score to obtain the base model with superior generalization performance. During transfer learning, the fine-tuning strategy is executed for the tasks with high scores, but rebuilding strategy for the low score one. Only using the first 25% of a dataset for transfer training, our technique can predict more phases compared to traditional data-driven methods, which will avoid more unreasonable operations from users. The experimental results verify that the proposed method can achieve accurate, fast, and steady SOH prediction. Compared to some existing data-driven methods, our method obtains optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2019.2946551","startPage":"8723","endPage":"8731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2019.2946551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9123771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/9123771/08870196.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer Learning With Long Short-Term Memory Network for State-of-Health Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870196/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Transfer Learning With Long Short-Term Memory Network for State-of-Health Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries","volume":"67","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8870196/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19727953","publicationDate":"Oct. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501428"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Department of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2018H0043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer Learning With Long Short-Term Memory Network for State-of-Health Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries","sourcePdf":"tie-tan-2946551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077655S","chronDate":"Oct.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"9123771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"9123771","articleId":"8870196","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":8870200,"authors":[{"name":"Ashok Bandi","affiliation":["SnT, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8870200/bandi-2946161-small.gif","p":["Ashok Bandi (S\u201918) was born in Kunkalagunta, India, in 1988.

Unlike the previous works which do not offer a truly joint design, this paper focuses on formulating a problem amenable for the joint update of scheduling and precoding. Novel optimization formulations are investigated to reveal the hidden difference of convex/ concave structure for three classical criteria (weighted sum rate, max-min signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, and power minimization) and associated constraints are considered. Thereafter, we propose a convex-concave procedure framework based iterative algorithm where scheduling and precoding variables are updated jointly in each iteration. Finally, we show the superiority in performance of joint solution over the state-of-the-art designs through Monte-Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Solution for Scheduling and Precoding in Multiuser MISO Downlink Channels","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2946161","endPage":"490","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08870200.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2946161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870200","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Scheduling","Downlink","Complexity theory","MISO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","concave programming","convex programming","iterative methods","minimax techniques","MISO communication","Monte Carlo methods","multiuser channels","precoding","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel optimization formulations","max-min signal-to-interference","convex-concave procedure framework","scheduling","precoding variables","joint solution","multiuser MISO downlink channels","base station","interference management","joint update","Monte-Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["User scheduling","precoding","multiuser","difference-of-convex","convex-concave procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Solution for Scheduling and Precoding in Multiuser MISO Downlink Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870200/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8870200/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19262633","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Luxembourg National Fund FNR","grantNumber":"C-PPP16/IS/11504382/PROSAT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Solution for Scheduling and Precoding in Multiuser MISO Downlink Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-bandi-2946161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109899S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8870200","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8870205,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Luo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8959427/8870205/luo-2943287-small.gif","p":["Qing Luo (S\u201917) was born in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China, in 1992.

In the proposed DPD for hybrid beamforming with regular matrix array, all subarrays share an integrated linear crosstalk model (ICTM) block, a signal decomposition (SD) block, and a single receiver (SR) to reduce hardware complexity and cost greatly. Subarray coupling coefficients can be identified for the ICTM block without direct measurements. Using the SD block, receiving-end signals can be distinguished as feedback signals for each subarray from one feedback signal from SR. The receiving-end signals for each subarray can be linearized by a modified dual-input predistorter as per the distinguished feedback signals. For the special case of fully digital beamforming, the proposed DPD is the same as for hybrid beamforming. Simulation of eight-subarray hybrid beamforming transmitter is given to validate how the proposed DPD scales to mMIMO scenarios. Experimental results of three-subarray hybrid beamforming transmitter are provided, which indicate that the proposed DPD can achieve the similar linearization performance with less complexity, compared with the state-of-the-art dual-input with crosstalk and mismatch model (DI-CTMM) DPD.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Receiver Over-the-Air Digital Predistortion for Massive MIMO Transmitters With Antenna Crosstalk","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2019.2943287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8959427/08870205.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2019.2943287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959427","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Single-Receiver Over-the-Air Digital Predistortion for Massive MIMO Transmitters With Antenna Crosstalk","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8870205/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19260789","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601117, 61671149, 61861136002 and 61701110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Receiver Over-the-Air Digital Predistortion for Massive MIMO Transmitters With Antenna Crosstalk","sourcePdf":"tmtt-luo-2943287-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.221728S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8959427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8959427","articleId":"8870205","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8870206,"authors":[{"name":"Peiming Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8870206/li-2946153-small.gif","p":["Peiming Li (S\u201918) received the B.E. degree from the Guangdong University of Technology, China, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information Engineering.

We consider a linear topology scenario, where these users locate in a straight line and the UAV flies at a fixed altitude above the line connecting them. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the one-dimensional (1D) UAV trajectory and wireless resource allocation to reveal the fundamental rate limits of the UAV-enabled MAC, under the users' individual maximum power constraints and the UAV's maximum flight speed constraints. First, we consider the capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission with successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the UAV receiver. In this case, we characterize the capacity region by maximizing the average sum-rate of all users subject to a set of rate profile constraints. To optimally solve this highly non-convex problem with infinitely many UAV location variables over time, we show that any speed-constrained UAV trajectory is equivalent to the combination of a maximum-speed flying trajectory and a speed-free trajectory, and accordingly transform the original speed-constrained trajectory optimization problem into a speed-free problem that is optimally solvable via the Lagrange dual decomposition. It is rigorously proved that the optimal 1D trajectory solution follows the successive hover-and-fly (SHF) structure, i.e., the UAV successively hovers above a number of optimized locations, and flies unidirectionally among them at the maximum speed. Next, we consider two orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission schemes, i.e., frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA). We maximize the achievable rate regions in the two cases by jointly optimizing the 1D trajectory design and wireless resource (frequency/time) allocation. It is shown that the optimal trajectory solutions still follow the SHF structure but with different hovering locations for each scheme. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed optimal trajectory designs achieve considerable rate gains over other benchmark schemes, and the capacity region achieved by NOMA significantly outperforms the rate regions by FDMA and TDMA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19262618","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8870206/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Rate Limits of UAV-Enabled Multiple Access Channel With Trajectory Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871137"},{"fundingName":"National Key Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1800800"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Key Area Research Development Program","grantNumber":"2018B030338001"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Basic Research Program (Natural Science)","grantNumber":"2018KZDXM028"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2019D08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Rate Limits of UAV-Enabled Multiple Access Channel With Trajectory Optimization","sourcePdf":"twc-lee-2946153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137217S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8870206","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8870208,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo S.

In recent years, the oil and gas industry has increased its interest in applying machine learning to accelerate the seismic interpretation process, which is regarded as a time-consuming and human-centered task. Although machine learning has been successfully used in many applications ranging from stratigraphic segmentation to salt dome detection, a usual bottleneck is the need for a large amount of high-quality annotated data. To overcome this, data augmentation approaches are commonly used, and one of the most powerful is synthetic data generation. In addition, sketch-based synthetic seismic images can be used to support image retrieval applications to help oil companies leverage petabytes of seismic data sets. In this context, this letter investigates the generation of synthetic seismic images based on sketches using generative adversarial networks (GANs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose such an approach. Experiments with five different sketch types in a public seismic data set indicate that realistic seismic images can be synthesized using rather simple sketches.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2019.2945680","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/9145892/08870208.pdf","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2019.2945680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9145892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating Sketch-Based Synthetic Seismic Images With Generative Adversarial Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Generating Sketch-Based Synthetic Seismic Images With Generative Adversarial Networks","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2020","accessionNumber":"19809092","publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8870208/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating Sketch-Based Synthetic Seismic Images With Generative Adversarial Networks","sourcePdf":"lgrs-ferreira-2945680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11458S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"9145892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","xplore-issue":"9145892","articleId":"8870208","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8870210,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa F.

Such architectures incorporate computing functionalities inside memory arrays to make better use of the large internal memory bandwidth, thereby, avoiding frequent data movements. In-DRAM computing architectures offer high throughput and energy improvements in accelerating modern data-intensive applications like machine learning etc. In this manuscript, we propose a vector addition methodology inside DRAM arrays through functional read enabled on local word-lines. The proposed primitive performs majority-based addition operations by storing data in transposed manner. Majority functions are achieved in DRAM cells by activating odd number of rows simultaneously. The proposed majority based bit-serial addition enables huge parallelism and high throughput. We validate the robustness of the proposed in-DRAM computing methodology under process variations to ascertain its reliability. Energy evaluation of the proposed scheme shows 21.7X improvement compared to normal data read operations in standard DDR3-1333 interface. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art in-DRAM compute proposals, the proposed scheme provides one of the fastest addition mechanisms with low area overhead (<; 1% of DRAM chip area). Our system evaluation running the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm on the MNIST handwritten digit classification dataset shows 11.5X performance improvement compared to a conventional von-Neumann machine.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2945617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2945617","startPage":"155","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8952842/08870210.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Memory Low-Cost Bit-Serial Addition Using Commodity DRAM Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"In-Memory Low-Cost Bit-Serial Addition Using Commodity DRAM Technology","volume":"67","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19265607","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8870210/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Memory Low-Cost Bit-Serial Addition Using Commodity DRAM Technology","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ali-2945617-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117734S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8952842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8952842","articleId":"8870210","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8870212,"authors":[{"name":"Rory Coulter","affiliation":["School of Software and Electrical Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/9119488/8870212/coult-2940940-small.gif","p":["Rory Coulter received the bachelor\u2019s degree (Hons.) in information technology from Deakin University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

Traditional approaches resorting to manually defined rules are gradually replaced by automated approaches empowered by machine learning. This revolution is accelerated by huge datasets which support machine-learning models with outstanding performance. In the context of a data-driven paradigm, this article reviews recent analytic research on cyber traffic over social networks and the Internet by using a set of common concepts of similarity, correlation, and collective indication, and by sharing security goals for classifying network host or applications and users or Tweets. The ability to do so is not determined in isolation, but rather drawn for a wide use of many different network or social flows. Furthermore, the flows exhibit many characteristics, such as fixed sized and multiple messages between source and destination. This article demonstrates a new research methodology of data-driven cyber security (DDCS) and its application in social and Internet traffic analysis. The framework of the DDCS methodology consists of three components, that is, cyber security data processing, cyber security feature engineering, and cyber security modeling. Challenges and future directions in this field are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","volume":"50","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"19687833","pubMedId":"31634146","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2020","publicationDate":"July 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8870212/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Cyber Security in Perspective\u2014Intelligent Traffic Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Linkage Project","grantNumber":"LP170100924"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP160103567"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Cyber Security in Perspective\u2014Intelligent Traffic Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcyb-xiang-2940940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160257S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"9119488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"9119488","articleId":"8870212","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8870236,"authors":[{"name":"Guangxu Zhu","affiliation":["The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8870236/zhu-2946245-small.gif","p":["Guangxu Zhu (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Zhejiang University and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong, all in electronic and electrical engineering.

While computing speeds are advancing rapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge learning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low-latency multi-access scheme for edge learning. To this end, we consider a popular privacy-preserving framework, federated edge learning (FEEL), where a global AI-model at an edge-server is updated by aggregating (averaging) local models trained at edge devices. It is proposed that the updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over broadband channels should be analog aggregated \u201cover-the-air\u201d by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. Such broadband analog aggregation (BAA) results in dramatical communication-latency reduction compared with the conventional orthogonal access (i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the effects of BAA on learning performance are quantified targeting a single-cell random network. First, we derive two tradeoffs between communication-and-learning metrics, which are useful for network planning and optimization. The power control (\u201ctruncated channel inversion\u201d) required for BAA results in a tradeoff between the update-reliability [as measured by the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] and the expected update-truncation ratio. Consider the scheduling of cell-interior devices to constrain path loss. This gives rise to the other tradeoff between the receive SNR and fraction of data exploited in learning.

In order to reduce power dissipation, decreasing the supply voltage is a promising way. However, soft errors and decreased supply voltage make circuits behave probabilistic. Fortunately, some applications can tolerate a certain level of operation errors. The tradeoff between energy and reliability provides an opportunity to save the power consumption in the circuit. An asymptotically linear analysis (ALA) strategy is proposed to model the reliability evaluation of combinational logic circuits. Under the assumption that the gate error probability is not more than 0.05, an asymptotic linear matrix A is constructed by using the first-order term of the output error probability. When propagating the gate error probability from the input to the output ports, the ALA strategy only requires one multiplication between the matrix A and the gate error probability vector. There are significant differences in the complexity of computation of the ALA scheme and the Bayesian network (BN) and the probability transfer matrix (PTM) schemes, while its relative error (RE) is no more than 0.08 on the benchmark of LGSynth91. Furthermore, three schemes are proposed to adjust the gate error probability to meet the constraint on the error probability of the probabilistic CMOS (PCMOS) circuit's outputs. The proposed schemes can be performed to search the gate error probability combinations in the logic and circuit design stage of VLSI. During the power optimization, the switching activity factor in the asymptotically linear region is approximately invariant. It makes the power optimal model convex. The energy-saving ratio of the proposed power optimization scheme is 5%-6% higher than the existing schemes. The time consumption of the proposed three schemes is one-thousandth of the time consumed by the BN and PTM schemes. All the three schemes are verified by conducting experiments on the ISCAS'85 and IWLS'15 benchmark circuits. The simulation results establish the feasibility of the ALA and the performance of the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2945083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale

article, we present a simple, yet energy- and area-efficient method for tolerating the stuck-at faults caused by an endurance issue in secure-resistive main memories. In the proposed method, by employing the random characteristics of the encrypted data encoded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as well as a rotational shift operation, a large number of memory locations with stuck-at faults could be employed for correctly storing the data. Due to the simple hardware implementation of the proposed method, its energy consumption is considerably smaller than that of other recently proposed methods. The technique may be employed along with other error correction methods, including the error correction code (ECC) and the error correction pointer (ECP). To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, it is implemented in a phase-change memory (PCM)based main memory system and compared with three error tolerating methods. The results reveal that for a stuck-at fault occurrence rate of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n and with the uncorrected bit error rate of 2 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n, the proposed method achieves 82% energy reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method.

For safety concerns or transient performance requirements, some state constraints should be guaranteed both theoretically and practically, particularly those exerted on unactuated states. To the best of our knowledge, there are few closed-loop control methods that can treat unactuated state constraints with theoretical guarantees (i.e., that can theoretically guarantee unactuated state variables to be always within the preset ranges). For this purpose, in this article, we propose a new control strategy for a class of underactuated systems that can treat the various constraints including actuated and unactuated state constraints and the constraints on some specific composite variables. Specifically, we elaborately design some new auxiliary terms that are composed of constrained variable signals and actuated velocity signals. These terms can enhance the couplings between unactuated and actuated states that are further utilized to tackle the unactuated state and composite variable constraints. Then, the performance of the designed method is proven by rigorous analysis. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a double pendulum crane system and a tower crane system to verify its superior performance by experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2019.2946541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9090028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2019.2946541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/9090028/08870254.pdf","startPage":"7702","endPage":"7714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Control of Underactuated Systems Subject to Both Actuated and Unactuated State Constraints With Experimental Verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Control of Underactuated Systems Subject to Both Actuated and Unactuated State Constraints With Experimental Verification","volume":"67","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2020","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8870254/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2020","accessionNumber":"19685011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870254/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61903120, 61873134 and U1706228"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin","grantNumber":"TJSQNTJ-2017-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Control of Underactuated Systems Subject to Both Actuated and Unactuated State Constraints With Experimental Verification","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2946541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14497S","chronDate":"Sept.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"9090028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"9090028","articleId":"8870254","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8870255,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0002-6891-8059","id":"37087103935"},{"name":"Zhiyong Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-8043-0312","id":"37335976500"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC), Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085358759"},{"name":"Kaylena A.

Accurate assessment of FoG is critical for the management of PD and to evaluate the efficacy of treatments. Currently, the assessment of FoG requires well-trained experts to perform time-consuming annotations via vision-based observations. Thus, automatic FoG detection algorithms are needed. In this study, we formulate vision-based FoG detection, as a fine-grained graph sequence modelling task, by representing the anatomic joints in each temporal segment with a directed graph, since FoG events can be observed through the motion patterns of joints. A novel deep learning method is proposed, namely graph sequence recurrent neural network (GS-RNN), to characterize the FoG patterns by devising graph recurrent cells, which take graph sequences of dynamic structures as inputs. For the cases of which prior edge annotations are not available, a data-driven based adjacency estimation method is further proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on vision-based FoG detection using deep neural networks designed for graph sequences of dynamic structures. Experimental results on more than 150 videos collected from 45 patients demonstrated promising performance of the proposed GS-RNN for FoG detection with an AUC value of 0.90.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2019.2946469","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1901","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8835130/08870255.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2019.2946469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8835130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph Sequence Recurrent Neural Network for Vision-Based Freezing of Gait Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Deep learning","Recurrent neural networks","Task analysis","Feature extraction","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","directed graphs","diseases","gait analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","medical disorders","medical image processing","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-based freezing","gait detection","PD","vision-based FoG detection","fine-grained graph sequence modelling task","directed graph","FoG patterns","graph recurrent cells","data-driven based adjacency estimation method","deep neural networks","graph sequence recurrent neural network","Parkinson's disease","freezing of gait","deep learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parkinson\u2019s disease","freezing of gait detection","deep learning","recurrent neural network","graph sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","displayDocTitle":"Graph Sequence Recurrent Neural Network for Vision-Based Freezing of Gait Detection","volume":"29","htmlLink":"/document/8870255/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2020","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2019","accessionNumber":"19165509","pubMedId":"31634131","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP160103675"},{"fundingName":"NHMRC-ARC Dementia Fellowship","grantNumber":"1110414"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000925","fundingName":"National Health and Medical Research Council","grantNumber":"\u01421037746"},{"fundingName":"Dementia Research Team","grantNumber":"\u01421095127"},{"fundingName":"NeuroSleepCentre of Research Excellence","grantNumber":"\u01421060992"},{"fundingName":"ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and Its Disorders Memory Program","grantNumber":"CE110001021"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001774","fundingName":"University of Sydney"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61420106015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009307","fundingName":"Parkinson Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph Sequence Recurrent Neural Network for Vision-Based Freezing of Gait Detection","sourcePdf":"tip-hu-2946469-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1523S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8835130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8835130","articleId":"8870255","onlineDate":"15 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8870260,"authors":[{"name":"Dehong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/9090028/8870260/zhou-2946549-small.gif","p":["Dehong Zhou (S\u201914\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in control science and engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2012 and 2016.","From 2016 to 2018, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

However, conventional MPPC (C-MPPC), which only selects one switching state during the entire sampling period, leads to high active and reactive power ripples. Moreover, the heavy computational burden and variable switching frequency limit the applications of MPPC. In this article, vector shifted MPPC (VS-MPPC) methods are investigated. With the shifted vectors, the constant-switching-frequency MPPC of three-level NPC rectifiers can be simplified as that of a two-level rectifier, and the balanced neutral capacitor voltage can be easily achieved by adjusting the duty cycle of the redundant switches without any weighting factor employed. Only eight voltage vectors are calculated and shifted based on the small hexagon selection. Consequently, the computational burden is significantly reduced, even 35% less than that of C-MPPC. Furthermore, the proposed VS-MPPC presents a constant switching frequency and better steady-state control performance without evaluating all the switching states. Simulation and experimental evaluations of the proposed VS-MPPC methods with C-MPPC have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed VS-MPPC methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Understanding user behavior becomes a key enabler in many fields such as sedentary-related healthcare, human-computer interaction and affective computing. Traditional sensor-based and vision-based user behavior analysis approaches are obtrusive in general, hindering their usage in real-world. Therefore, in this article, we first introduce the WiFi signal as a new source instead of sensor and vision for unobtrusive user behaviors analysis. Then we design BeSense, a contactless behavior analysis system leveraging signal processing and computational intelligence over WiFi channel state information. We prototype BeSense on commodity low-cost WiFi devices and evaluate its performance in real-world environments.

For large-scale geo-distributed systems, determining how to appropriately introduce intelligence in networking is the key to high-efficiency operation. In this treatise, we explore two deployment paradigms (centralized vs. distributed) for AI-based networking. To achieve the best results, we propose a hybrid ML paradigm that combines a distributed intelligence, based on units called \"AI routers,\" with a centralized intelligence, called the \"network mind\", to support different network services. In the proposed paradigm, we deploy centralized AI control for connection-oriented tunneling-based routing protocols (such as multiprotocol label switching and segment routing) to guarantee a high QoS, whereas for hop-by-hop IP routing, we shift the intelligent control responsibility to each AI router to ease the overhead imposed by centralized control and use the network mind to improve the global convergence.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2019.2937609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2019.2937609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/10207/8870219/08870277.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AI Routers & Network Mind: A Hybrid Machine Learning Paradigm for Packet Routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"AI Routers & Network Mind: A Hybrid Machine Learning Paradigm for Packet Routing","volume":"14","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8870277/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","accessionNumber":"19061803","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870277/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AI Routers & Network Mind: A Hybrid Machine Learning Paradigm for Packet Routing","sourcePdf":"14mci04-yao-2937609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072424S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"8870219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8870219","articleId":"8870277","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8870292,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5044-6124-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8870292","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Industrial & Commercial Power Systems of the IEEE Industry Applications Society"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870292","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE Standards","Circuit breakers","Substations","Arc discharges","Relays","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","electric fuses","IEEE standards","industrial power systems","power system faults","power system protection","power transformers","substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switchgear","commercial power systems","fault protection strategies","substation bus","IEEE","fault isolation strategies","industrial power systems","circuit breakers","fuses","disconnecting devices","transformers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["arc flash","arc flash protection","differential protection","double-ended substation","high impedance bus differential relay","IEEE 3004.11\u2122","percentage differential relay","tie circuit breaker"]}],"abstract":"Covered in this recommended practice is the protection of bus and switchgear used in industrial and commercial power systems.

However, increasing the inter-element spacing may result in the appearance of grating lobes in the field-of-view (FoV). In this paper, 0.05-outage capacity is used as the performance metric to optimize the inter-element spacing for a given array size in line-of-sight scenarios. For the case of two users, we propose to increase the inter-element spacing as long as the 0.05-outage capacity does not reduce more than 1% compared to the capacity achieved when the two users have orthogonal channel vectors. Radiated power at the base station is adjusted to have the same effective isotropic radiated power for different arrays. Simulation results for an array size of 40\u03bb show that for FoVs of 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0, the inter-element spacing can be increased from 0.5\u03bb to more than 1.14\u03bb.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2019.8870356","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019

For high values of the tunneling magnetoresistance, this description is not accurate anymore, and one needs to solve the spin and charge drift-diffusion equations in the whole structure self-consistently. We compute the switching time distribution obtained by the self-consistent model and compare it to the switching times from the fixed current density approach.

Meanwhile, the enhanced DOF results in a higher spatial resolution of the radar in the context of DOA estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-Sparse Radars for Enhanced DOA Estimation of Spatio-Temporal Correlated Sources","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2019.8870432","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863435/8870350/08870432.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2019.8870432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870350","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-Sparse Radars for Enhanced DOA Estimation of Spatio-Temporal Correlated Sources","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8870432/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19078573","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-Sparse Radars for Enhanced DOA Estimation of Spatio-Temporal Correlated Sources","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049176S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863435","isNumber":"8870350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863435","xplore-issue":"8870350","articleId":"8870432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8870449,"authors":[{"name":"Yanki Aslan","affiliation":["MS3 Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yanki","lastName":"Aslan","id":"37086320394"},{"name":"Jan Puskely","affiliation":["MS3 Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Puskely","id":"37601342600"},{"name":"Antoine Roederer","affiliation":["MS3 Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Roederer","id":"37276969200"},{"name":"Alexander Yarovoy","affiliation":["MS3 Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Yarovoy","id":"37273743500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0566-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0565-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0567-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8870449","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"abstract":"A novel hybrid beamforming architecture based on a phased array of active multiport subarrays is proposed for multi-user 5G applications.

To provide insights into EE optimization issues, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed as an effective technique. First, we adopt a flexible and generalized three-dimensional (3D) angle of arrival (AOA) model to account for realistic propagation environments. Then we derive a novel closed-form spatial correlation function (SCF) relevant to the locations of antenna array elements in the 3D space. In this paper, we incorporate our SCF into the EE derivation and apply the PSO algorithm to find the optimal antenna array topology in space that maximizes the EE. The derived EE is significantly higher compared to existing state-of-the art research that employed an exponential SCF. We provide new insights into EE maximization for antenna arrays, where the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2019.8870504","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863435/8870350/08870504.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"191","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas

semiconductor industry. Furthermore, processing large data has highlighted the limitations of the von Neumann architecture. To overcome this, different types of memory devices like Resistive Random-Access Memories (RRAMs) have also gained a lot of importance. Hence, carrier dynamics in oxides has gained significant traction in recent years. In this work, we discuss the kinetic Monte Carlo methodology as implemented in our integrated simulation environment NESS (Nano-Electronic Simulation Software) that allows us to study carrier transport in the oxide using accurate physics based models. As an example, we study the retention characteristics in a molecule based flash memory.","doi":"10.1109/SISPAD.2019.8870518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SISPAD.2019.8870518","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863874/8870352/08870518.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Modeling of Charge Trapping in Molecule Based Flash Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Modeling of Charge Trapping in Molecule Based Flash Memories","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8870518/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19078776","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870518/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Modeling of Charge Trapping in Molecule Based Flash Memories","confLoc":"Udine, Italy","sourcePdf":"279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065428S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863874","isNumber":"8870352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863874","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8870352","articleId":"8870518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":8870520,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Rostand","affiliation":["DPHY, ONERA, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Rostand","id":"37086223948"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Martinie","affiliation":["DCOS, CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Martinie","id":"37543189900"},{"name":"Joris Lacord","affiliation":["DCOS, CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Joris","lastName":"Lacord","id":"37887883400"},{"name":"Olivier Rozeau","affiliation":["DCOS, CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Rozeau","id":"37322363500"},{"name":"Thierry Poiroux","affiliation":["DCOS, CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Poiroux","id":"37268372400"},{"name":"Guillaume Hubert","affiliation":["DPHY, ONERA, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Hubert","id":"37283251600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0940-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0939-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0941-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1577"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-1569"}],"articleNumber":"8870520","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"abstract":"Single Event Transients (SET) are ionizing particles induced current pulses which are able to generate soft errors in CMOS circuits. In Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technologies, bipolar amplification phenomena is more significant due to presence of the Burried Oxide (BOX), which is detrimental to soft errors sensitivity. State of the art FDSOI SET models account for bipolar amplification through a dynamic pre-factor. This approach is mainly empirical and not compact. In this work, we propose a SET compact model for FDSOI MOSFETs including a physical modeling of bipolar amplification. Results are validated through TCAD simulations. A circuit level approach is proposed considering arbitrary generation within functional SRAM cell. This approach allows more realistic Single Event Upset (SEU) prediction and we show how circuit level generation can influence SEU prediction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Silicon-on-insulator","Discharges (electric)","Semiconductor device modeling","MOSFET","Fault location"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","radiation hardening (electronics)","semiconductor device models","silicon-on-insulator","technology CAD (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDSOI MOSFET","circuit level arbitrary generation","single event transients","current pulses","CMOS circuits","silicon-on-insulator technologies","bipolar amplification phenomena","soft errors sensitivity","SET compact model","circuit level approach","circuit level generation","realistic single event upset prediction","FDSOI SET models","single event transient compact model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SET","Bipolar Amplification","SOI MOSFET","Compact Model","SPICE","TCAD"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SISPAD.2019.8870520","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863874/8870352/08870520.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SISPAD.2019.8870520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Event Transient Compact Model for FDSOI MOSFETs Taking Bipolar Amplification and Circuit Level Arbitrary Generation Into Account","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single Event Transient Compact Model for FDSOI MOSFETs Taking Bipolar Amplification and Circuit Level Arbitrary Generation Into Account","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870520/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8870520/","accessionNumber":"19078811","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Event Transient Compact Model for FDSOI MOSFETs Taking Bipolar Amplification and Circuit Level Arbitrary Generation Into Account","confLoc":"Udine, Italy","sourcePdf":"222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058575S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863874","isNumber":"8870352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863874","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8870352","articleId":"8870520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8870521,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Cheol Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Cheol","lastName":"Han","id":"37087046898"},{"name":"Sung-Min Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Min","lastName":"Hong","id":"37404680000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0940-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0939-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0941-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1577"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-1569"}],"articleNumber":"8870521","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Electric potential","Electrostatics","Doping","Newton method","Training","Semiconductor process modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatics","neural nets","Newton-Raphson method","nonlinear equations","Poisson equation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterations","nonlinear Poisson equation","Newton-Raphson loop","pn diodes","semiconductor device","initial electrostatic potential profile","deep neural network","trained neural network","training phase","electrostatic potential profiles","numerical solutions","doping densities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","Initial electrostatic potential","Newton-Raphson method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870521","abstract":"A deep neural network is trained to learn the electrostatic potential of the semiconductor device.

The optical problem is solved thanks to Finite-Differences Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations, while solution to the carriers motion problem is given through the application of the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). This method is presented as a faster alternative to the coupled use of FDTD and TCAD simulations: since it is supposed that the two problem solutions are independent, the two simulations can be performed in parallel.

Due to the great loss in error correction performance of EMS algorithm, in this paper, we establish constraints to obtain reliable nodes while decoding and evaluate the reliability of the nodes. The nodes and information transferred between nodes are processed and optimized according to the reliability of the nodes. High reliability nodes will not be updated in the decoding process while the information of the sub-reliability nodes will be optimized in different situations, thereby improving the decoding accuracy. This algorithm can accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, while the reduced number of update nodes can control the increase of the computation to a certain extent, and maintain the advantage of the low computation quantity of EMS algorithm. Through simulation results and computational analysis, we prove that the improved algorithm has significantly improved error correction performance compared with the traditional EMS algorithm. Under the same conditions, it has completely entered the waterfall area at 3.6dB, and the EMS algorithm has not entered the waterfall area. By comparing the average iteration times of decoding of the two algorithms, the convergence speed of the algorithm can be reflected. Compared with EMS algorithm, the improved algorithm has significantly improved the convergence speed in most areas, which indicates that the processing of sub-reliable nodes accelerates the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, the average update times of the check nodes and variable nodes of the two algorithms are compared respectively. Although the improved algorithm introduces extra processing flow, it speeds up the convergence of the algorithm, and the computational cost of decoding is less expensive.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2019.8870565","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863435/8870350/08870565.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2019.8870565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Extended Min-Sum Algorithm for Non-Binary LDPC Codes Based on Node Reliability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Improved Extended Min-Sum Algorithm for Non-Binary LDPC Codes Based on Node Reliability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870565/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19078582","htmlLink":"/document/8870565/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Extended Min-Sum Algorithm for Non-Binary LDPC Codes Based on Node Reliability","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.177256S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863435","isNumber":"8870350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863435","xplore-issue":"8870350","articleId":"8870565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8870568,"authors":[{"name":"Spyridon N.

The last decade, backscatter communication has been introduced as a cutting-edge technology that could address the above limitations. In high precision agricultural applications, the monitoring of plant-water-stress (PWS) is of high importance for smart sensing. Instead of the traditional ground soil moisture sensing, leaf sensing is an old technology, which is used for the detection of PWS. Considering the above topics, this work aims to mention the development of a novel sensor node/tag for environmental leaf sensing which uses backscattering communication over ambient frequency modulated signals (FM music signals). The work is based on our previous works [1], [2] and it is described how ambient backscatter technology could be exploited for the \u201cone sensor/plant\u201d concept in precision agriculture applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2019.8870568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870350","startPage":"201","endPage":"201","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863435/8870350/08870568.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Cost Ambient Backscatter for Agricultural Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8870568/","displayDocTitle":"Low Cost Ambient Backscatter for Agricultural Applications","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19078610","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Cost Ambient Backscatter for Agricultural Applications","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"373_up.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044827S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863435","isNumber":"8870350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863435","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8870350","articleId":"8870568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8870673,"authors":[{"name":"Kirti Sharma","affiliation":["BrainLinks-BrainTools Cluster of Excellence, University of Freiburg, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Kirti","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086130592"},{"name":"Sahana Dholipet Nagendra Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), Microsystem Materials Laboratory"],"firstName":"Sahana Dholipet Nagendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37087049636"},{"name":"Oliver Paul","affiliation":["BrainLinks-BrainTools Cluster of Excellence, University of Freiburg, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Paul","id":"37300124500"},{"name":"Patrick Ruther","affiliation":["BrainLinks-BrainTools Cluster of Excellence, University of Freiburg, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Ruther","id":"37298087500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1610-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1609-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1611-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1968"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"8870673","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870673","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Etching","Silicon","Microfluidics","Fabrication","Micromechanical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","biomedical materials","bioMEMS","drug delivery systems","elemental semiconductors","grinding","microelectrodes","microfabrication","microfluidics","silicon","sputter etching","surface roughness","xenon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated channels","minimally invasive drug delivery","microfluidic probes","etching-before-grinding approach","controlled etch process","microchannels","etch openings","process parameters","etch rate","etch anisotropy","microfluidic neural probes","silicon probes","continuous-flow etching","vapor-phase xenon difluoride etching","plasma-free xenon difluoride etching","continuous-flow xenon difluoride etching","microchannel fabrication","aperture effect","surface roughness","mechanical fracture tests","flow fracture tests","size 70.0 mum","XeF2","Si"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports on the fabrication and characterization of thin silicon (Si) probes with integrated channels for minimally invasive drug delivery into the brain.

Biosignals and human body pressure data achieved through the proposed pressure sensor would be applied to early diagnosis and prevention of diseases such as diabetes and bedsores.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wearable Soft Microfluidic Pressure Sensor Using 3D-Printed Mold for Health Monitoring","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2019.8870758","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863068/8870611/08870758.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2019.8870758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870611","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Jan. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Wearable Soft Microfluidic Pressure Sensor Using 3D-Printed Mold for Health Monitoring","conferenceDate":"27-31 Jan. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8870758/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"19128187","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wearable Soft Microfluidic Pressure Sensor Using 3D-Printed Mold for Health Monitoring","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"pg0853.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092049S","chronDate":"27-31 Jan. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863068","isNumber":"8870611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863068","xplore-issue":"8870611","articleId":"8870758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8870796,"authors":[{"name":"Yansong Yang","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yansong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085867547"},{"name":"Ruochen Lu","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ruochen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085418438"},{"name":"Songbin Gong","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Songbin","lastName":"Gong","id":"37953311000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1610-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1609-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1611-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1968"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"8870796","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Lithium niobate","5G mobile communication","Couplings","Micromechanical devices","Electric fields","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bulk acoustic wave devices","lithium compounds","microwave resonators","Q-factor","surface acoustic wave resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromechanical coupling","quality factor","spurious-free response","phase velocity","first-order antisymmetric Lamb wave mode","spurious mode suppression","thin-film bulk acoustic resonators","A1 mode lithium niobate resonator","Y-cut lithium niobate thin film","electrode optimization","surface acoustic wave resonators","fifth-generation front-end filtering","frequency 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz","LiNbO3"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports on the demonstration of a 1.65 GHz A1 mode lithium niobate resonator with a high electromechanical coupling (k\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) of 14%, a high-quality factor ( Q) of 3112, and a near spurious-free response.

The use of this L-network is disruptive over the conventional use of a single series resonator and provides more than 30% gain improvement. The proposed technique requires two identical resonators and is robust against frequency variations. Finally, it requires the use of smaller resonators for a given capacitive load, making it further immune to gain variations experienced when using large parallel arrays of resonators.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2019.8870891","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","startPage":"867","endPage":"870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2019.8870891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870611","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863068/8870611/08870891.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Micromechanical devices","Capacitance","Performance evaluation","Envelope detectors","Radio frequency","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium compounds","low-power electronics","micromechanical resonators","Q-factor","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lithium Niobate series-parallel resonator configuration boosts passive","series-parallel configuration","L-network","passive voltage amplification","WuRx","passive voltage gain","capacitive input impedance","X-cut LN resonators","series-parallel network","single series resonator","asynchronous wake-up radio receivers","x-cut lithium niobate microelectromechanical resonators","voltage 46.0 V","frequency 50.0 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"X-Cut Lithium Niobate Series-Parallel Resonator Configuration Boosts Passive Voltage Amplification for Wake-Up Receivers to 46 V/V","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870891/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8870891/","accessionNumber":"19078333","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","conferenceDate":"27-31 Jan. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Jan. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-Cut Lithium Niobate Series-Parallel Resonator Configuration Boosts Passive Voltage Amplification for Wake-Up Receivers to 46 V/V","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"pg0867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046361S","chronDate":"27-31 Jan. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863068","isNumber":"8870611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863068","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8870611","articleId":"8870891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8870923,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Regier","affiliation":["Humanoid Robots Lab, University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Regier","id":"37086204530"},{"name":"Ibrahim Shareef","affiliation":["Humanoid Robots Lab, University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Shareef","id":"37087046237"},{"name":"Maren Bennewitz","affiliation":["Humanoid Robots Lab, University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Maren","lastName":"Bennewitz","id":"37324765000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3605-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3604-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3606-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8870923","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870923","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel, efficient approach to improve the acceleration commands computed by the popular social force model (SFM) [1] for navigation through pedestrian crowds.

In this step, we modify the steering acceleration commands from the SFM according to a set of discrete alterations and simulate the motion of the robot as well as the pedestrians into the future for each alteration. We rate each resulting trajectory based on a cost function and apply the best steering command to the robot. While controlling the robot in such way, we collect for every time step the input and output training data. In the second stage, we then learn a neural network given the collected training data. We use the best acceleration values experienced in the first phase as target values for the neural network and define simple input features describing the local surrounding of the robot. In extensive simulation experiments using different pedestrian densities, we demonstrate that the controls generated by the learned neural network lead to a significantly reduced number of collisions with pedestrians compared to the results of the basic SFM controller, while achieving similar or even shorter completion times.","doi":"10.1109/ECMR.2019.8870923","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863436/8870343/08870923.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECMR.2019.8870923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Navigation with the Social Force Model by Learning a Neural Network Controller in Pedestrian Crowds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Force","Acceleration","Navigation","Collision avoidance","Neural networks","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","object detection","pedestrians"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simple input features","extensive simulation experiments","different pedestrian densities","learned neural network lead","basic SFM controller","improving navigation","neural network controller","pedestrian crowds","popular social force model","simulated approach","steering acceleration commands","discrete alterations","resulting trajectory","cost function","steering command","target values","acceleration values","collected training data","output training data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Improving Navigation with the Social Force Model by Learning a Neural Network Controller in Pedestrian Crowds","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8870923/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19078683","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Navigation with the Social Force Model by Learning a Neural Network Controller in Pedestrian Crowds","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"ECMR_2019_paper_84.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054015S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863436","isNumber":"8870343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863436","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8870343","articleId":"8870923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8870927,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh-Cuong Hoang","affiliation":["Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems (AASS);, Orebro University."],"firstName":"Dinh-Cuong","lastName":"Hoang","id":"37087050264"},{"name":"Todor Stoyanov","affiliation":["Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems (AASS);, Orebro University."],"firstName":"Todor","lastName":"Stoyanov","id":"37601557800"},{"name":"Achim J.

Our framework couples convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, to achieve both high-quality semantic reconstruction as well as robust 6D pose estimation for relevant objects. The method presented in this paper extends a high-quality instance-aware semantic 3D Mapping system from previous work [1] by adding a 6D object pose estimator. While the main trend in CNN-based 6D pose estimation has been to infer object's position and orientation from single views of the scene, our approach explores performing pose estimation from multiple viewpoints, under the conjecture that combining multiple predictions can improve the robustness of an object detection system. The resulting system is capable of producing high-quality object-aware semantic reconstructions of room-sized environments, as well as accurately detecting objects and their 6D poses. The developed method has been verified through experimental validation on the YCB-Video dataset and a newly collected warehouse object dataset.

Although the smoothness of the paths is a major concern in most applications, the widely used sampling-based approaches often produce quirky winding paths. In this paper, we propose a novel path planning algorithm that is able to produce smooth paths, particularly when considering nonholonomic robot kinematics, like the differential drive kinematics. Comparative experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in producing smooth paths.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECMR.2019.8870949","publicationTitle":"2019 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863436/8870343/08870949.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/ECMR.2019.8870949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sampling-Based Algorithm for Planning Smooth Nonholonomic Paths","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Sampling-Based Algorithm for Planning Smooth Nonholonomic Paths","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8870949/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19078714","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870949/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sampling-Based Algorithm for Planning Smooth Nonholonomic Paths","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"ECMR_2019_paper_81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067016S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863436","isNumber":"8870343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863436","xplore-issue":"8870343","articleId":"8870949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8870954,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Majer","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Center, Czech Technical University"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Majer","id":"37086573530"},{"name":"Zhi Yan","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Center, Czech Technical University"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086432956"},{"name":"George Broughton","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Center, Czech Technical University"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Broughton","id":"37086915305"},{"name":"Yassine Ruichek","affiliation":["Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Laboratory (CIAD), University of Technology of Belfort-Montb\u00e9liard (UTBM), France"],"firstName":"Yassine","lastName":"Ruichek","id":"37284281500"},{"name":"Tom\u00e1\u0161 Krajn\u00edk","affiliation":["Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Laboratory (CIAD), University of Technology of Belfort-Montb\u00e9liard (UTBM), France"],"firstName":"Tom\u00e1\u0161","lastName":"Krajn\u00edk","id":"38547272600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3605-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3604-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3606-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8870954","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Robot sensing systems","Three-dimensional displays","Radar detection","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","optical radar","pedestrians","pipelines","radar detection","sensor fusion","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar-based human detection","adverse weather conditions","lifelong-learning multisensor system","pedestrian detection","people detection pipelines","ultrawideband radar","adaptive sensor fusion","radar data classifier","learning-fusion","lidar-based detector failures","thick fog conditions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8870954","doi":"10.1109/ECMR.2019.8870954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECMR.2019.8870954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870343","publicationTitle":"2019 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863436/8870343/08870954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to see through haze: Radar-based Human Detection for Adverse Weather Conditions","abstract":"In this paper, we present a lifelong-learning multisensor system for pedestrian detection in adverse weather conditions.

The calculated pose gives the initial estimation of the camera pose that is the basis for later map construction and path planning. The target of pose estimation is to calculate the relative motion between two frames. The absolute pose of the latter frame can be calculated according to the absolute pose of the previous frame and the relative transformation matrix of the two frames. The main methods for calculating the relative motion of two frames are feature-based method and direct method, and both of them have been successfully applied in various visual SLAM systems. But they all have the disadvantage of needing to carefully adjust the parameters, and sensitive to environment and illumination changes, image blur and other factors. With the great success of deep learning in the field of computer vision, researchers began to explore the use of deep learning methods to solve pose estimation problems. This paper proposes a neural network model for calculating the relative motion of two frames. The training and testing are carried out on a public dataset. The experimental results show that the model shows good performance for known scenes and has certain generalization ability for unknown environments, proving that deep learning methods have the potential to solve the problem of pose estimation.","doi":"10.23919/ChiCC.2019.8870974","pdfPath":"/iel7/8844507/8865119/08870974.pdf","startPage":"8827","endPage":"8832","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2019 Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ChiCC.2019.8870974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8865119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative Pose Estimation of Visual SLAM Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8870974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Relative Pose Estimation of Visual SLAM Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19064165","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8870974/","conferenceDate":"27-30 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative Pose Estimation of Visual SLAM Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065091S","chronDate":"27-30 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8844507","isNumber":"8865119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8844507","xplore-issue":"8865119","articleId":"8870974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8870991,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhamid Riadi","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences Semlalia, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Riadi","id":"37086330779"},{"name":"Mohamed Boulouird","affiliation":["National School of Applied Sciences of Marrakesh(ENSA-M), Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Boulouird","id":"37086333498"},{"name":"Moha M'Rabet Hassani","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences Semlalia, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco"],"firstName":"Moha M'Rabet","lastName":"Hassani","id":"37431931900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1317-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1318-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8870991","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"abstract":"A Least Squares Channel Estimation (LSCE) method is designated for a Massive MIMO system combined with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and higher order modulation technique.

Increasing the number of Bits/symbol provides an increase of BER both the ZF and MMSE detectors for an antennas array 50 \u00d7 100; Whereas increasing the number of OFDM sub-carriers provides a decreasing of BER. Combining 128-QAM modulation with 1024-sub-carriers and increase the receiver antennas array three times (i.e., 50 \u00d7 300), decreases more the BER both the ZF and MMSE detectors.

Rumors can spread among thousands of users immediately without verification and can cause serious damages. Recently, several research studies have been investigated to control online rumors automatically by mining rich text available on the open network with deep learning techniques. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review for rumor detection using deep neural network approaches. A total of 108 studies were retrieved using manual research from five databases (IEEE Explore, Springer Link, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar). The considered studies are then examined in our systematic review to answer the seven research questions that we have formulated to deeply understand the overall trends in the use of deep learning methods for rumor detection. Apart from this, our systematic review also presents the challenges and issues that are faced by the researchers in this area and suggests promising future research directions. Our review will be beneficial for researchers in this domain as it will facilitate researchers' comparison with the existing works due to the availability of a complete description of the used performance matrices, dataset characteristics, and the deep learning model used per each work.

To solve this problem, this study proposes a data-driven approach based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for fast determination of fault event scenarios with uncertainties. The uncertainties include failures and malfunction of relays and circuit breakers (CBs) as well as incomplete/incorrect sensor alarms at the control center. To improve the accuracy for fault event diagnosis, redundant alarms from multiple sources, i.e., Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Sequence of Events Recorders (SERs) are jointly used in this study. The temporal correlation of sensor alarms is incorporated in the constraints of the MILP model. The resulting data-driven algorithm determines the most credible fault scenario that is well supported by the available sensor alarms at the control center. Simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus system, the synthetic South Carolina 500-bus system, and a real-world complex event scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for accurate and efficient fault event diagnosis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Circuit breakers","Phasor measurement units","Relays","Analytical models","Power systems","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alarm systems","circuit breakers","fault diagnosis","integer programming","phasor measurement","power system control","power transmission protection","relay protection","SCADA systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SER","SCADA","PMU","supervisory control and data acquisition","sequence of events recorders","relay failure","data-driven fault event diagnosis","sensor alarms","synthetic South Carolina 500-bus system","IEEE 14-bus system","MILP model","phasor measurement units","control center","circuit breakers","mixed integer linear programming","power system operators","sensor malfunctions","transmission systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alarm message","analytical model","data-driven","fault diagnosis","mixed integer linear programming","outage management","power system protection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2947671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/8964030/08871115.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8964030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2947671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Event Diagnosis in Transmission Systems With Incomplete and Conflicting Alarms Given Sensor Malfunctions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Event Diagnosis in Transmission Systems With Incomplete and Conflicting Alarms Given Sensor Malfunctions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871115/","volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8871115/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19282154","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1329666 and CNS-1840192"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Event Diagnosis in Transmission Systems With Incomplete and Conflicting Alarms Given Sensor Malfunctions","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-jiang-2947671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093201S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"8964030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8964030","articleId":"8871115","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8871116,"authors":[{"name":"Yuwen Qian","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/9040688/8871116/qian-2947773-small.gif","p":["Yuwen Qian received the Ph.D. degree in automatic engineering from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2011, where he was a Lecturer from July 2002 to April 2019, and he is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Electronic and Optical Engineering.

A crucial issue in PLC networks is how to achieve reliable transmission for rural and remote users against severe fading and impulsive noise in an economic way. To address this problem, we propose a cache-enabled multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) PLC network to improve transmission reliability and minimize downloading cost for users. First, we deploy a local cache at each PLC access unit to store popular content requested by users according to a popularity-based data placement. As such, the proposed cache-enabled scheme can not only bring popular data close to users at the edge of PLC networks but also reduce the PLC backhaul burden. Second, in the data delivery stage, we propose a precoding design for each access unit and formulate average downloading price for each user. In particular, we solve optimal precoding vectors to simultaneously meet the target transmission rate and minimize the price of each user through an efficient algorithm. Numerical results corroborate that our cache-enabled MIMO PLC network can guarantee the transmission reliability whilst reducing the downloading price compared with the existing related works.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache-Enabled MIMO Power Line Communications With Precoding Design in Smart Grid","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2019.2947773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/9040688/08871116.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2019.2947773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9040688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"Cache-Enabled MIMO Power Line Communications With Precoding Design in Smart Grid","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8871116/","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2020","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19469989","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFB1004800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61727802, 61771244 and 61872184"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012934","fundingName":"Tomsk Polytechnic University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache-Enabled MIMO Power Line Communications With Precoding Design in Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tgcn-li-2947773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106563S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"9040688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9040688","articleId":"8871116","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8871124,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Erfan Eshratifar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/9319616/8871124/eshra-2947893-small.gif","p":["Amir Erfan Eshratifar received the dual BS degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2017.

End-side services, such as intelligent personal assistants, autonomous cars, and smart home services often employ either simple local models on the mobile or complex remote models on the cloud. However, recent studies have shown that partitioning the DNN computations between the mobile and cloud can increase the latency and energy efficiencies. In this paper, we propose an efficient, adaptive, and practical engine, JointDNN, for collaborative computation between a mobile device and cloud for DNNs in both inference and training phase. JointDNN not only provides an energy and performance efficient method of querying DNNs for the mobile side but also benefits the cloud server by reducing the amount of its workload and communications compared to the cloud-only approach. Given the DNN architecture, we investigate the efficiency of processing some layers on the mobile device and some layers on the cloud server. We provide optimization formulations at layer granularity for forward- and backward-propagations in DNNs, which can adapt to mobile battery limitations and cloud server load constraints and quality of service. JointDNN achieves up to 18 and 32 times reductions on the latency and mobile energy consumption of querying DNNs compared to the status-quo approaches, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2019.2947893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9319616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2019.2947893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/9319616/08871124.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"JointDNN: An Efficient Training and Inference Engine for Intelligent Mobile Cloud Computing Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"JointDNN: An Efficient Training and Inference Engine for Intelligent Mobile Cloud Computing Services","volume":"20","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8871124/","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2021","accessionNumber":"20287068","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871124/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF SHF"},{"fundingName":"DARPA MTO"},{"fundingName":"USC Annenberg Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"JointDNN: An Efficient Training and Inference Engine for Intelligent Mobile Cloud Computing Services","sourcePdf":"tmc-eshratifar-2947893-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17938S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"9319616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"9319616","articleId":"8871124","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871126,"authors":[{"name":"Tsan-Ming Wu","affiliation":["Chung Yuan Christian University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/9040688/8871126/wu-2947684-small.gif","p":["Tsan-Ming Wu (M\u201902) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 1986, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2000.

In comparison to the conventional amplification factor, the PEAF is designed by minimizing the total transmission power whereas maintaining the required quality of service. Moreover, in accordance with the PEAF scheme, exact closed-form expressions of the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of the received signal-to-noise ratio are derived with one-way and two-way relaying over Nakagami-m frequency-selective fading channels. Monte Carlo simulation is executed to verify these mathematical expressions. Simulation results show that the relay system with the proposed PEAF possesses a lower outage probability and higher energy efficiency in comparison with counterparts of the conventional variable-gain AF relaying.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9040688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2019.2947684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/9040688/08871126.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"164","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2019.2947684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green Relaying With Power-Efficient Amplification Factors Over Nakagami-- Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"Green Relaying With Power-Efficient Amplification Factors Over Nakagami-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8871126/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19469980","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC 100-2221-E-033-036-MY3 and MOST 104-2221-E-033-016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Relaying With Power-Efficient Amplification Factors Over Nakagami-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tgcn-wu-2947684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101976S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"9040688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9040688","articleId":"8871126","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8871127,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Application of machine learning for gaining new insights from seismic data is a rapidly evolving sub-field of seismology. The availability of a large amount of seismic data and computational resources, together with the development of advanced techniques can foster more robust models and algorithms to process and analyze seismic signals. Known examples or labeled data sets, are the essential requisite for building supervised models. Seismology has labeled data, but the reliability of those labels is highly variable, and the lack of high-quality labeled data sets to serve as ground truth as well as the lack of standard benchmarks are obstacles to more rapid progress. In this paper we present a high-quality, large-scale, and global data set of local earthquake and non-earthquake signals recorded by seismic instruments. The data set in its current state contains two categories: (1) local earthquake waveforms (recorded at \u201clocal\u201d distances within 350 km of earthquakes) and (2) seismic noise waveforms that are free of earthquake signals. Together these data comprise ~1.2 million time series or more than 19,000 hours of seismic signal recordings. Constructing such a large-scale database with reliable labels is a challenging task. Here, we present the properties of the data set, describe the data collection, quality control procedures, and processing steps we undertook to insure accurate labeling, and discuss potential applications. We hope that the scale and accuracy of STEAD presents new and unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the seismological community and beyond.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08871127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"179464","endPage":"179476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD): A Global Data Set of Seismic Signals for AI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD): A Global Data Set of Seismic Signals for AI","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19251437","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8871127/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Stanford Center for Induced and Triggered Seismicity (SCITS)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"FA9453-19-C-0073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD): A Global Data Set of Seismic Signals for AI","sourcePdf":"access-mousavi-2947848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148819S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8871127","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8871128,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o P.

Yet, the evolution towards learning-based data driven networks is still in its infancy, and much of the realization of the promised benefits requires thorough research and development. Fundamental questions remain as to where and how ML can really complement the well-established, well-tested communication systems designed over the last four decades. Moreover, adaptation of machine learning methods is likely needed to realize their full potential in the wireless context. This is particularly challenging for the lower layers of the protocol stack, where the constraints, problem formulation, and even the objectives may fundamentally differ from the typical scenarios to which machine learning has been successfully applied in recent years. In addition, a thorough understanding of the fundamental performance limits is also essential in order to establish quality-of-service guarantees that are common in communication system design. Such challenges, which lie at the core of the special issue, can be categorized into a number of research topics ranging from the optization of neural networks architectures that are suited to wireless communication links (inclusing autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement based networks etc) to performance analysis, to the acceleration of data-driven training, and possibly in distributed settings. The application domains within the wireless realm are also quite diverse in nature with promising preliminary results in the area of physical layer design and resource allocation as well as for network service orchestrations. Testbeds and experimental evaluations are also begining to be reported.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2019.2934252","startPage":"2409","endPage":"2412","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8871138/08871142.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2934252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guest Editorial Special Issue on Machine Learning in Wireless Communication\u2014Part 2","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Special issues and sections","Machine learning","Wireless communication","Wireless networks"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/8871138/8871142-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Guest Editorial Special Issue on Machine Learning in Wireless Communication\u2014Part 2","volume":"37","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8871142/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ERC under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program","grantNumber":"670896 PERFUME"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program Starting Grant BEACON","grantNumber":"677854"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008628","fundingName":"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CIF-1525194, ECCS-1608961 and ECCS-1807660"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Guest Editorial Special Issue on Machine Learning in Wireless Communication\u2014Part 2","sourcePdf":"jsac-editorial-2934252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037972S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8871138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8871138","articleId":"8871142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8871152,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang Duy Trinh","affiliation":["Centre Tecnologic Telecomunicacions Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8871152/trinh-2947742-small.gif","p":["Hoang Duy Trinh received the B.Sc. degree in information engineering and the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Padova, Italy, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for detecting network anomalies using mobile traffic data: collecting data from the LTE Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) of different eNodeBs, we implement deep learning algorithms in a semi-supervised way to detect potential traffic anomalies that are generated, for example, by unexpected crowd gathering. With respect to other types of mobile dataset, using LTE PDCCH information, we are able to obtain fine-grained and high-resolution data for the users that are connected to the LTE eNodeB. Through a semi-supervised approach, algorithms are trained to detect anomalies using only one class of traffic samples. We design two algorithms based on stacked-LSTM Neural Networks: 1) LSTM Autoencoder (LSTM-AE), in which the objective is to reconstruct the traffic samples 2) LSTM traffic predictor (LSTM-PRED), where the goal is to predict the traffic in the next time-instants, based on historical data. In both cases, we analyze the reconstruction (or prediction) error to assess if the mobile traffic presents anomalies or not. Using the F1-score as metric, we demonstrate that the proposed methods are able to identify the anomalous traffic periods, beating a benchmark that comprises different state-of-the-art algorithms for anomaly detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

Although IEEE 1584-2002 has provided the calculation guide based on tests with the arcing electrodes in a vertical plane, applications where the traditional vertical arrangement is not directly applicable have been drawing more attention over the past few years. Due to the varied thermal behaviors of arc under different equipment configuration and the varied bus connection mode, for the purpose to achieve the adequate protection on arc flash thermal injury, it is necessary to analyze the effect of different electrode geometries on arc flash protection boundary (AFPB). According to the prior work on the development of IEEE 1584-2018, this article fully discusses the impact of electrode geometry on incident energy exposure level and AFPB. With the multiple electrode geometry designed tests, thermal behaviors of arc under different electrode orientation, gap distance, and equipment configurations have been analyzed. According to test results, correction equations were derived under each typical electrode geometry to adjust the AFPB calculation model of IEEE 1584-2002. Through the comparisons, the corrected model can better reflect the actual effects of electrode geometry, meanwhile showing a good ability to provide reasonable AFPB for practical uses.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2019.2947858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8963772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2019.2947858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/8963772/08871167.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Electrode Geometry on Arc Flash Protection Boundary","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Electrode Geometry on Arc Flash Protection Boundary","volume":"56","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8871167/","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2020","accessionNumber":"19280966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871167/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607025"},{"fundingName":"IEEE/NFPA Research Collaboration on Arc Flash Phenomena"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Electrode Geometry on Arc Flash Protection Boundary","sourcePdf":"tia-zhang-2947858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069397S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"8963772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8963772","articleId":"8871167","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871169,"authors":[{"name":"Kyuhwa Han","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/8959511/8871169/han-2947897-small.gif","p":["Kyuhwa Han received the BS degree in computer engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Korea, in 2013.

However, two major concerns arise in designing SSDs. First, the size of the address mapping table is increasing in proportion to the capacity of the SSD. The SSD-internal firmware, called flash translation layer (FTL), must maintain the address mapping table in the internal DRAM. Although the previously proposed demand map loading technique uses a small size of cached map table, the technique aggravates poor random performance. Second, there are many redundant writes in storage workloads, which have an adverse effect on the performance and lifetime of the SSD. For example, many transaction-supporting applications use the write-ahead-log (WAL) scheme, which writes the same data twice. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel transaction-supporting SSD, called WAL-SSD, which logs transaction data at the internally-managed WAL area and relocates the data atomically via the FTL-level remap operation at the transaction checkpointing. It can also be used to transform random write requests to sequential requests. We implemented a prototype of WAL-SSD with a real SSD device. Experiments demonstrate the performance improvement by WAL-SSD with three use cases: remap-journaling, atomic multi-block update, and random write logging.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2019.2947897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2019.2947897","startPage":"260","endPage":"273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/8959511/08871169.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WAL-SSD: Address Remapping-Based Write-Ahead-Logging Solid-State Disks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"WAL-SSD: Address Remapping-Based Write-Ahead-Logging Solid-State Disks","volume":"69","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19267158","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8871169/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion","grantNumber":"IITP-2017-0-00914"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WAL-SSD: Address Remapping-Based Write-Ahead-Logging Solid-State Disks","sourcePdf":"tc-han-2947897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124471S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8959511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8959511","articleId":"8871169","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871174,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yuan","affiliation":["University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8871174/yuan-2947714-small.gif","p":["Jing Yuan received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation from the Hebei Normal University of Technology and Science, Hebei, in 2016.

First, the discrete wavelet transform is used to present the multiscale representation of the raw data. Second, a multiscale convolutional neural network is used to extract the features at each scale, and then the extracted multiscale features are fused by the long short-term memory network to further reduce useless information and retain useful information. Finally, softmax classification is performed. The proposed method has two advantages: 1) the hierarchical learning structure with multiple pairs of convolutional and pooling layers can effectively learn nonlinear, high-dimensional fault features; and 2) the multiscale feature learning scheme can capture complementary diagnosis information at different scales. Detailed comparative studies between the proposed method and conventional methods have been carried out through the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process and the p-xylene oxidation reaction process.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08871174.pdf","startPage":"151189","endPage":"151202","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiscale Feature Learning Scheme Based on Deep Learning for Industrial Process Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"A Multiscale Feature Learning Scheme Based on Deep Learning for Industrial Process Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8871174/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087203","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"17YF1428300"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61903251"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Multiscale Feature Learning Scheme Based on Deep Learning for Industrial Process Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"access-tian-2947714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106503S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8871174","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":8871177,"authors":[{"name":"Rosendo Pe\u00f1a-Eguiluz","affiliation":["Plasma Physics Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares, Ocoyoacac, M\u00e9xico"],"bio":{"p":["Rosendo\u00a0Pe\u00f1a-Eguiluz (S\u201999\u2013M\u201903) was born in 1968.

In this amplifier the available output electric power is determined by the addition of the electric power generated by each of the associated devices. Herein, two MOSFETs connected in series are linked, on the one hand, to a dc voltage source and, on the other hand, to a resonant LC circuit and a resistance charge connected in parallel to the capacitor. Both MOSFETs are driven by a gate-to-source square signal allowing a synchronized commutation, promoting a quasi-resonant amplifier behavior similar to that of the classical class-E amplifier; with the characteristic of being able to manage the double of applied dc voltage amplitude and to supply twice electric power to the same load in comparison with the class-E amplifier. This device is able to distribute the same electric power between both MOSFETs, reducing at almost half the magnitude of applied drain-to-source voltage. As a result, voltage stress of each power switch is reduced in comparison with the typical class-E amplifier. Drain efficiency (DE), power added efficiency, and gain of the proposed device were obtained in function of the applied dc voltage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry

calculate Q-factor, and diagnose device imperfection-induced impairments is proposed. TL can be used to extract system information and optical signal characteristics contained in eye diagrams and apply the learned knowledge and extracted features obtained from source tasks to related target tasks. As a source task, the proposed method estimates the transmission distance of a fiber link using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based eye diagram recognition. The feature extraction layers of the CNN are transferred to six target tasks involving the recognition of cross percentage, levels \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1,\u201d eye height and width, and Q-factor. Using TL reduces the total training times for on-off keying (OOK) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) formats by > 95% and 60%, respectively. We also investigated six common PAM4 impairments caused by transmitter imperfection by setting the impairment category identification as source task and the impairment-degree diagnoses as target tasks. The TL methods consistently outperformed non-TL methods, with higher accuracies and significantly reduced training times. The proposed impairment diagnosis technique should be useful in impairment healing and fault correction.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2947705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2947705","startPage":"1","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8877962/08871178.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Eye Diagram Analysis: A Transfer Learning Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Eye Diagram Analysis: A Transfer Learning Approach","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"impactStatement":"This paper presents a deep transfer learning (TL)-based method for multifunctional eye diagram analysis and comprehensive impairment diagnosis.

This paper proposes a novel multi-objective optimization formulation for STATCOM allocation problem to mitigate voltage sags. The allocation of STATCOM is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) with two conflicting objectives including the voltage sag performance and annual investment costs of STATCOM. To analytically evaluate the voltage sag performance in the optimization process, a mathematical voltage sag profile calculation model of power system with multiple STATCOMs is proposed and solved by nonlinear programming method. System Average RMS Variation Frequency index-X index is chosen to quantify the voltage sag performance for optimization. Sensitivity-based candidate bus selection is also performed as an essential step to reduce problem size. An improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called SPEA2+SDE (Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm with shifting density estimation) is utilized to solve the proposed MOP model, so a set of Pareto optimal STATCOM allocations for voltage sag mitigation can be derived demonstrating the trade-off between two objectives and better supporting the decision-making. IEEE 30-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system are tested to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2947715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9099109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/9099109/08871179.pdf","endPage":"1422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimal STATCOM Allocation for Voltage Sag Mitigation","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2947715","startPage":"1410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimal STATCOM Allocation for Voltage Sag Mitigation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871179/","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2020","accessionNumber":"19632807","publicationDate":"June 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8871179/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51807126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimal STATCOM Allocation for Voltage Sag Mitigation","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-wang-2947715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146881S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"9099109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9099109","articleId":"8871179","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8871181,"authors":[{"name":"Zehui Xiong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/9061109/8871181/xiong-2947914-small.gif","p":["Zehui Xiong (S'17) received the BEng degree with the highest honors in telecommunication engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2016.

Thus, renting mining service from cloud providers becomes a reasonable solution, which is called cloud mining. This enables users who want to mine, i.e., miners, to purchase and lease an amount of hashing power from the cloud/edge providers without any hassle of managing the infrastructure. In this paper, we study the interactions among the cloud/edge providers and miners in blockchain using a multi-leader multi-follower game-theoretic approach, in order to support proof-of-work based blockchains application. Due to the inherent complexity of the formulated game, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to investigate the optimum solution. Utilizing the decomposition characteristics and fast convergence of ADMM, we obtain the optimum results in a distributed manner. Simulation results demonstrate that with the proposed solutions, the optimization of the utilities of miners and the profits of providers can be jointly achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2019.2947914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9061109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2019.2947914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/9061109/08871181.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud/Edge Computing Service Management in Blockchain Networks: Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Game-Based ADMM for Pricing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Cloud/Edge Computing Service Management in Blockchain Networks: Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Game-Based ADMM for Pricing","volume":"13","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8871181/","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","accessionNumber":"19551825","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871181/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure NSoE","grantNumber":"DeST-SCI2019-0007"},{"fundingName":"A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant Call on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing","grantNumber":"RGANS1906 and WASP/NTU M4082187 (4080)"},{"fundingName":"Singapore MOE Tier 1","grantNumber":"2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17"},{"fundingName":"MOE Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15"},{"fundingName":"Singapore","grantNumber":"NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277"},{"fundingName":"Singapore EMA Energy Resilience","grantNumber":"NRF2017EWT-EP003-041"},{"fundingName":"Canada NSERC Discovery","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2019-06375"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0939370 and CCF-1513915"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud/Edge Computing Service Management in Blockchain Networks: Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Game-Based ADMM for Pricing","sourcePdf":"tsc-kang-2947914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201089S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9061109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"9061109","articleId":"8871181","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871185,"authors":[{"name":"Meijun Qu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"bio":{"p":["Meijun Qu (qumeijun@bupt.edu.cn) is with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China.

Equivalent circuits of the multimode resonator are analyzed by adopting the odd- and even-mode analysis approach. To prove the effectiveness of the equivalent circuit, scattering (S)-parameters of the equivalent circuit are simulated in Advanced Design System (ADS). Additionally, transmission coefficients are studied under the weakly coupling condition. The first and second resonant points are introduced by even and odd modes, respectively, whereas the third resonance is caused by the embedded stepped impedance resonator (ESIR). The CPW-fed antenna element is designed based on the proposed resonator. CPW fed not only excites the multimode resonator but also generates an extra resonance between the odd mode and ESIR resonant frequencies. Furthermore, the odd-mode resonance creates the lower cutoff frequency, and the resonance caused by ESIR forms the higher cutoff frequency. Hence, a filteringlike operating frequency band is achieved without introducing an extra filtering circuit. The filtering characteristic is favorable for the system to realize high sensitivity and reduce outof-band interferences simultaneously.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Wideband Single-Layer Slot MIMO Antenna and Its Decoupling Method: Using the Odd- and Even-Mode Analysis Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2019.2943296","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/74/9161146/08871185.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2019.2943296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Wideband Single-Layer Slot MIMO Antenna and Its Decoupling Method: Using the Odd- and Even-Mode Analysis Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8871185/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2020","publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","accessionNumber":"20050349","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61427801; 61427801; 61601040"},{"fundingId":"http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation","grantNumber":"CX2017208"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Wideband Single-Layer Slot MIMO Antenna and Its Decoupling Method: Using the Odd- and Even-Mode Analysis Approach","sourcePdf":"map-qu-2943296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07784S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"9161146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9161146","articleId":"8871185","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8871194,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Mirza","affiliation":["COMSATS University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Mirza","id":"38522384100"},{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K."],"firstName":"Gan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37291760700"},{"name":"Saqib Saleem","affiliation":["COMSATS University Islamabad - Sahiwal Campus, Sahiwal, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Saqib","lastName":"Saleem","id":"37086008276"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8871194","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","MIMO communication","Precoding","Data communication","Coherence","Optimization","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","optimisation","precoding","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-duplex MU MIMO transmission","CSI quality","UL CSI","multiple-input multiple-output systems","full-duplex multiuser MIMO systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO communication","precoding"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the optimization of uplink (UL) channel state information (CSI) training in the full-duplex (FD) based multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Here, an FD-assisted BS performs simultaneous UL CSI training and downlink data transmission that produces self interference (SI). Following the UL training stage, the BS uses the conventional half-duplex (HD) MU MIMO transmission with zero-forcing precoding. To find an optimal UL CSI training length that achieves a balance between the training overhead and CSI quality, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the sum spectral efficiency of the network. To ease the analysis, we derive a lower bound on the user rate in the FD phase, which is then used together with the HD user rate to obtain the sub-optimal solution. We also provide a closed-form expression to approximate the UL training length. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed UL training outperforms the fixed length training and it closely matches the performance with an exhaustive search.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2947677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8930336/08871194.pdf","startPage":"2325","endPage":"2329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2947677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Uplink CSI Training for Full-Duplex Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Uplink CSI Training for Full-Duplex Multiuser MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871194/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19305796","htmlLink":"/document/8871194/","volume":"23","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N007840/1 and EP/N008219/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Uplink CSI Training for Full-Duplex Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-mirza-2947677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083097S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8930336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8930336","articleId":"8871194","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871200,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yin","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"bio":{"p":["Bo Yin (yinbo@cqupt.edu.cn) is an associate professor at the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China.

The proposed antenna element incorporates two perpendicular magnetic coupling feeding (MCF) networks and an H-shaped slot in the ground plane to improve the port isolation. Simulation results indicate that it has an isolation of more than 38 dB. To suppress the mutual coupling between antenna elements, a dual wall consisting of a novel metasurface structure is introduced. When spatial-wave incidents occur, the isolation wall can restrain the electromagnetic wave propagation. The electromagnetic waves produce resonance on the wall surface, which scatters some of the resonance, while the rest is transmitted to the ground and weakened by the decoupling structure between two elements. The metasurface walls, which are inserted vertically between the antenna elements, improve the isolation by roughly 5.9 dB within the 2.5-2.7-GHz frequency band and reach a maximum of -22.8 dB at approximately 2.6 GHz. The proposed antenna has been fabricated, and the experimental results are near the simulation responses.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/74/8982103/08871200.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2019.2943299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2019.2943299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8982103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Metasurface Wall for Isolation Enhancement: Minimizing mutual coupling between MIMO antenna elements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Couplings","Microstrip antennas","Antenna feeds","Bandwidth","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","metamaterial antennas","MIMO communication","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolation wall","metasurface wall","isolation enhancement","minimizing mutual coupling","MIMO antenna elements","dual-polarized isolation","high-isolation","multiple-input multiple-output antenna array","microbase-station application","perpendicular magnetic coupling feeding networks","port isolation","dual wall","metasurface structure","spatial-wave incidents","MIMO antenna array","MCF networks","H-shaped slot","frequency 2.5 GHz to 2.7 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Metasurface Wall for Isolation Enhancement: Minimizing mutual coupling between MIMO antenna elements","volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8871200/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","accessionNumber":"19320410","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601074; 61401054"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing Education Commission Science and Technology Research Project","grantNumber":"KJ1600438"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing Basic Science and Frontier Technology Research Project","grantNumber":"cstc2017jcyjAX0193"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Metasurface Wall for Isolation Enhancement: Minimizing mutual coupling between MIMO antenna elements","sourcePdf":"map-yin-2943299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149777S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"8982103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8982103","articleId":"8871200","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":8871201,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Ren","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Ren","orcid":"0000-0001-9096-8792","id":"37086553971"},{"name":"Yan Xu","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-0503-183X","id":"37403527500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"8871201","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1398},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Adaptation models","Testing","Matrix decomposition","Load modeling","Power system dynamics","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","learning (artificial intelligence)","power engineering computing","power system faults","power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer learning-based power system online dynamic security assessment","unlearned faults","data-driven method","pre-fault dynamic security assessment","power systems","potential faults","trained model","hybrid learning","DSA model","fault database","transfer learning technique","trained data","unknown data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven","dynamic security assessment","hybrid ensemble model","transfer learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871201","abstract":"This letter proposes a novel data-driven method for pre-fault dynamic security assessment (DSA) of power systems.

While current research on this topic is still growing, various security concerns have been raised and the security of blockchains has been becoming the most important issue which must be well addressed. Blockchain transactions are based on digital signatures, where the public key is associated with the ownership of the digital coin. User management of public or permissionless blockchain is ad hoc, i.e., any user can join and leave the blockchain network and participate in the Proof of Work (PoW). However, in a private blockchain and a permissioned blockchain, there are usually some constraints for users. In this paper, we investigate a scenario which provides a blockchain network with a set of policies where every user's signing key is associated with a policy set. It is particularly interesting while users are working in different sectors. We call our scheme as \u201cpolicy-driven\u201d, since policies in our scheme restrict users' rights. Our system is featured with a novel and lightweight policy-driven signature (PDS) scheme whose security has been proven formally. To justify our scenario, we provide experimental results and an example for the railway management services.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blockchain","Bitcoin","Public key","Digital signatures","Smart contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptocurrencies","data privacy","digital signatures","public key cryptography","railways","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["policy-driven signature","user signing key","proof of work","public blockchain","user management","blockchain transactions","advanced digital services","transport systems","policy-driven blockchain","railway management services","permissioned blockchain","private blockchain","blockchain network","permissionless blockchain","digital coin","public key","digital signatures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","access control","digital signature","service computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871202","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2019.2947892","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/9061109/08871202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2019.2947892","startPage":"230","endPage":"240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9061109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Policy-Driven Blockchain and Its Applications for Transport Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Policy-Driven Blockchain and Its Applications for Transport Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871202/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8871202/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2020","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","accessionNumber":"19551826","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872087"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Policy-Driven Blockchain and Its Applications for Transport Systems","sourcePdf":"tsc-mu-2947892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176013S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9061109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9061109","articleId":"8871202","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871212,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Yi Li","affiliation":["National Taipei University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8871212/li-2947623-small.gif","p":["Chung-Yi Li received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), Taiwan, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

In a triple-wavelength polarization multiplexing scenario with vestigial sideband (VSB) four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4)/CATV/16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation, the channel capacity is considerably multiplied and the overall performance is significantly improved. With a tunable optical band-pass filter, polarization-tracking free de-multiplexing is attained by removing other wavelengths with different polarizations, and the optical VSB PAM4/CATV/16-QAM-OFDM signal is created by partially reducing the optical signal's linewidth. Compared with established polarization multiplexing fiber-FSO integrations with complex polarization de-multiplexing mechanism, it demonstrates a notable one with the benefits of simplicity and flexibility. Sufficiently low bit error rate, acceptable PAM4 eye diagrams, clear constellation map, and high composite second-order/composite triple beat values are attained through a 40 km single-mode fiber transport with 200 m free-space link. This demonstrated triple-wavelength polarization multiplexing fiber-FSO integrated system is promising because it not only incorporates fiber backhaul with optical wireless feeder, but it also simplifies system's structure and enhance system's overall performance.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08871212.pdf","startPage":"151023","endPage":"151033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Internet/CATV/5G Fiber-FSO Integrated System With a Triple-Wavelength Polarization Multiplexing Scenario","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Internet/CATV/5G Fiber-FSO Integrated System With a Triple-Wavelength Polarization Multiplexing Scenario","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087331","htmlLink":"/document/8871212/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qualcomm-NTUT Research Project","grantNumber":"NAT-414684"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Hybrid Internet/CATV/5G Fiber-FSO Integrated System With a Triple-Wavelength Polarization Multiplexing Scenario","sourcePdf":"access-lu-2947623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112835S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8871212","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8871213,"authors":[{"name":"Yiping Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, School of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9112796/8871213/ygao-2947800-small.gif","p":["Yiping Gao was born in Qingdao, China, 1991.

Deep learning (DL) becomes a research hotspot in vision-based defect recognition due to outstanding performances. However, most of the DL methods require a large sample to learn the defect information. While in some real-world cases, it is difficult and costly for data collecting, and only a small sample is available. Generally, a small sample contains less information, which may mislead the DL models so that they cannot work as expected. Therefore, this requirement impedes the wide applications of DL in vision-based defect recognition. To overcome this problem, this article proposes a multilevel information fusion-based DL method for vision-based defect recognition. In the proposed method, a three-level Gaussian pyramid is introduced to generate multilevel information of the defect so that more information is available for model training. After the Gaussian pyramid, three VGG16 networks are built to learn the information and the outputs are fused for the final recognition result. The experimental results show that the proposed method can extract more useful information and achieve better performances on small-sample tasks, compared with the conventional DL methods and defect recognition methods. Furthermore, the analysis results of the robustness and response time also indicate that the proposed method is robust for the noise input, and it is fast for defect recognition, which takes 13.74 ms to handle a defect image.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2019.2947800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9112796/08871213.pdf","startPage":"3980","endPage":"3991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2019.2947800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9112796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multilevel Information Fusion-Based Deep Learning Method for Vision-Based Defect Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871213/","displayDocTitle":"A Multilevel Information Fusion-Based Deep Learning Method for Vision-Based Defect Recognition","volume":"69","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2020","accessionNumber":"19672835","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8871213/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"51825502, 51775216 and 51711530038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2018CFA078"},{"fundingName":"Program for HUST Academic Frontier Youth Team","grantNumber":"2017QYTD04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multilevel Information Fusion-Based Deep Learning Method for Vision-Based Defect Recognition","sourcePdf":"tim-li-2947800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1224S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9112796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9112796","articleId":"8871213","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8871216,"authors":[{"name":"Javier D.

These iterative algorithms present a good trade-off in terms of performance, area and power. We present a floating-point division and square root unit, which implements a radix-64 floating-point division and a radix-16 floating-point square root. To have an affordable implementation, each radix-64 division iteration and radix-16 square root iteration are made of simpler radix-4 iterations: 3 radix-4 iterations in division and 2 in square root. Speculation is used between consecutive radix-4 iterations to get a reduced timing. There are three different parts in digit-recurrence implementations: initialization, digit iterations, and rounding. The digit iteration is the iterative part and it uses the same logic for several cycles. Division and square root share partially the initialization and rounding stages, whereas each one has different logicforthe digit iterations. The result is a low-latency floating-point divider and square root, requiring 11, 6, and 4 cycles for double, single and half-precision division with normalized operands and result, and 15, 8 and 5 cycles for square root. One ortwo additional cycles are needed in case of subnormal operand(s) or result.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and

transmission with wider signal bandwidths and higher-order multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is inevitable. This work demonstrates a possible function split option for the next generation fronthaul interface (NGFI). The proof-of-concept downlink architecture consists of real-time sigma-delta modulated signal over fiber (SDoF) links in combination with distributed multi-user (MU) MIMO transmission. The setup is fully implemented using off-the-shelf and in-house developed components. A single SDoF link achieves an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 3.14% for a 163.84 MHz-bandwidth 256-QAM OFDM signal (958.64 Mbps) with a carrier frequency around 3.5 GHz transmitted over 100 m OM4 multi-mode fiber at 850 nm using a commercial QSFP module. The centralized architecture of the proposed setup introduces no frequency asynchronism among remote radio units. For most cases, the 2 \u00d7 2 MU-MIMO transmission has little performance degradation compared to SISO, 0.8 dB EVM degradation for 40.96 MHz-bandwidth signals and 1.4 dB for 163.84 MHz-bandwidth on average, implying that the wireless spectral efficiency almost doubles by exploiting spatial multiplexing. A 1.4 Gbps data rate (720 Mbps per user, 163.84 MHz-bandwidth, 64-QAM) is reached with an average EVM of 6.66%. The performance shows that this approach is feasible for the high-capacity hot-spot scenario.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2019.2947786","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8986818/08871223.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2019.2947786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8986818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Multi-User MIMO Transmission Using Real-Time Sigma-Delta-Over-Fiber for Next Generation Fronthaul Interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871223/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Multi-User MIMO Transmission Using Real-Time Sigma-Delta-Over-Fiber for Next Generation Fronthaul Interface","volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2020","accessionNumber":"19341676","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8871223/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ERC Advanced","grantNumber":"695495"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Multi-User MIMO Transmission Using Real-Time Sigma-Delta-Over-Fiber for Next Generation Fronthaul Interface","sourcePdf":"jlt-wu-2947786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079953S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2020","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8986818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8986818","articleId":"8871223","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8871333,"authors":[{"name":"Hongying Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8972641/8871333/wang-2944467-small.gif","p":["Hongying Wang received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (summa cum laude) in microelectronics from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Heilongjiang, China, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

Recent studies have demonstrated that multi-antenna systems can leverage signal-level exposure models to jointly mitigate user radiation absorption and achieve high data rates. This is especially important for millimeter wave technologies, which are susceptible to power back-off techniques due to high propagation and blockage losses. However, prior models require significant overhead in the form of exposure measurements to compute model parameters and cannot be easily modified to predict electromagnetic absorption in different testing configurations. This article proposes methods to approximate the characteristic matrix of a quadratic model for two exposure measures in the millimeter wave band: incident power density and surface specific absorption rate (SAR). The presented models can be calculated with a small number of parameters and can be altered to account for mutual coupling, near-field effects, and changes in the exposure scenario. Spatial sampling schemes based on these models are derived to determine how many testing points are necessary to estimate exposure in a region within a specified margin of error. Software simulation results with half-wave dipoles validate the accuracy of the proposed models in a millimeter wave scenario.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2019.2946742","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/9086550/08871335.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9086550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2019.2946742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"3963","endPage":"3977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-Level Models of Pointwise Electromagnetic Exposure for Millimeter Wave Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Signal-Level Models of Pointwise Electromagnetic Exposure for Millimeter Wave Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871335/","volume":"68","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8871335/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2020","accessionNumber":"19707811","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1403458 and CNS-1642982"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-Level Models of Pointwise Electromagnetic Exposure for Millimeter Wave Communication","sourcePdf":"tap-castellanos-2946742-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155805S","chronDate":"May  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"9086550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9086550","articleId":"8871335","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8871337,"authors":[{"name":"Laxmeesha Somappa","affiliation":["IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8972641/8871337/somap-2944272-small.gif","p":["Laxmeesha Somappa received the B.E. degree in 2011 and the M.Tech. degree from the IIT Madras, Chennai, in 2015.

The proposed method uses a simple linear model to arrive at the loop filter transfer function and minimize the SNR degradation across RC corners while minimizing the area and power per channel. The method was implemented in Matlab and verified using Spectre simulations. For target ENOB of 9 bits and consumed energy of less than 60 fJ/conv a CTDSM was automatically designed using the proposed method and fabricated in standard 180 nm CMOS mixed mode technology.

A system model taking into account the reverberation (clutter) produced by the radar system onto the massive MIMO receiver is proposed. In this scenario, several receivers for uplink channel estimation and data detection are proposed, ranging from the simple channel-matched beamformer to the zero-forcing and linear minimum mean square error receivers for clutter disturbance rejection, under the two opposite situations of perfectly known and completely unknown clutter covariance. A theoretical analysis is also provided, deriving a lower bound on the achievable uplink spectral efficiency and the mutual information between the input Gaussian-encoded symbols and the observables available at the communication receiver of the cellular massive MIMO system: regarding the latter, in particular, it is shown that, in the large antenna number regime, and under the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI), the effect of radar clutter at the base station is suppressed and single-user capacity may be restored. Numerical results, illustrating the performance of the proposed detection schemes, confirm the findings of the theoretical analysis, and permit quantifying the system robustness to clutter effect for increasing number of antennas at the base station.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2939816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08871348.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2939816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communications and Radar Coexistence in the Massive MIMO Regime: Uplink Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871348/","displayDocTitle":"Communications and Radar Coexistence in the Massive MIMO Regime: Uplink Analysis","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19262632","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8871348/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca (MIUR) Program \u201cDipartimenti di Eccellenza 2018-2022\u201d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communications and Radar Coexistence in the Massive MIMO Regime: Uplink Analysis","sourcePdf":"twc-buzzi-2939816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091124S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8871348","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8871349,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Cezar Pais","affiliation":["NAVAIR/NAWCAD, NAS PAX, Patuxent River, USA","Navy SSP, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/8902243/8871349/pais-2942997-small.gif","p":["Salvatore Cezar Pais received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.","He was as a NASA Graduate Research Fellow with the NASA Glenn (Lewis) Research Center, Cleveland.

This concept has the capability of maximizing the product of plasma pressure and energy confinement time to maximize the energy gain, and thus give rise to fusion ignition conditions. The preferred embodiment of this original concept uses a hollow cross-duct configuration of circular cross section in which the concentrated magnetic energy flux from two pairs of opposing curved-headed counter-spinning conical structures (possibly made from an alloy of tungsten with high capacitance) whose outer surfaces are electrically charged compresses a gaseous mixture of fusion fuel into a plasma, heated to extreme temperatures and pressures. The generated high-intensity electromagnetic (EM) radiation heats the plasma and the produced magnetic fields confine it in between the counter-spinning conical structures, named the dynamic fusors (four of them-smoothly curved apex sections opposing each other in pairs). The dynamic fusors can be assemblies of electrified grids and toroidal magnetic coils, arranged within a conical structure whose outer surface is electrically charged. The cross-duct inner surface surrounding the plasma core region is also electrically charged and vibrated in an accelerated mode to minimize the flux of plasma particles (including neutrals) from impacting the PCFD surfaces and initiating a plasma quench. The fusion fuel (preferably deuterium gas) is introduced into the plasma core through the counterspinning conical structures, namely, injected through orifices in the dynamic fusor heads. There is envisioned another even more compact version of this concept, which uses accelerated vibration in a linear-duct configuration (using two counterspinning dynamic fusors only) and would best be suited for fusion power generation on aircraft, or main battle tanks. The concept uses controlled motion of electrically charged matter through accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin subjected to smooth, yet rapid acceleration transients, to generate extremely high-energy/high-intensity EM radiation (fields of high-energy photons) which not only confines the plasma but also greatly compresses itso as to produce a high power density plasma burn, leading to ignition. The PCFD concept can produce power in the gigawatt to terawatt range (and higher) with input power in the kilowatt to megawatt range and can possibly lead to ignition (selfsustained) plasma burn. Several important practical engineering and operational issues with operating a device such as the PCFD are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","volume":"47","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"19188923","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8871349/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Plasma Compression Fusion Device\u2014Enabling Nuclear Fusion Ignition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Naval Innovative Science and Engineering (NISE)\u2014Basic and Applied Research (BAR) Section 219 Program, The High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator (HEEMFG)","grantNumber":"219BAR-17-009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Plasma Compression Fusion Device\u2014Enabling Nuclear Fusion Ignition","sourcePdf":"tps-pais-2942997-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07395S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"8902243","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","xplore-issue":"8902243","articleId":"8871349","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871353,"authors":[{"name":"Mingxue Cai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9488261/8871353/cai-2944637-small.gif","p":["Mingxue Cai (S\u201919) received the B.E. degree in mechanical and electronic engineering from the School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan, China, in 2014, and the M.E. degree in mechanical and electronic engineering from the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2017.

An algorithm framework composed of adaptive tracking differentiator (ATD), extended state observer (ESO), improved nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (I-NTSMC), fuzzy-logic controller (FLC), and estimator of manipulator disturbances, is proposed. The ATD is designed to generate desired motion state and alleviate noise. The ESO is developed to estimate the motion state, systematic uncertainties, and external disturbances. The proposed I-NTSMC method assures the finite-time convergence of the system states and alleviate chattering. The estimation of the manipulator disturbances is incorporated into the control strategy to enhance the station keeping of the vehicle. Finally, underwater autonomous free floating manipulation experiments about opening a door and grasping objects are conducted to validate the theoretical results and confirm the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871353/","volume":"51","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8871353/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Control of Underwater Biomimetic Vehicle\u2013Manipulator System for Free Floating Autonomous Manipulation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB1300101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1713222"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Control of Underwater Biomimetic Vehicle\u2013Manipulator System for Free Floating Autonomous Manipulation","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2944637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102381S","chronDate":"Aug.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9488261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9488261","articleId":"8871353","onlineDate":"16 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8871365,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming He","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"He","id":"37086143487"},{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086858004"},{"name":"Wenyao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, USA"],"firstName":"Wenyao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37597167400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"8871365","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":766},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871365","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reinforcement learning","Internet of Things","Big Data","Biological system modeling","Knowledge transfer","Task analysis","Bio-inspired computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","convolutional neural nets","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","quality of experience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge caching","edge-enabled IoT","QoE model","caching capacity","maximum QoE","adaptive learning rate methods","Deep RL","QoE-driven content-centric caching","deep reinforcement learning","deep neural network approximator","edge-enabled Internet of Things","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"Edge-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) services for users are subject to intelligent management of content-centric caching. Although managing edge caching can reduce storage cost and transmission latency, maintaining a high Quality of Experience (QoE) of caching is still a crucial challenge. In this environment, we study QoE-based content-centric caching. To evaluate the qualities of edge-enabled IoT, we introduce a QoE model which can grasp the influencing factors: (1) storage cost, based on available bandwidth, and (2) transmission latency, depending on the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and caching capacity. As the requirements and signals are stochastic, we use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) architecture to jointly determine the Q-value. Estimating the Q-value, constrained by a maximum QoE, can be conducted in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approximator, as the states and action spaces are on a large scale. Unfortunately, training DNN models can lead to RL instability. To address this issue, fixed target network, experience replay, and adaptive learning rate methods are proposed to balance the Q-value accuracy and accelerate stability in Deep RL (DRL). Experimental results indicate that our approach can gain a higher value of QoE, compared to existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2019.2937608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2019.2937608","startPage":"12","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/10207/8870219/08871365.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8870219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE-Driven Content-Centric Caching With Deep Reinforcement Learning in Edge-Enabled IoT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"QoE-Driven Content-Centric Caching With Deep Reinforcement Learning in Edge-Enabled IoT","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19061805","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8871365/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872195; 61572262"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1718375"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoE-Driven Content-Centric Caching With Deep Reinforcement Learning in Edge-Enabled IoT","sourcePdf":"14mci04-he-2937608-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085803S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"8870219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8870219","articleId":"8871365","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871437,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Another approach is spectral phase filtering, also known as temporal Talbot effect without altering the input spectrum. Typical methods include using linearly chirped fibre Bragg grating, or pulse shaper. Ring-resonator based filters [2] have been proposed to provide temporal Talbot condition, but need stringent control of both coupling coefficient and round-trip phase.

Femtosecond Laser Direct Writing (FLDW) is a well-known rapid prototyping method to fabricate integrated optical circuits in glass chips [1]. These circuits have been used to show various quantum information applications, using the states of photons as qubits [2]. Generally, when transmitting information via single photons, it is desirable to make use of all possible degrees of freedom that this photon has to offer, in order to increase the amount of information transferred per photon. One of these degrees of freedom is the photon's polarization. To make use of this degree of freedom, devices capable of manipulating the polarization are required. Various approaches for manipulating the polarization of photons in a FLDW circuit have been demonstrated before [3-6], of which some were used for quantum information applications [7-11]. In our work, we present a novel method of polarization control using embedded nanogratings as waveplates. These nanogratings are highly birefringent self-assembled structures. Due to their relatively high form birefringence on the order of \u0394\u03b7 = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n, they can be used as a compact waveplate enabling further miniaturization of integrated optical circuits. The properties of these gratings can be altered by using different laser parameters during the inscription process. We have added various waveplates made of nanogratings into FLDW waveguides. We demonstrate their functionality as waveplates of different retardation and optical axis orientations using crossed polarizer birefringence measurements. Due to the chosen writing geometry, a full control over the direction of the optical axis can be achieved. The thickness of these structures is on the order of a few hundred micrometers. Former approaches for polarization control in FLDW circuits required structures in the range of millimetres to centimeters [9-11]. Some of these approaches were limited in the achievable optical axis orientations [9, 10]. Our waveplates can be both used for classical applications and as single qubit quantum gates, which will be demonstrated. Waveplate structures usable as Hadamard, Pauli-x, Pauli-z and Pi/8\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n gates have been fabricated. The transferability to fibers will be discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Femtosecond Laser Direct Written Integrated Retarders Based on Embedded Nanogratings","publicationTitle":"2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871593","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8850908/8871430/08871593.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871430","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Compact Femtosecond Laser Direct Written Integrated Retarders Based on Embedded Nanogratings","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8871593/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"19127686","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Femtosecond Laser Direct Written Integrated Retarders Based on Embedded Nanogratings","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"cm54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060807S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8850908","isNumber":"8871430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8850908","xplore-issue":"8871430","articleId":"8871593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8871596,"authors":[{"name":"T.

While clock frequency determines the operation speed and has direct influence on the performance of the accelerators, we propose to apply overclocking, a circuit optimization approach that enables higher clock frequency, on general CNN accelerators. This technique brings significant performance improvement, but it leads to moderate timing errors, wrong computing results and low prediction accuracy. By taking advantage of the inherent fault tolerance of neural networks, we opt to learn the computing errors together with the application data with additional on-accelerator training. In this case, the resulting models can be resilient to the errors and do not necessarily suffer considerable prediction accuracy loss. In addition, we also take the worst case of overclocking into consideration with a series of approaches ranging from fault detection to fault recovery in case of hardware crash. Finally, we demonstrate the use of overclocking on a CNN accelerator implemented on Xilinx KCU1500 with comprehensive experiments. The experiments show that overclocking in combination with the on-accelerator neural network training improves both the neural network performance and energy efficiency with small prediction accuracy loss.","doi":"10.1109/ITC-Asia.2019.00039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITC-Asia.2019.00039","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Test Conference in Asia (ITC-Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Test Conference in Asia (ITC-Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863849/8871487/08871619.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Squeezing the Last MHz for CNN Acceleration on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Squeezing the Last MHz for CNN Acceleration on FPGAs","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sep 2019","accessionNumber":"19078735","htmlLink":"/document/8871619/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Squeezing the Last MHz for CNN Acceleration on FPGAs","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"471800a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074006S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863849","isNumber":"8871487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863849","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8871487","articleId":"8871619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871665,"authors":[{"name":"Karina Fors","affiliation":["Swedish Defence Research Agency, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karina","lastName":"Fors","id":"37395893600"},{"name":"Erik Axell","affiliation":["Swedish Defence Research Agency, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Axell","id":"37586919900"},{"name":"Sara Linder","affiliation":["Swedish Defence Research Agency, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Linder","id":"37430426700"},{"name":"Peter Stenumgaard","affiliation":["Swedish Defence Research Agency, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Stenumgaard","id":"37275465800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0594-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0593-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0364"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-0356"}],"articleNumber":"8871665","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871665","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","5G mobile communication","Parity check codes","Long Term Evolution","Electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","digital audio broadcasting","digital video broadcasting","Gaussian noise","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","5G NR release 15 standard","5G NR system","CW interference","received signal","single CW signal","interfering signal","interference signal","orthogonal frequency division multiplex","fourth generation mobile system LTE","long term evolution","wireless local area network standard","digital video broadcasting","fifth generation mobile system","continuous wave interference","synchronized CW signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Continuous wave","OFDM","limiter"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) is used in several modern wireless systems, for example in the fourth generation mobile system LTE (long term evolution), the wireless local area network (WLAN) standard IEEE 802.11, digital audio broadcasting (DAB) and digital video broadcasting (DVB). OFDM has also recently been included in the standard for the fifth generation mobile system, 5G.In this work, we analyze the vulnerability of 5G NR to different types of continuous wave (CW) interference, both a single CW signal or several synchronized CW signals. The analysed system includes OFDM and error correction by LDPC codes, with parameters chosen to resemble those of the 5G NR release 15 standard. An important conclusion of this work is that the 5G NR system is significantly more sensitive to CW interference than to white Gaussian noise. To improve the robustness against CW interference, different types of limiters on the received signal are also evaluated. Limiters in the frequency domain are shown to mitigate the impact from a single CW signal significantly. For an interfering signal consisting of several CW signals, a limiter in the time domain can reduce the impact of the interference signal so that its impact is below that of Gaussian noise with the same power.","doi":"10.1109/EMCEurope.2019.8871665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMCEurope.2019.8871665","publicationTitle":"2019 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel7/8852528/8871448/08871665.pdf","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Impact of CW interference on 5G NR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of CW interference on 5G NR","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8871665/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19065917","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871665/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of CW interference on 5G NR","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121325S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8852528","isNumber":"8871448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8852528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8871448","articleId":"8871665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8871822,"authors":[{"name":"Abu Sebastian","affiliation":["IBM Research, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Abu","lastName":"Sebastian","id":"37320446800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0469-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0470-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8871822","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Memory Computing using Electrical and Photonic Memory Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8871822","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","Performance evaluation","Phase change memory","Compressed sensing","Explosives","Artificial intelligence","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","memristors","neural chips","neural nets","phase change materials","phase change memories","random-access storage","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photonic memory devices","data-centric artificial intelligence workloads","CMOS scaling laws","brain-inspired architectures","computational tasks","conventional electrical domain","resistive memory devices","memristive devices","computational memory unit","phase-change memory devices","matrix-vector multiplications","low computational complexity","matrix-vector multiplication operations","high-precision processing units","arbitrarily high precision","nonvon Neumann computing","in-memory computing paradigm"]}],"abstract":"Given the explosive growth in data-centric artificial intelligence workloads and the imminent end of CMOS scaling laws, it is becoming increasingly clear that we need to transition to brain-inspired architectures where memory and processing are collocated. A first step in this direction could be in-memory computing whereby certain computational tasks are performed in place by exploiting the physical attributes of memory devices [1,2]. In the conventional electrical domain, emerging resistive memory devices or memristive devices could play a key role as elements of such a computational memory unit. For example, when organized in a cross-bar configuration, phase-change memory (PCM) devices can be used to perform matrix-vector multiplications with very low computational complexity [3]. An appealing application of this concept is for the problem of compressed sensing and recovery of high-dimensional signals [4]. This is an application in which the lack of precision arising from the matrix-vector multiplication operations is not prohibitive. However, in other applications such as solving systems of linear equations or training deep neural networks, the lack of precision could be a key challenge. To address this, the concept of mixed-precision in-memory computing was proposed, where through a judicious combination of high-precision processing units and computational memory, we can achieve arbitrarily high precision, while still retaining much of the benefits of non-von Neumann computing [5]. The in-memory computing paradigm has recently been extended to the optical domain whereby photonic memory devices based on phase-change materials are used to perform in-place multiply-accumulate operations [6].","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871822","publicationTitle":"2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8850908/8871430/08871822.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8871822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"In-Memory Computing using Electrical and Photonic Memory Devices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2019","accessionNumber":"19065513","htmlLink":"/document/8871822/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Memory Computing using Electrical and Photonic Memory Devices","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"jsi11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027828S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8850908","isNumber":"8871430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8850908","xplore-issue":"8871430","articleId":"8871822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8871832,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Kamalian-Kopae","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Kamalian-Kopae","id":"37087051271"},{"name":"A.

However, there is yet so much unknown about fundamental properties and traits of a communication based on NFT. One of the most important aspects of an optical communication system is its robustness against the inevitable amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise coming from optical amplifiers. The ASE noise not only contaminates the signal as it does for all systems, but it also has a special detrimental effect on NFT-based systems; destroying the very basic concept of integrability of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). Moreover, this noise, undergoing a nonlinear transformation, i.e. \"direct NFT\" is dependent on the signal power. There are initial studies to model the noise in the nonlinear Fourier domain and some approximations for particular cases of modulation such as discrete spectrum-only or continuous spectrum-only modulations are available [2-3]. The limited extent of the mentioned studies makes it difficult to use them in order to design an optimum receiver - the primary engineering purpose of analysing the noise properties. On the other hand, machine learning-based techniques to study the noise characteristics in fibre-optic communication have been tried and promising results are already obtained [4]. Machine learning (ML) can also be used to find the impact of noise and alleviate the extent of its perturbation. In particular, in an NFT-based system, where data is mapped on the discrete spectrum (DS) of a signal, at the receiver, the calculated DS contains some spurious elements which are the result of the noise. These points are usually filtered out considered to be void of useful information about the transmitted signal. However, the correlation between these points and the main elements of the DS points that there is mutual information which can be used in order to improve the detection performance at the receiver. In this work, we use a simple Neural Network (NN) to back-propagate the received DS of a signal in a periodic NFT-based communication system. As shown in Fig1. a, drawn from a 64-QAM constellation, each symbol is mapped on the DS of a periodic signal as described in [5,6]. Performing the exact inverse transformation, a signal with the given DS is constructed and sent to a noisy link with 11 spans of 80 km length standard SMF.

Supercontinuum (SC) sources are nowadays widely used as fundamental building blocks in systems enabling a multitude of technologies such as optical frequency metrology, optical coherence tomography and broadband spectroscopy to name a few. Highly nonlinear fibers (HNLF) make up an excellent platform for SC generation as they not only offer high nonlinearity, but also dispersion-engineering and broadband single-mode operation. Broad SC are easily obtained by injecting ultrashort pulses into the anomalous dispersion regime of the HNLF, where the initial propagation is characterized by temporal compression and spectral broadening through solitonic effects. However, after compression each launched pulse tend to fission into several pulses, a process that is very sensitive to noise and can therefore lead to increased shot-to-shot fluctuations. Here, we experimentally show that these fluctuations can be mitigated by reducing the length of the HNLF, thus restricting the interaction -length dominated by pulse fi ssion and subsequent interactions [3]. A schematic of the setup, based on Raman -shifted and amplified 1.55-\u03bcm ultrashort pulses. The stability of the generated SC was investigated by Dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) measurements of the output from HNLFs of different lengths. Superimposed DFT-spectra, which show that the spectral fluctuations increase for longer HNLFs. We also studied the linear correlation maps (CM) for the recorded spectra, two of which are given. These visualize how different parts of the spectra fluctuate relative to each other, with yellow (blue) regions for wavelength pairs jittering in the same (opposite) manner, and thus give some insight into spectral deformations between consecutive pulses. The CM for the 5 cm HNLF is characterized by checker patterns along the main diagonal, corresponding to fluctuations around distinct spectral features, that are mutually correlated -as seen by the off -diagonal regions. This is in contrast to many of the off -diagonal regions in the CM for the 80 cm HNLF, which show an appreciable amount of anti-correlation between different checker-like patterns along the main diagonal. As a consequence, the spectral shape changes more noticeably between consecutive pulses, which is reflected by the increased colored area. This demonstrates a simple way of improving the shot-to-shot stability of anomalous dispersion HNLFs.

The proposed method has two operation modes, one is a resolution measurement mode and the other is a phase difference measurement mode. The resolution measurement mode is performed first to check the resolution of the TDC circuit. The phase difference measurement mode checks the timing difference between the original clock and the generated test clock. Evaluation experiments using a real FPGA device shows that the resolution of the proposed clock validation method using a TDC is 50.46 ps.

On the other hand, it requires a large number of measurements of ROs for all FPGAs before shipping, and thus leads to measurement cost inflation. In this research, we propose a low-cost recycled FPGA detection method using a virtual probe (VP) technique based on compressed sensing. The VP technique enables us to accurately predict the spatial process variation on a die from a very small number of sample measurements. Using the estimated process variation as a supervisor, machine-learning algorithm classifies target FPGAs into recycled or fresh. Through experiments using circuit simulation, our method achieves more than 96% detection accuracy using one-class support vector machine where only 20% samples of the frequency are used at the best case. Silicon measurement results on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs also demonstrate the efficiencies of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ITC-Asia.2019.00031","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Test Conference in Asia (ITC-Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Test Conference in Asia (ITC-Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863849/8871487/08872109.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITC-Asia.2019.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8872109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Cost Recycled FPGA Detection Using Virtual Probe Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8872109/","displayDocTitle":"Low Cost Recycled FPGA Detection Using Virtual Probe Technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8872109/","publicationDate":"Sep 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19078729","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Cost Recycled FPGA Detection Using Virtual Probe Technique","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"471800a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0675S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863849","isNumber":"8871487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863849","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8871487","articleId":"8872109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8872133,"authors":[{"name":"Danielle Duvalsaint","affiliation":["Advanced Chip Test Laboratory"],"firstName":"Danielle","lastName":"Duvalsaint","id":"37087049293"},{"name":"Zeye Liu","affiliation":["Advanced Chip Test Laboratory"],"firstName":"Zeye","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086090675"},{"name":"Ananya Ravikumar","affiliation":["Advanced Chip Test Laboratory"],"firstName":"Ananya","lastName":"Ravikumar","id":"37087051564"},{"name":"Ronald D.

To mitigate these threats, various design-for-trust techniques have been developed, including sequential logic locking. Sequential logic locking protects a non-scanned design by employing a key-controlled entrance FSM, key-controlled transitions, or a combination of both techniques. Current methods for characterizing (attacking) the security of sequentially locked circuits do not have the scalability to be applicable to modern circuits. In addition, current methods often require the use of an oracle, which is a working, unlocked circuit that is assumed to be fully initializable and controllable. In this work, an oracle-free, ATPG-based approach is proposed for characterizing the security of a locked sequential circuit. This method is of several in a tool box called CLIC-A (Characterization of Locked ICs via ATPG). Experiments using CLIC-A demonstrate it is effective at recovering the key sequence from various sequentially locked circuits that have been locked using different locking methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8872133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","publicationDate":"Sep 2019","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8872133/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19078717","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Locked Sequential Circuits via ATPG","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Locked Sequential Circuits via ATPG","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"471800a097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067219S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863849","isNumber":"8871487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863849","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8871487","articleId":"8872133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8872136,"authors":[{"name":"Patricia G\u00f3mez de Francisco","affiliation":["Radiofrequency Area National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Patricia G\u00f3mez","lastName":"de Francisco","id":"37087054761"},{"name":"David Poyatos Martinez","affiliation":["Radiofrequency Area National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Poyatos Martinez","id":"38270861600"},{"name":"Borja Plaza Gallardo","affiliation":["Operation Directorate Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas para la Defensa de Espa\u00f1a as external consultant for INTA, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Borja Plaza","lastName":"Gallardo","id":"37087050283"},{"name":"David Escot Bocanegra","affiliation":["Radiofrequency Area National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Escot Bocanegra","id":"38276942600"},{"name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez Romero","affiliation":["Payloads and Space Sciences Department, National Institute for A erospace Technology (INTA), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez","lastName":"Romero","id":"38253641600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0594-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0593-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0595-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0364"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-0356"}],"articleNumber":"8872136","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8872136","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fixtures","Aircraft","Transmission line measurements","Electromagnetics","Reverberation chambers","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace materials","aircraft manufacture","carbon fibre reinforced composites","electromagnetic shielding","IEC standards","laminates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shielding effectiveness measurement","aeronautical multiply laminates","aircraft construction","electromagnetic environments","IEC 61000-4-21 standards","ASTM D4935 standards","carbon fiber composite materials fabrication","C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASTM D4935","IE 61000-4-21","Electromagnetic characterization","Shielding Materials","Shielding Effectiveness","Coaxial Tester","Aeronautical Materials","Carbon Fiber Composites","Reverberation Chamber."]}],"abstract":"Modern aircraft employ profusely carbon fiber composites (CFC) for their construction. Then, it is mandatory to characterize the behaviour of this kind of materials for its use under harsh electromagnetic environments. In that sense, this paper presents the application of two standards, the ASTM D4935 and the IEC 61000-4-21, to the measurement of the shielding effectiveness (SE) of aeronautical multi-ply CFC laminates frequently used for the construction of aircraft. Each technique is well suited for a specific material or realization and a specific frequency range. So, both techniques are complementary and should be developed in parallel. Taking into account the high SE expected for this kind materials, the set-ups imply the measurement of very low signals, that poses an experimental challenge that has to be faced. Then, in this study, different test samples and realizations of CFC materials have been fabricated and measured. Improvements on the traditional measurement procedures have been applied, obtaining promising results.","doi":"10.1109/EMCEurope.2019.8872136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMCEurope.2019.8872136","publicationTitle":"2019 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel7/8852528/8871448/08872136.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations in the Measurement of the Shielding Effectiveness of Aeronautical Multi-ply CFC Laminates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8872136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Limitations in the Measurement of the Shielding Effectiveness of Aeronautical Multi-ply CFC Laminates","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19065995","htmlLink":"/document/8872136/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations in the Measurement of the Shielding Effectiveness of Aeronautical Multi-ply CFC Laminates","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055836S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8852528","isNumber":"8871448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8852528","xplore-issue":"8871448","articleId":"8872136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8872188,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Tanner","affiliation":["Laser Physics and Photonic Devices Laboratories, University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Tanner","id":"37087050259"},{"name":"Wen Qi Zhang","affiliation":["Laser Physics and Photonic Devices Laboratories, University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Wen Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086249652"},{"name":"Terence Chan","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Terence","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085614610"},{"name":"Tanya M.

Recently, we have reported new hybrid OFDM-DFMA PONs [1], where DSP-based digital filtering is employed for individual OFDM signals from various ONUs, and a single FFT operation and following data recovery processes are implemented in the OLT. Hybrid OFDM-DFMA PONs not only support good backward compatibility to OFDM-based 4G networks, but also offers various DSP-enabled SDN solutions of low complexity to meet the stringent requirements of 5G networks. However, due to multiple subcarrier modulation, OFDM suffers from a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which requires highly linear dynamic ranges of certain properties of modulators and amplifiers. To mitigate this problem, discrete-Fourier-transform (DFT)-spread OFDM is widely considered, which decreases the probability of independently modulated subcarriers being added up coherently by the IFFT [2]. DFT-spread OFDM has been applied in 4G standards [3]. In this paper, utilizing low-cost direct modulated DFB laser (DML)-based ONUs, DFT-spread hybrid OFDM-DFMA PONs is proposed and numerically explored, for the first time, to further enhance low-cost device-enabled network transmission performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DFT-Spread Hybrid OFDM-DFMA PONs Incorporating Directly Modulated DFB Laser-Based ONUs","publicationTitle":"2019

This has been the main motivation for probabilistic shaping (PS), i.e., the development of practical transmission schemes that use non-uniform distributions at the input of the channel. Many different PS schemes have been proposed, see, e.g., the literature review in [1, Section II], An important milestone for making PS practical was the invention of probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) [1], which concatenates a shaping outer code called a distribution matcher (DM) [2] and a forward error correction (FEC) inner code, see Fig. 1. The PAS architecture has three properties that distinguishes it from other proposed PS schemes. First, it integrates shaping with existing FEC, second, it achieves the Shannon limit, third, it adapts its rate by changing the probability distribution, while leaving the FEC part unchanged. Because of these three properties, PAS plays an important role in coherent optical transmission systems. The benefits of PAS were first demonstrated in optical transmission experiments [3] and then confirmed in field trials [4], [5].","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8850908/8871430/08873256.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8873256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8873256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871430","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Shaping and its Applications for Optical Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Probabilistic logic","Adaptive optics","Optical fiber communication","Communication channels","Bibliographies","Technological innovation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","concatenated codes","forward error correction","optical communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution matcher","forward error correction inner code","PAS architecture","probability distribution","coherent optical transmission systems","optical transmission experiments","optical communications","communication channels","nonuniform capacity-achieving input distributions","practical transmission schemes","nonuniform distributions","PS schemes","probabilistic amplitude shaping","shaping outer code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Shaping and its Applications for Optical Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873256/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"19065587","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Shaping and its Applications for Optical Communications","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ci13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064888S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8850908","isNumber":"8871430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8850908","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8871430","articleId":"8873256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8873418,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanjun Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7384/8873416/8873418/zhao.a1-2945210-small.gif","p":["Yuanjun Zhao received the Bachelor degree and Master degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

Although a natural application is using them as memory units, there have been several works in the literature showing their utilization in circuits and systems. While research on various aspects of memristive circuits and systems has been proliferating, the majority of these works are based on simulations at different levels of modeling abstraction. Simulation is a very helpful design tool, and there have been several efforts in modeling memristors; however, we contend that at this point these simulations represent the reality of the behavior of memristors, especially in a circuit or system set-up, only to a very limited extent. We show how this negatively affects the reproduction of designed circuits and systems in different simulation levels, and more importantly in a real-world set-up with physical implementation. Following that, we look into some considerations which can improve the reproducibility of the circuits and systems to be designed in the future. We conclude the paper by suggesting certain approaches to tackle these practical challenges at device level as well as circuit and system level.","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.2019.2945209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.2019.2945209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/7384/8873416/08873419.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Behavioral Design of Memristive Circuits and Systems to Physical Implementations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2019","displayDocTitle":"From Behavioral Design of Memristive Circuits and Systems to Physical Implementations","volume":"19","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2019","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873419/","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873419/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Behavioral Design of Memristive Circuits and Systems to Physical Implementations","sourcePdf":"19mcas04-taherinejad-2945209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177008S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"8873416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8873416","articleId":"8873419","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8873434,"authors":[{"name":"Yongcheng Cui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yongcheng","lastName":"Cui","id":"37087054104"},{"name":"Wenyong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Wenyong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087046055"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1223-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1222-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1224-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8873434","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"abstract":"In today's society, even though the technology is so developed, the coloring of computer images has remained at the manual stage. As a carrier of human culture and art, film has existed in our history for hundred years. With the development of science and technology, movies have developed from the simple black-and-white film era to the current digital age. There is a very complicated process for coloring old movies. Aside from the traditional hand-painting techniques, the most common method is to use post-processing software for coloring movie frames. This kind of operation requires extraordinary skills, patience and aesthetics, which is a great test for the operator. In recent years, the extensive use of machine learning and neural networks has made it possible for computers to intelligently process images. Since 2016, various types of generative adversarial networks models have been proposed to make deep learning shine in the fields of image style transfer, image coloring, and image style change. In this case, the experiment uses the generative adversarial networks principle to process pictures and videos to realize the automatic rendering of old documentary movies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications

execution in cloud systems was studied in this paper. When there were large-scale random tasks in the cloud computing system, the concepts of the task endurance value and the relaxation time were introduced, and the task waiting time was reduced by adjusting the task allocation resources. The task endurance value was calculated according to parameters such as the current network importance level of the tasks and the execution time of the tasks in the cloud system. Based on this, a resource scheduling algorithm based on task endurance value was proposed.

When pedestrians interact with a vehicle, they follow specific motion patterns based on their intentions. This work presents a conditional generative adversarial network based architecture that explicitly model human intention as a conditional variable to robustly learn the multi-modal nature of pedestrian motion for accurate future trajectory prediction. The generator in our framework uses a LSTM encoder-decoder conditioned on human intention for motion prediction while the discriminator consisting of a LSTM classifier learns to distinguish whether a predicted trajectory is consistent with a given intention. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, it demonstrates that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average displacement error of predicted positions. Additionally, qualitative analysis shows that our model is capable of predicting a multi-modal distribution with respect to human intentions.","doi":"10.1109/ICAICA.2019.8873455","pdfPath":"/iel7/8851232/8873431/08873455.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications (ICAICA)","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications (ICAICA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICA.2019.8873455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intent-Aware Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Pedestrian Path Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"Intent-Aware Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Pedestrian Path Prediction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19065600","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8873455/","conferenceDate":"29-31 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intent-Aware Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Pedestrian Path Prediction","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"CA008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071812S","chronDate":"29-31 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8851232","isNumber":"8873431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8851232","xplore-issue":"8873431","articleId":"8873455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8873458,"authors":[{"name":"Changlong Li","affiliation":["School of mechanical engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changlong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086638201"},{"name":"Sizhong Chen","affiliation":["School of mechanical engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sizhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535882100"},{"name":"Yuzhuang Zhao","affiliation":["School of mechanical engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhuang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37897017800"},{"name":"Yong Chen","affiliation":["School of mechanical engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086640995"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1223-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1222-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1224-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8873458","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873458","abstract":"In this paper, a type of recurrent neural network, long-short term memory (LSTM) network is applied to identify different classes of sequential vehicle acceleration signals, which underlies active suspension control strategies.

Focus on the detection of abnormal crowd behavior has been heightened in the field of computer vision. To solve this problem, the predictive neural network is innovatively applied to crowd anomaly detection by enlarging the differences between predictive frames and real frames in moving object regions. Firstly, aiming at the drawback of slow convergence speed of running Gaussian average model for object detection, an improved attenuation strategy based on learning rate is proposed. Then the processed foreground data set is put into the predictive neural network, and we define the degree of anomaly as the differences between predictive frames and real frames. By adjusting the threshold adaptively, the abnormal behavior in the crowd can be judged. The experimental results show that, compared with optical flow method and social force model, this method is not only fast in calculation, but also can detect crowd anomalies accurately and effectively. The accuracy rate of this method in UMN data set is up to 97.7%.","doi":"10.1109/ICAICA.2019.8873488","startPage":"221","endPage":"225","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications (ICAICA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8851232/8873431/08873488.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications (ICAICA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICA.2019.8873488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Abnormal Crowd Behavior Detection Based on Predictive Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Mathematical model","Force","Neural networks","Adaptation models","Anomaly detection","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","public administration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive neural network","malignant crowd incidents","public safety","public areas","abnormal crowd behavior","crowd anomaly detection","running Gaussian average model","object detection","crowd anomalies","abnormal crowd behavior detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["learning rate decay","predictive neural network","adaptive threshold","anomaly detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"Abnormal Crowd Behavior Detection Based on Predictive Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873488/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","conferenceDate":"29-31 March 2019","accessionNumber":"19065644","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Abnormal Crowd Behavior Detection Based on Predictive Neural Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"CA034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089701S","chronDate":"29-31 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8851232","isNumber":"8873431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8851232","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8873431","articleId":"8873488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8873522,"authors":[{"name":"Saisai Zhong","affiliation":["The College of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Saisai","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086702267"},{"name":"Yadong Liu","affiliation":["The College of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yadong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405160900"},{"name":"Zongtan Zhou","affiliation":["The College of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zongtan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37404367000"},{"name":"Dewen Hu","affiliation":["The College of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Dewen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37271079500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1223-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1222-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1224-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8873522","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Deep learning","Visualization","Recurrent neural networks","Functional magnetic resonance imaging","Mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","recurrent neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain activity","low Signal-Noise-Ratio","classification system","Recurrent Neural Networks","image stimuli","object image","classification accuracy","visual classification","recurrent neural network","viewed object","Brain-Computer Interface","high temporal resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)","single-trial","EEG"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873522","abstract":"Decoding the content of the viewed object from brain activity has always been an interesting topic in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).

Symbolic processing, performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification, resolution, and list operations, is learned by a combination of deep learning models, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge, the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations, (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols, and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2), handling of unknown data, which is a major task in artificial intelligence research, is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore, question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing, which, with conventional methods, is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data, including unknown data, on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial, there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of \u201cnewest\u201d. Therefore, to evaluate their efficiency, they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e., the Prolog system. This is new research that encompasses the subjects of conventional artificial intelligence and neural network, and their systems have higher potential to build applications such as FAQ chatbots, decision support systems and energy-efficient estimation using a large amount of information on the Web. Mining hidden information through these applications will provide great value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8873551/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087159","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Question Answering Systems With Deep Learning-Based Symbolic Processing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001697","fundingName":"Keio University"},{"fundingName":"KLL Ph.D. Program Research Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Question Answering Systems With Deep Learning-Based Symbolic Processing","sourcePdf":"access-honda-2948081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128396S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8873551","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8873552,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Gao","affiliation":["Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Gao","orcid":"0000-0002-6878-4812","id":"38577751100"},{"name":"Yinghui Zhang","affiliation":["Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Yinghui","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-7295-3738","id":"37086343852"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2169-3536"}],"articleNumber":"8873552","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/index.html"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"\u03c4-slotted ALOHA MAC protocol: Within the first \u03c4-slot, PT transmits their packets while PR and CSU receive the data packets from PT, and OSU keep silent.

How to improve the performance of that network has always been a popular research for the past decades. In this paper, we study the local delay and the throughput in cooperative cognitive radio ad hoc networks. In order to forward the packets of primary users, a \u03c4-slotted ALOHA protocol is adopted by secondary users in which a slot is divided into the first \u03c4-slot and the latter (1 - \u03c4)-slot. By modeling the location of primary and secondary users as homogeneous Poisson point processes, we give the closedform expression of the local delay and the throughput of both networks with two access strategies. Then, we optimize the two performance parameters with the intensity of secondary users. Numerical results show the feasibility of the optimal problem about the network performance metrics we proposed and could get an obvious better performance for primary users than that of ALOHA protocol by less sacrificing the performance of secondary users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"153230","endPage":"153237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08873552.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Local Delay and the Throughput in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","topic":"New Waveform Design and Air-Interface for Future Heterogeneous Network towards 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8873552/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Local Delay and the Throughput in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087237","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61761033, 61501325 and 61701345"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","grantNumber":"18JCZDJC31900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The Local Delay and the Throughput in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"access-gao-2948047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110177S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["New Waveform Design and Air-Interface for Future Heterogeneous Network towards 5G"],"articleId":"8873552","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8873554,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Taizhou University, Taizhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8873554/wang-2948017-small.gif","p":["Yang Wang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Zhejiang University of Technology, China, in 2002, and the M.S. degree in signal and information processing from Shanghai University, China, in 2005.

In this paper, a novel compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithm for real time dynamic MRI is proposed. The first frame with more k-space measurements is reconstructed precisely as the reference image. Different from previous methods who start their reconstructions from zero-filled k-space measurements, a Combined Fourier Transform (CFT) algorithm is implemented in our method, which can dynamically aggregate the k-space measurements from previous sampled frames to create a highly accurate predictive image for the current frame. We then combine the CFT algorithm with a 3D path-based dictionary leaning algorithm, which is named as DLCFT in our work for fast real time dMRI reconstruction. The proposed algorithm is compared with four state-of-the-art online and offline methods on two real and complex perfusion MR sequences and a real functional brain MR sequence. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms these methods with faster convergence and higher reconstruction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08873554.pdf","startPage":"150924","endPage":"150935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real Time Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging Via Dictionary Learning and Combined Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873554/","displayDocTitle":"Real Time Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging Via Dictionary Learning and Combined Fourier Transform","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087264","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873554/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY18F010005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Real Time Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging Via Dictionary Learning and Combined Fourier Transform","sourcePdf":"access-cao-2948017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111249S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8873554","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8873556,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Radio access network (RAN) slices, understood as isolated virtual networks that share a common infrastructure, are a possible answer to this very demanding scenario and enable virtual operators to provide differentiated services over independent logical entities. This article addresses the feasibility of forming 5G slices, answering the question of whether the available capacity (resources) is sufficient to satisfy slice requirements. As spectral efficiency is one of the key metrics in 5G networks, we introduce the minislot-based slicing allocation (MISA) model, a novel 5G slice resource allocation approach that combines the utilization of both complete slots (or physical resource blocks) and mini-slots with the adequate physical layer design and service requirement constraints. We advocate for a probabilistic characterization that allows to estimate feasibility and characterize the behavior of the constraints, while an exhaustive search is very computationally demanding and the methods to check feasibility provide no information on the constraints. In such a characterization, the concept of phase transition allows for the identification of a clear frontier between the feasible and infeasible regions. Our method relies on an adaptation of the Wang-Landau algorithm to determine the existence of, at least, one solution to the problem. The conducted simulations show a significant improvement in spectral efficiency and feasibility of the MISA approach compared to the slot-based formulation, the identification of the phase transition, and valuable results to characterize the satisfiability of the constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

The blockchain structure removes the barriers of a traditional centralized federation and offers a fully distributed and transparent administration by enforcing the involved agents to maintain consensus on the data. For a blockchain-based federation, it is vital to avoid blind-trust on the claimed SLA guarantees and monitor the quality of service which is highly desirable considering the multi-tenancy characteristic of cloud services. Due to the fact that the blockchain network is unable to access the outside world, it cannot handle, by its own, providers misbehavior in terms of SLA violations. Thus, we introduce oracle as a verifier agent to monitor the quality of the service and report to the smart contract agents deployed on the blockchain. Oracle is a trusted third-party agent who can communicate with the outside world of the blockchain network. The interaction between cloud service providers (either providing a service or requesting it from another provider) and the oracle through smart contracts comprises a system of autonomous and utility maximizer agents. Cloud requesters seek to receive high quality services with constant monitoring at cheap prices or even with no charge, while cloud providers aim to have a balanced work-load with less preserved capacity, and the oracle tends to charge higher for their monitoring services. Therefore, to model this conflicting situation, we formulate a dynamic Stackelberg differential game to optimize the cost of using the oracle and maximize the profit of the agents with the role of provider agent as a leader, and the requester and verifier agents as followers. Our designed Stackelberg differential game can seize the dynamicity of users' demand and resource provisioning in a competitive cloud market. We implemented our proposed decentralized model using the Solidity language in the remix IDE on the Ethereum network. We further evaluated the optimal controls and agents' profit with real-world data simulated for three concrete cloud providers. The results revealed that the requester agent initiates most of the quality verification requests at the beginning to the middle time of the contract. Thus, the provider agent could reserve less computing resources considering the fact that it could share the workload among other customers' computing resources during the peak-time. Moreover, imposing a higher penalty on the provider agent increased the capacity and decreased the number of requests for quality verification at the equilibrium. The evaluation also disclosed that the impact of timing in the dynamic pricing strategy of the verifier agent is very minimal, and the provisioning capacity of the provider is strongly correlated with the monitoring price.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2019.2948010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2019.2948010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/9061109/08873576.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9061109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Blockchain-Based Model for Cloud Service Quality Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Blockchain-Based Model for Cloud Service Quality Monitoring","volume":"13","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2020","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","accessionNumber":"19551827","htmlLink":"/document/8873576/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Blockchain-Based Model for Cloud Service Quality Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tsc-taghavi-2948010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146377S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9061109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9061109","articleId":"8873576","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8873588,"authors":[{"name":"Taha Selim Ustun","affiliation":["Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, AIST (FREA), Koriyama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8873588/ustun-2948117-small.gif","p":["Taha Selim Ustun received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.","He was an Assistant Professor of electrical engineering with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

Deployment of more intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and the communication lines increase the probability of such attacks. IEC 61850 standard facilitates communication between different IEDs and eases interoperable operation with set data and message structures. An unwanted consequence of this standardized communication over ethernet is increased viability to cyber threats. Replay and masquerade attacks are, especially, of concern due to their imminent impact on the operation. While detecting replay attacks is easier, since the original messages are used for the attack, masquerade attack messages may be difficult to distinguish from original ones. Furthermore, inadequate mitigation approaches may be tricked by the hackers and the system starts the attacker as the authentic sender and discards original messages from authentic sources. It is vital to develop an approach that incorporates message authentication. In this fashion, when the hackers modify the message contents to by-pass security systems, the tampering can be detected, and the messages will be discarded. This paper analyses replay and masquerade attacks on IEC 61850 GOOSE messages and develops a solution to mitigates both of those. To detect modified messages, two distinct authentication mechanisms are utilized: RSA since it is the algorithm stipulated in IEC 62351-6 and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) due to its widespread use in smartgrid cybersecurity solutions. A full solution to mitigate GOOSE replay and masquerade attacks is developed based on the proposed framework in IEC 62351 standard. Full implementation is tested in the lab and results are included to show the viability of the solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08873588.pdf","startPage":"156044","endPage":"156053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach for Mitigation of Replay and Masquerade Attacks in Smartgrids Using IEC 61850 Standard","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEC Standards","Computer hacking","Digital signatures","Protocols","Substations","Circuit breakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","digital signatures","IEC standards","message authentication","open systems","power engineering computing","power system security","public key cryptography","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smartgrid cybersecurity solutions","power systems","cybersecurity threats","elliptic curve digital signature algorithm","intelligent electronic devices","IEC 62351 standard","modified messages","IEC 61850 GOOSE messages","message contents","message authentication","authentic sender","masquerade attack messages","replay attacks","standardized communication","message structures","communication lines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyber-physical systems","cybersecurity in power systems","IEC 61850","IEC 62351","digital signature algorithms","message integrity check"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for Mitigation of Replay and Masquerade Attacks in Smartgrids Using IEC 61850 Standard","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8873588/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087762","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fukushima Prefecture\u2019s Reconstruction Grant","grantNumber":"2019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Approach for Mitigation of Replay and Masquerade Attacks in Smartgrids Using IEC 61850 Standard","sourcePdf":"access-sm-2948117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056818S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8873588","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8873592,"authors":[{"name":"Zhinus Marzi","affiliation":["University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8962108/8873592/marzi-2947819-small.gif","p":["Zhinus Marzi received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2010, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in communications and signal processing from the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2019.

In this paper, we propose a novel anti-intelligent UAV jamming strategy, in which the ground users can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming. The problem is formulated as a stackelberg dynamic game, where the UAV jammer acts as a leader and the ground users act as followers. First, as the UAV jammer is only aware of the incomplete channel state information (CSI) of the ground users, for the first attempt, we model such leader sub-game as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Then, we obtain the optimal jamming trajectory via the developed deep recurrent Q-networks (DRQN) in the three-dimension space. Next, for the followers sub-game, we use the Markov decision process (MDP) to model it. Then we obtain the optimal communication trajectory via the developed deep Q-networks (DQN) in the two-dimension space. We prove the existence of the stackelberg equilibrium and derive the closed-form expression for the stackelberg equilibrium in a special case. Moreover, some insightful remarks are obtained and the time complexity of the proposed defense strategy is analyzed.

In order to harness the NC benefits, a more complicated problem called routing, spectrum, and network coding assignment (RSNCA) has to be solved, and in this article, we propose a priority-based multiobjective design for the RSNCA problem aiming at maximizing the network throughput in the constrained bandwidth capacity and simultaneously minimizing the spectrum link usage for accepted demands. The multiobjective design is based on the weighting method, and we present a rigorous analysis on the impact of weight coefficients to the priority of constituent objectives. The efficacy of our design proposal is benchmarked with reference ones based on the traditional single-objective model and for both coding and noncoding approaches on various realistic topologies. It is highlighted that the application of NC brings about considerable throughput enhancement, and furthermore, the multiobjective RSNCA design is highly more efficient than the single-objective RSNCA, as up to more than 50% saving on spectrum link usage could be attained.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2938590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9107507","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/9107507/08873601.pdf","endPage":"2369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Priority-Based Multiobjective Design for Routing, Spectrum, and Network Coding Assignment Problem in Network-Coding-Enabled Elastic Optical Networks","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2019.2938590","startPage":"2358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Priority-Based Multiobjective Design for Routing, Spectrum, and Network Coding Assignment Problem in Network-Coding-Enabled Elastic Optical Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873601/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2020","accessionNumber":"19669193","publicationDate":"June 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8873601/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Vingroup Innovation Foundation","grantNumber":"VINIF.2019.DA06"},{"fundingName":"Vingroup Innovation Foundation Annual Research","grantNumber":"VINIF.2019.DA06"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Priority-Based Multiobjective Design for Routing, Spectrum, and Network Coding Assignment Problem in Network-Coding-Enabled Elastic Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-dao-2938590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172571S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"9107507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9107507","articleId":"8873601","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8873602,"authors":[{"name":"Xingbo Lu","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8873602/lu-2948078-small.gif","p":["Xingbo Lu received the B.S. degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, in 2017.

In this paper, considering that a legitimate full-duplex (FD) eavesdropper tries to monitor a dubious multi-antenna system, we propose a covert pilot spoofing attack (PSA) scheme to enhance the legitimate eavesdropping performance by taking the channel training phase into consideration. For the proposed covert PSA scheme, the total error detection probability and optimal detection threshold of suspicious source are derived as the worst case for the considered monitoring system. Given the optimal detection threshold, the closed-form expressions of effective eavesdropping rate are also derived based on the results of detection at suspicious source. Furthermore, an optimal power allocation algorithm to maximize the effective eavesdropping rate is proposed under the covert PSA and transmission power constraints. Simulation results illustrate that the adversary's uncertain about channel state information (CSI) before channel estimation process, can be exploited by legitimate eavesdropper to cover the PSA without being detected. Therefore, the proposed covert PSA scheme can achieve a better performance with respect to effective eavesdropping rate and effectively combat with a suspicious multi-antenna system.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08873602.pdf","startPage":"151295","endPage":"151306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive Eavesdropping via Covert Pilot Spoofing Attack in Multi-Antenna Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Eavesdropping via Covert Pilot Spoofing Attack in Multi-Antenna Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873602/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19087152","htmlLink":"/document/8873602/","volume":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771487 and 61471393"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Proactive Eavesdropping via Covert Pilot Spoofing Attack in Multi-Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"access-lu-2948078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133657S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8873602","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8873605,"authors":[{"name":"Kaidi Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8935346/8873605/wang-2948105-small.gif","p":["Kaidi Wang (S\u201916) received the M.S. degree in communications and signal processing from Newcastle University, U.K., in 2014.

More particularly, users in the same cluster can receive signals simultaneously by using NOMA techniques, while time-division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are utilized among different clusters. By employing the weight factor, a weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated and decoupled into user clustering and power allocation problems, where two different schemes for time slot allocation are proposed. The formulated user clustering problems with user-based and cluster-based time slot allocation schemes are respectively considered as coalitional games in characteristic and partition formations, and solved by two different algorithms, where both low-complexity and global optimal methods are proposed. The properties, including complexity, convergence, stability and optimality, are analyzed. To further improve the system performance, the formulated power allocation problem is solved by a successive convex approximation (SCA) based iterative algorithm. Simulation results reveal that: i) the proposed hybrid NOMA system is capable of achieving promising gains over centralized NOMA-based and conventional TDMA-based frameworks; and ii) the developed algorithms can significantly improve the weighted sum rate compared with the random user structure and the fixed power allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

In this article we introduce a novel framework called blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication system (BPAS) that provides authentication automatically in VANETs and preserves vehicle privacy at the same time. This design is highly efficient and scalable. It does not require any online registration centre (except for system initialization and vehicle registration), and allows conditional tracing and dynamic revocation of misbehaving vehicles. In this article, we conduct an in-depth security analysis and a comprehensive performance evaluation (which is based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform) for our proposed framework. The results demonstrate that our framework is an efficient solution for the development of a decentralized authentication system in VANETs.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2948053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/9026988/08873608.pdf","startPage":"4146","endPage":"4155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2948053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9026988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BPAS: Blockchain-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Authentication System for Vehicular <i>Ad Hoc</i> Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"BPAS: Blockchain-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Authentication System for Vehicular <i>Ad Hoc</i> Networks","volume":"16","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2020","accessionNumber":"19428172","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8873608/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873608/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61932016, 61972294 and 61772377"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Protection","grantNumber":"2017B030301004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BPAS: Blockchain-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Authentication System for Vehicular <italic>Ad Hoc</italic> Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-he-2948053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091048S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"9026988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"9026988","articleId":"8873608","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":8873616,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Han Bae","affiliation":["Sangmyung University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun Han","lastName":"Bae","id":"37071916100"},{"name":"Jung Woo Baek","affiliation":["Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Woo","lastName":"Baek","id":"37085770748"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8873616","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873616","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Sensors","Radio frequency","Throughput","Markov processes","Receivers","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy harvesting","probability","queueing theory","radio networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet sojourn time","PU's channel occupancy probability","RF-powered SU","data packets","timely-delivery probability","SU performance","idle channel times","channel occupancy times","radio frequency- powered SU","delivery deadline","real-time status update packets","primary users","channel time","secondary user","RF energy harvesting","cognitive radio network","delay-constrained traffic","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","RF energy harvesting","timely-delivery probability","censored Markov chain"]}],"abstract":"We consider a cognitive radio network where a secondary user (SU) tries to opportunistically access the channel time unused by the primary users (PUs) to transmit real-time status update packets with delivery deadline.

Thus, there is a balance characterizing the SU performance in terms of channel occupancy probability of the PUs. We investigate the timely-delivery probability of data packets for the RF-powered SU.

In this paper, a sidelobe suppression approach (JSSA) to suppress the maximum SLL by jointly optimizing the locations and amplitude weights of the nodes is proposed. JSSA organizes the node positions according to the concentric circular antenna array for location optimization. Then, a novel algorithm called variation particle chicken swarm optimization (VPCSO) is proposed to further optimize the amplitude weights of the selected CB nodes. The proposed VPCSO introduces the variation mechanism and location learning mechanism to enhance the performance of the conventional chicken swarm optimization algorithm. Simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed location optimization approach is effective, and the maximum SLLs of beam patterns obtained by VPCSO are lower than that of other algorithms. Moreover, the energy consumption can be saved by VPCSO. In addition, electromagnetic (EM) simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed JSSA in EM environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19087303","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873635/","displayDocTitle":"JSSA: Joint Sidelobe Suppression Approach for Collaborative Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872158"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China","grantNumber":"61806083"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018M640283"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Development Plan Project of Jilin Province","grantNumber":"20190701019GH"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"JSSA: Joint Sidelobe Suppression Approach for Collaborative Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-sun-2948091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129789S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8873635","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8873637,"authors":[{"name":"Abebe Belay Adege","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8955685/8873637/adege-2948075-small.gif","p":["Abebe Belay Adege received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Department of Computer Science and Information Science from Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

Owing to the dynamic changes in the wireless networks and the exponential growth of the IoT products, which make it difficult to locate large quantities of users and devices, providing accurate tracking and trajectory predictions in open and highly condensed wireless networks is extremely difficult. An adaptive and scalable system is required to offer accurate location-based services (LBSs) for the success of IoT. To enhance the attainment of IoT, we propose a hybrid of principal component analysis (PCA) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms for mobility predictions in a wireless urban area. During the system development processes, we first collect an LTE signal from three unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs), the Wi-Fi signal strength from each reachable Wi-Fi access points (APs), and channel information from the Wi-Fi signal media. We then apply PCA to reduce the number of Wi-Fi features and to decrease signal noise. Next, we train the GRU algorithm to develop models that can predict the mobility of IoT device users. Finally, we evaluate the tracking and trajectory models. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we compare the common parameters of the GRU with those of other deep learning types. The proposed technique provides plausible and state-of-the-art results for mobility predictions of IoT devices in a wireless environment.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948075","startPage":"505","endPage":"517","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things

These image sensors are capable of perceiving intensity changes in optically modulated signals, driving the rapid development of optical camera communication (OCC). In this study, direct-current offset orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) was developed for a rolling shutter OCC system in order to improve the data transmission rates of OCC systems. Two DCO-OFDM OCC signal detection algorithms, namely the parabolic column vector selection (P-CVS) algorithm and the decomposition of extremely low frequency component (D-ELFC) algorithm, were proposed, along with a frequency-domain downsampling scheme, to eliminate the influence from both the blooming effect and shot noise. The experimental results, obtained after using a self-built DCO-OFDM OCC testbed with a general commercial smartphone camera, demonstrated that the D-ELFC algorithm outperformed in the bit error rate (BER) in comparison to the P-CVS algorithm and achieved a data transmission rate >22 kbps under the conditions of the BER being below the 20% forward error correction (FEC) limit and the illuminance being higher than 510 lux.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2948071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8877962/08873644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2948071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877962","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental DCO-OFDM Optical Camera Communication Systems With a Commercial Smartphone Camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental DCO-OFDM Optical Camera Communication Systems With a Commercial Smartphone Camera","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7906813","volume":"11","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19178281","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8873644/","impactStatement":"Recently, optical camera communication (OCC) has been widely studied and has become a candidate for incorporation in IEEE 802.15.7m.

We describe competing types of illumination (trans-illumination, reflectance, and differential reflectance) and data collection methods (continuous wave, time domain and frequency domain). Basic components (light sources, detection, and recording components) of fNIRS systems are presented. Advantages and limitations of fNIRS techniques are offered, followed by a list of very practical recommendations for its use. A variety of experimental and clinical studies with fNIRS are sampled, shedding light on many brain-related ailments. Finally, we describe and discuss a number of freely available analysis and presentation packages suited for data analysis. In conclusion, we recommend fNIRS due to its ever-growing body of clinical applications, state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique and manageable hardware requirements. It can be safely concluded that fNIRS adds a new arrow to the quiver of neuro-medical examinations due to both its great versatility and limited costs.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2019.2944351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/4664312/8963780/08873645.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8963780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2019.2944351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Newcomer's Guide to Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy Experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","displayDocTitle":"A Newcomer's Guide to Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy Experiments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873645/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2020","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19281001","pubMedId":"31634142","htmlLink":"/document/8873645/","volume":"13","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1565962 and 1539068"},{"fundingName":"German Research Foundations Cluster of Excellence Brainlinks-Braintools (EXC 1086)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Newcomer's Guide to Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy Experiments","sourcePdf":"rbme-mankodiya-2944351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.310182S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"8963780","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8963780","articleId":"8873645","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8873653,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud M.

In addition to the decentralized nature of the proposed coordination scheme, it provides three important features: 1) a maximized flexible asymmetrical voltage support that does not affect the active current injection of individual units at the time of the support, 2) maximum support point tracking of each unit considering current, voltage, and power constraints, and 3) guided dynamic movement of the support points for each unit. The proposed scheme is examined in a practical test system, adapted from Hydro One medium-voltage distribution system in Ontario, Canada.

It is often assumed that regular pilots (RP), where a fraction of the time-frequency resources is reserved for pilots, suffices to provide high SE. However, the SE is limited by the pilot overhead and pilot contamination. An alternative is superimposed pilots (SP) where all resources are used for pilots and data. This removes the pilot overhead and reduces pilot contamination by using longer pilots. However, SP suffers from data interference that reduces the SE gains. This paper proposes the Massive-MIMO Iterative Channel Estimation and Decoding (MICED) algorithm where partially decoded data is used as side-information to improve the channel estimation and increase SE. We show that users with precise data estimates can help users with poor data estimates to decode. Numerical results with QPSK modulation and LDPC codes show that the MICED algorithm increases the SE and reduces the block-error-rate with RP and SP compared to conventional methods. The MICED algorithm with SP delivers the highest SE and it is especially effective in scenarios with short coherence blocks like high mobility or high frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2947906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2947906","startPage":"854","endPage":"870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8999755/08873655.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8999755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive-MIMO Iterative Channel Estimation and Decoding (MICED) in the Uplink","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Massive-MIMO Iterative Channel Estimation and Decoding (MICED) in the Uplink","volume":"68","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2020","accessionNumber":"19354642","publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8873655/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ELLIIT and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive-MIMO Iterative Channel Estimation and Decoding (MICED) in the Uplink","sourcePdf":"tcomm-verenzuela-2947906-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096328S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8999755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8999755","articleId":"8873655","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8873660,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Tran Anh Quang","affiliation":["Inria, Univ.

This topic has been well-studied in existing literature, however, its complexity and uncertainty of available information unveil challenges for researchers and engineers. In this paper, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning techniques for the placement of VNF-FGs. However, it turns out that even the most well-known learning technique is ineffective in the context of a large-scale action space. In this respect, we propose approaches to find out feasible solutions while improving significantly the exploration of the action space. The simulation results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed learning approach for this category of problems. Moreover, thanks to the deep learning process, the performance of the proposed approach is improved over time.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2019.2947905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/8930332/08873660.pdf","startPage":"1318","endPage":"1331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2019.2947905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for VNF Forwarding Graph Embedding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for VNF Forwarding Graph Embedding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873660/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19334791","htmlLink":"/document/8873660/","volume":"16","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for VNF Forwarding Graph Embedding","sourcePdf":"tnsm-pham-2947905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155028S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8930332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8930332","articleId":"8873660","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8873662,"authors":[{"name":"Vlad Dr\u0103goi","affiliation":["Faculty of Exact Sciences, Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad, Arad, Romania","LITIS, University of Rouen Normandy, Mont-Saint-Aignan, France"],"firstName":"Vlad","lastName":"Dr\u0103goi","orcid":"0000-0002-8673-9097","id":"37086283554"},{"name":"Valeriu Beiu","affiliation":["Faculty of Exact Sciences, Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad, Arad, Romania"],"firstName":"Valeriu","lastName":"Beiu","orcid":"0000-0001-8185-956X","id":"37270882100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8873662","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability theory","Nickel","Reliability engineering","Upper bound","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","network coding","polar codes","Reed-Muller codes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bhattacharyya parameter","network theory","polar codes construction","Reed-Muller codes","binary erasure polarization subchannels","network reliability","binary erasure channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","binary erasure channel","reliability polynomials","Bhattacharyya parameter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873662","abstract":"In this article we analyze the reliability of the synthetic channels of a polar code designed for the binary erasure channel, and in particular the properties of their Bhattacharyya parameter.

The circuit consists of a matching network, two shunt connected diodes with an integrated impedance compression network (IICN) and a dc-pass filter. The IICN significantly reduces the diode impedance variation when input power changes, hence improves matching as well as efficiency of the rectifier at wide input power dynamic range. Different from the conventional resistance/impedance compression networks, which can only work under certain impedance condition with dual-branch topology, the IICN can directly operate two diodes in parallel in a single-branch with no impedance limitation. Thus, less components and branch are needed, resulting in size reduction and lower circuit complexity. The design flexibility is also enhanced. Mechanism of the IICN is analyzed. A prototype operating at 2.45 GHz is optimized, fabricated and measured.

The objective is to determine optimal DER power injections that minimize the voltage excursions outside a desirable voltage range without knowing a complete model of the power distribution system. To this end, we approximate the nonlinear relationship between the voltage magnitudes and the power injections by a linear model. The parameters of this linear model-referred to as the voltage sensitivities-can be computed using information on the network topology and the line parameters, the values of which will be estimated. Assuming the knowledge of feasible network topology configurations and distribution line resistance-to-reactance ratios, we propose a framework for identifying the true network topology configuration and the corresponding line parameters using only a few measurements of voltage magnitudes and power injections. Utilizing the estimated voltage sensitivities, the optimal DER power injections can be readily determined by solving a convex optimization problem. Due to its data-driven nature, the proposed framework is intrinsically adaptive to changes in system conditions such as unknown topology reconfiguration. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated via numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus distribution test feeder.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Power distribution","Sensitivity","Topology","Reactive power","Voltage measurement","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","distributed power generation","electric resistance","load flow","power distribution control","power distribution lines","voltage control","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex optimization problem","distribution line resistance-to-reactance ratios","nonlinear relationship","voltage sensitivity","network topology configuration","voltage magnitudes","optimal DER power injections","distributed energy resources","radial power distribution systems","data-driven voltage regulation","IEEE 123-bus distribution test feeder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power distribution system","distributed energy resource","voltage regulation","line parameter estimation","topology estimation","data-driven control","sensitivity analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2948138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/9070029/08873667.pdf","startPage":"2133","endPage":"2143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9070029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2948138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Voltage Regulation in Radial Power Distribution Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Voltage Regulation in Radial Power Distribution Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873667/","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8873667/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19531393","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Voltage Regulation in Radial Power Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dominguezgarcia-2948138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125587S","chronDate":"May  2020","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"9070029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"9070029","articleId":"8873667","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8873668,"authors":[{"name":"Guangzhong Dong","affiliation":["School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/9046115/8873668/dong-2948018-small.gif","p":["Guangzhong Dong (S\u201917\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Eng. degree in automation and the Ph.D degree in control science and engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2013 and 2018, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

Wiener process-based degradation models and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction methods have the advantage of high flexibility and efficiency, with features such as Brownian motion with drift and scale parameters. They can also quantify prediction uncertainty through inverse Gaussian distribution. However, prior studies use offline-identified model parameters, which can result in difficulties in both model adaptability and health prognosis. To improve the performance of Wiener process models, this article proposes a new data-driven Brownian motion model that utilizes the adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) parameter identification method. The proposed model can update model parameters online and adapt to uncertain degradation operations. This data-driven method has the flexibility and efficiency of Brownian motion models but avoids their shortcomings in model adaptability and health prognosis. The model parameters and drift parameter are online estimated based on AEKF using limited historical system measurements. The effectiveness of the proposed data-driven framework in degradation modeling and RUL prediction is evaluated through simulations and experimental results on lithium-ion battery degradation data. The results show that the proposed approach has significant accuracy and robustness for both model adaptability and RUL prediction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Adaptation models","Batteries","Predictive models","Prognostics and health management","Data models","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filters","battery management systems","Brownian motion","data analysis","Gaussian distribution","lithium compounds","nonlinear filters","parameter estimation","remaining life assessment","secondary cells","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wiener process models","adaptive extended Kalman filter parameter identification method","drift parameter","lithium-ion battery degradation data","data-driven battery health prognosis","adaptive Brownian motion model","remaining useful life prediction method","inverse Gaussian distribution","AEKF","RUL prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Wiener process","degradation modeling","data-driven prediction","extended Kalman filtering","prognostics and health management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2948018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/9046115/08873668.pdf","startPage":"4736","endPage":"4746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9046115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2948018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Battery Health Prognosis Using Adaptive Brownian Motion Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Battery Health Prognosis Using Adaptive Brownian Motion Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873668/","volume":"16","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8873668/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19548679","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council Theme-based Research Scheme","grantNumber":"T32-101/15-R"},{"fundingName":"General Research Fund","grantNumber":"CityU 11206417"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Battery Health Prognosis Using Adaptive Brownian Motion Model","sourcePdf":"tii-yang-2948018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101823S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"9046115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"9046115","articleId":"8873668","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8873669,"authors":[{"name":"Ramon Maia Borges","affiliation":["Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, Brazil","Federal University of Itajub\u00e1, Itajub\u00e1, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Ramon Maia Borges received the M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees from Inatel, Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, Brazil, in 2015 and 2012, respectively.

To enhance security, jamming signals are transmitted from both the full-duplex legitimate UAV and non-offloading ground users. For this system, we design a low-complexity iterative algorithm to maximize the minimum secrecy capacity subject to latency, minimum offloading and total power constraints. Specifically, we jointly optimize the UAV location, users' transmit power, UAV jamming power, offloading ratio, UAV computing capacity, and offloading user association. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline strategies over a wide range of UAV self-interference (SI) efficiencies, locations and packet sizes of ground users. Furthermore, we show that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between the security and latency of UAV-enabled MEC systems which depends on the UAV SI efficiency and total UAV power constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2947921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8960485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2947921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8960485/08873672.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communications for UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communications for UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing Systems","volume":"68","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873672/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19266589","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP190100770"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP150104019 and DP190101988"},{"fundingName":"ARC Laureate Fellowship","grantNumber":"FL160100032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communications for UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhou-2947921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.195121S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8960485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8960485","articleId":"8873672","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8873678,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Qiumei","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8873678/qiume-2948112-small.gif","p":["Zheng Qiumei received the B.S. degree from the East China Petroleum Institute, China, in 1986, and the M.E. degree from the China University of Petroleum (East China), China, in 1999.

The objective is to find a policy that maps measurements of voltage magnitudes and topology information to LTC tap ratio changes so as to minimize the voltage deviation across the system. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and propose a data and computationally efficient batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to solve it. To circumvent the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d resulting from the large state and action spaces, we propose a sequential learning algorithm to learn an action-value function for each LTC, based on which the optimal tap positions can be directly determined. By taking advantage of a linearized power flow model, we propose an algorithm to estimate the voltage magnitudes under different tap settings, which allows the RL algorithm to explore the state and action spaces freely offline without impacting the system operation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via numerical simulations on the IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus distribution test feeders.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2948132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/9070029/08873679.pdf","startPage":"1990","endPage":"2001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2948132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9070029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Tap Setting of Voltage Regulation Transformers Using Batch Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873679/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Tap Setting of Voltage Regulation Transformers Using Batch Reinforcement Learning","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2020","accessionNumber":"19531410","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873679/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Tap Setting of Voltage Regulation Transformers Using Batch Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dominguezgarcia-2948132-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105153S","chronDate":"May  2020","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"9070029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"9070029","articleId":"8873679","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8873681,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Cryptology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8952812/8873681/zhang-2948113-small.gif","p":["Hua Zhang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering and the M.S. degree in cryptography from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in cryptography from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2008.","She is currently an Associate Professor of Cyber Security with BUPT.

As one of the critical industrial networks, the heterogeneous and real-time substation network lacks compatibility with the conventional cryptography architecture represented by secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) and public key infrastructure (PKI). To enhance the security of smart substations under the premise of low latency, in this article, we present a novel encryption-as-a-service architecture based on fog computing in this article. The architecture offloads encryption to dedicated devices and makes certificate and key management available through unified web services on the fog and cloud layers. Based on this architecture, we propose MX-SORTS, maximizing security on real-time communication of different services, an algorithm for adaptive configuration of encrypting and signing substation network traffic. By the contrast experiments with the conventional cryptography architecture, we prove that the encryption-as-a-service architecture can significantly improve the real-time and security performance of substation networks.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2948113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8952812/08873681.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2948113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Encryption-as-a-Service Architecture Based on Fog Computing for Real-Time Substation Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873681/","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Encryption-as-a-Service Architecture Based on Fog Computing for Real-Time Substation Communications","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19265632","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873681/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672110, 61671082, 61976024 and 61972048"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities","grantNumber":"2019XD-A01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Encryption-as-a-Service Architecture Based on Fog Computing for Real-Time Substation Communications","sourcePdf":"tii-qin-2948113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12188S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8952812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8952812","articleId":"8873681","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8873734,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Kum Jung","affiliation":["Institut f\u00efr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Bo Kum","lastName":"Jung","id":"37087049632"},{"name":"Nils Dreyer","affiliation":["Institut f\u00efr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Dreyer","id":"37086031994"},{"name":"Johannes M.

One of the goals of ThoR is to develop algorithms for automatic planning of 300 GHz backhaul links and the derivation of planning guidelines. In this paper, an automatic algorithm for the planning of 300 GHz backhaul links using 3D ray tracing taking into account atmospheric effects is presented. The influence of both the applied antennas and the weather conditions are evaluated for an automatically planned network by using a realistic scenario of an ultra-dense network in the city of Hannover.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864492/8873688/08873734.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8873734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8873734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and Automatic Planning of 300 GHz Backhaul Links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Base stations","Planning","Meteorology","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio links","ray tracing","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic planning","300 GHz backhaul links","European Horizon 2020 ThoR project","automatically planned network","3D ray tracing","frequency 300.0 GHz","bit rate 100.0 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and Automatic Planning of 300 GHz Backhaul Links","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079928","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and Automatic Planning of 300 GHz Backhaul Links","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4458329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04302S","chronDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","isNumber":"8873688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864492","citationCount":"8","articleId":"8873734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8873739,"authors":[{"name":"Longfei Yan","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Longfei","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086883835"},{"name":"Chong Han","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Han","id":"37085496399"},{"name":"Qing Ding","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institute of Terahertz Technology and Innovation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Ding","id":"37087052100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8285-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8286-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2035"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-2027"}],"articleNumber":"8873739","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Spectral efficiency","Power demand","Computer architecture","Complexity theory","Radio frequency","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceptable power consumption","array-of-subarray architecture","hybrid beamforming technology","hybrid beamforming architectures","terahertz communications","low hardware complexity","fully-connected architecture","dynamic array-of-subarray architecture","multiple hybrid beamforming architectures"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8873739","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8873739","publicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","abstract":"Hybrid beamforming technology is attractive for Terahertz (THz) communications to compensate the huge path loss, owing to the benefits of low hardware complexity and acceptable power consumption.

The proposed crossing structure is compact and has low loss and crosstalk within a broad band, which will pave the way for a wide range of new applications for THz integrated systems.","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8873971","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8873971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873688","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864492/8873688/08873971.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance and Low-Crosstalk Terahertz Plasmonic Crossings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8873971/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Performance and Low-Crosstalk Terahertz Plasmonic Crossings","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8873971/","accessionNumber":"19149263","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance and Low-Crosstalk Terahertz Plasmonic Crossings","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4423411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068282S","chronDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864492","isNumber":"8873688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864492","xplore-issue":"8873688","articleId":"8873971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8874016,"authors":[{"name":"Shahid Ullah","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Ullah","id":"37086518084"},{"name":"Cunjun Ruan","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory for Microwave Sensing and Security Applications, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cunjun","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37542410500"},{"name":"Tanveer Ul Haq","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tanveer Ul","lastName":"Haq","id":"37404696600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8285-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8286-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2035"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-2027"}],"articleNumber":"8874016","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Dual band","Microstrip","Microstrip antennas","Polarization","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antennas","microstrip lines","monopole antennas","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monopole antenna","short range communication applications","z-shape radiating element","z-shaped dual band circular polarized microstrip antenna","THz communication","terahertz antenna","left hand circular polarized antenna","left hand circular polarized antenna","microstrip line","frequency 0.19 THz to 0.24 THz","frequency 0.27 THz to 0.61 THz","bandwidth 340.0 GHz","bandwidth 15.0 GHz","bandwidth 50.0 GHz","bandwidth 110.0 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874016","publicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864492/8873688/08874016.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Z-Shaped Dual band Circular Polarized Microstrip Antenna for THz Communication","abstract":"In this paper a simple z-shaped dual band circular polarized (CP) terahertz (THz) monopole antenna is designed for short range communication applications.

The proposed array structure is constructed on three layers composed of Silicon-Ground-Silicon layers. The ground-plane has sandwiched between two silicon layers. Two antennas are implemented on the top layer, where each antenna is constituted from three sub-antennas. The sub-antennas are constructed from interconnected dual-rings. Also, the sub-antennas are interconnected to each other. This approach enlarges the effective aperture area of the array, which has caused to improve its performance parameters. Surface waves and substrate losses in the structure are suppressed with the metallic via-holes that have inserted through the three layers and implemented between the radiation elements. To excite the structure, a novel feeding mechanism is used comprising open-circuited microstrip lines located on the back side of the structure, which couple the electromagnetic energy from the bottom layer to the antennas on the top-layer through metasurface slot-lines in the middle ground-plane layer. The results show the proposed on-chip antenna array has an average radiation gain, efficiency, and isolation of 7.62 dBi, 32.67%, and -30 dB, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874127","publicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864492/8873688/08874127.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance On-Chip Array Antenna Based on Metasurface Feeding Structure for Terahertz Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High Performance On-Chip Array Antenna Based on Metasurface Feeding Structure for Terahertz Integrated Circuits","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19079844","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8874127/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874127/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","conferenceDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance On-Chip Array Antenna Based on Metasurface Feeding Structure for Terahertz Integrated Circuits","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4457939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042931S","chronDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864492","isNumber":"8873688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864492","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8873688","articleId":"8874127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8874151,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The concept relies on combining electrical phase shifting of a sparse array with a mechanical translation of an array of lenses. The use of a sparse phased array significantly simplifies the RF front-end, while the translation of a lens array steers the element patterns to angles off-broadside, reducing the impact of grating lobes over a wide FoV. The mechanical movement of the lens array can be done using a low-weight, low-power piezo-actuator. In order to achieve wide bandwidth and steering angles, a novel leaky wave feed concept is also introduced. A 540 GHz prototype is currently under fabrication.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864492/8873688/08874477.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scanning Lens Phased Array for Submillimeter Wavelengths","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lenses","Phased arrays","Silicon","Feeds","Prototypes","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","beam steering","lens antennas","lenses","microstrip antenna arrays","scanning antennas","submillimetre wave antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scanning lens","submillimeter wavelengths","hybrid electromechanical scanning antenna array architecture","highly directive phased arrays","field-of-views","electrical phase","sparse array","mechanical translation","sparse phased array","lens array","wide FoV","steering angles","frequency 540.0 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Scanning Lens Phased Array for Submillimeter Wavelengths","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080013","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scanning Lens Phased Array for Submillimeter Wavelengths","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4459435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029754S","chronDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","isNumber":"8873688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864492","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8874477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8874531,"authors":[{"name":"Guan Yang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37087046296"},{"name":"Zili Qin","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zili","lastName":"Qin","id":"37087052823"},{"name":"Yicai Ji","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yicai","lastName":"Ji","id":"37396616500"},{"name":"Guangyou Fang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangyou","lastName":"Fang","id":"37286479900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8285-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8286-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2035"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-2027"}],"articleNumber":"8874531","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"abstract":"In this paper, a fast back-projection (BP) algorithm based on time-delay surface correction (TSC) for two-dimensional arrays is proposed. For the range interpolation problem caused by the conventional BP algorithm, the echo data distance migration phase correction method is used to avoid range interpolation and improve the efficiency of BP algorithm while ensuring accurate target positioning. And the computational efficiency of the two methods is compared by the simulation. Then an array optimization design scheme using the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed for eliminating the grating lobes in the W-band sparse array. The feasibility of this method is verified by simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864492/8873688/08874531.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2019 44th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2019.8874531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8873688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"W-Band MIMO Radar Array Optimization and Improved Back-projection Algorithm for Far-Field Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Radar imaging","MIMO radar","Genetic algorithms","Three-dimensional displays","Gratings","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","backpropagation","genetic algorithms","interpolation","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar computing","radar imaging","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-band sparse array","Genetic Algorithm","Simulated Annealing algorithm","array optimization design scheme","computational efficiency","accurate target positioning","echo data distance migration phase correction method","range interpolation problem","two-dimensional arrays","TSC","time-delay surface correction","back-projection algorithm","MIMO radar array optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"W-Band MIMO Radar Array Optimization and Improved Back-projection Algorithm for Far-Field Imaging","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079717","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"W-Band MIMO Radar Array Optimization and Improved Back-projection Algorithm for Far-Field Imaging","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4421629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03345S","chronDate":"1-6 Sept. 2019","isNumber":"8873688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864492","articleId":"8874531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8874689,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The frontend consists of four independent receive paths, allowing to adjust each signal in amplitude and phase and combining them afterwards. This so called RF combining not only reduces the hardware effort compared to conventional MIMO receivers but also allows a combination of the beamforming frontend with any wireless system in the given frequency range. The ASIC measures 1.2 mm \u00d7 1.9 mm and was designed in a 180 nm BiCMOS technology. The circuit was integrated with complete digital control circuitry and consumes around 120 mW from a 3 V supply. Using this ASIC, a beamsteering FMCW radar system was built, proofing the benefit of analog beamsteering. Most importantly, an almost error free distance measurement in a non-line-of-sight scenario has been demonstrated, which is to our knowledge the first time reported in literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 European Microwave Conference in Central Europe (EuMCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858427/8874688/08874689.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8874688","publicationTitle":"2019 European Microwave Conference in Central Europe (EuMCE)","startPage":"419","endPage":"422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully integrated, four-element multi-standard beamforming ASIC for 2.4 and 5.8 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"A fully integrated, four-element multi-standard beamforming ASIC for 2.4 and 5.8 GHz","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874689/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8874689/","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"19078255","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully integrated, four-element multi-standard beamforming ASIC for 2.4 and 5.8 GHz","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"paper_21_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061101S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8858427","isNumber":"8874688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8858427","xplore-issue":"8874688","articleId":"8874689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMCE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8874692,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Jing","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Jing","id":"37086538712"},{"name":"Chao Yu","affiliation":["Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yu","id":"38488678000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-067-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1240-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8874692","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Mathematical model","Predistortion","5G mobile communication","Transmitters","Butler matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G massive MIMO transmitters","digital predistortion technique","multibeam scenario","5G massive multiple-input multiple-output transmitters","interference signal","exactly opposite signal","predistorted signal","target beam linearization","multiuser applications","5G mMIMO wireless systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion (DPD)","5G","multi-beam","massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)","power amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874692","publicationTitle":"2019 European Microwave Conference in Central Europe (EuMCE)","abstract":"In this paper, a novel digital predistortion (DPD) technique is proposed to linearize the target beam interfered with other beams in the multi-beam scenario of 5G massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) transmitters.

Outphasing class-E PAs offer high power efficiency and an option for higher efficiency cellular networks. However, they employ signal component separators, which split the signal into two paths. In order to efficiently recombine the signal, nonlinear power combiners are used. This paper proposes a novel phase-only predistortion technique for outphasing class-E PAs. The predistortion coefficients can be extracted based on AMAM characteristics of the output signal and an analytical model of an outphasing Class E PA. The suggested technique has been validated by simulation of an outphasing power amplifier in ADS Ptolemy software.

The data has been ported and processed on a graphical processing unit (GPU) to overcome the complexity issue of the matched filter approach.

It is intended for mm-wave applications at 180 GHz (G-band) and offers a gain of 17.7 dB and a bandwidth of 80 GHz. The design is optimized for a low noise figure of 7.5 dB and reaches medium output power levels, with a 1-dB compression point occuring at about 0 dBm. The total power consumption, including bias blocks, is 48 mW. The stability and bandwidth of the cascodes are improved with output matching networks employing inductive feedback from the collector to the base. An improved method, based on zero-ohm transmission lines, is used for realizing wideband ac-blocks with low equivalent series resistance.

Additionally, the trade-off relationship between the two parameters is revealed, which provides important insights regarding the potential of using energy storage to maintain voltage stability under high uncertainty. To this end, Stochastic Differential-Algebraic Equations (SDAEs) are used to model the stochastic load variation; bifurcation analysis is carried out to explain the influence of stochasticity. Numerical study and Monte Carlo simulations on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate that a larger fluctuation intensity or a slower load power variation speed may lead to a smaller voltage stability margin. To the best of authors' knowledge, this work uncovers the impacts of the time evolution property of the driving parameters, i.e., the load power variation speed and its trade off effect with the fluctuation intensity on the size of the dynamic voltage stability margin.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2943509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9049235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2943509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9049235/08874948.pdf","startPage":"1286","endPage":"1295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Study of the Impacts of Stochastic Load Fluctuation on the Dynamic Voltage Stability Margin Using Bifurcation Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Study of the Impacts of Stochastic Load Fluctuation on the Dynamic Voltage Stability Margin Using Bifurcation Theory","volume":"67","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8874948/","publicationDate":"April 2020","accessionNumber":"19488035","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874948/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"NSERC RGPIN-2016-04570"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003151","fundingName":"Fonds de Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Nature et Technologies","grantNumber":"FRQ-NT PR-253686"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004343","fundingName":"Stavros Niarchos Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Study of the Impacts of Stochastic Load Fluctuation on the Dynamic Voltage Stability Margin Using Bifurcation Theory","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wang-2943509-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122811S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9049235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9049235","articleId":"8874948","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8874972,"authors":[{"name":"Keke Gai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/9026988/8874972/gai-2948094-small.gif","p":["Keke Gai (S\u201913\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Eng. degree majored in automation from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2004, the Master's of Educational Technology degree in educational technology from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2010, the MBA degree in business administration, in 2009, the M.S. degree in information technology from the Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI, USA, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Pace University, New York, NY, USA, in 2017.","He is currently an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Technology with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China.

Benefits of applying edge computing is an adoptable complementarity for cloud computing; blockchain is an alternative for constructing transparent secure environment for data storage/governance. Instead of using these two techniques independently, in this article, we propose a novel approach that integrates IoT with edge computing and blockchain, which is called blockchain-based Internet of Edge model. The proposed model, designed for a scalable and controllable IoT system, sufficiently exploits advantages of edge computing and blockchain to establish a privacy-preserving mechanism while considering other constraints, such as energy cost. We implement experiment evaluations running on Ethereum. According to our data collections, the proposed model improves privacy protections without lowering down the performance in an energy-efficient manner.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2948094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2948094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/9026988/08874972.pdf","startPage":"4156","endPage":"4165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9026988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Privacy-Based Blockchain for Industrial Internet-of-Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Differential Privacy-Based Blockchain for Industrial Internet-of-Things","volume":"16","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2020","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19428170","htmlLink":"/document/8874972/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61972034"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"20D20116"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR201906140028"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012236","fundingName":"Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Privacy-Based Blockchain for Industrial Internet-of-Things","sourcePdf":"tii-zhu-2948094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125491S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"9026988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"9026988","articleId":"8874972","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8874979,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Sheth","affiliation":["University of South Carolina"],"bio":{"p":["Amit Sheth is the Founding Director of the AI Institute with the University of South Carolina.

The miniature T-type switch demonstrates three states of operation, including one crossover state and two turn states. A seven-layer microfabrication process, including an additional conductive layer to reduce the RC time constant due to the bias network routing, is developed and optimized to fabricate the multiport RF devices. A 4\u00d76 PCM-based redundancy switch matrix is developed by monolithically integrating four T-type switches in the cascade configuration. Thermal crosstalk in PCM switches is experimentally investigated using submicrometer spatial resolution transient thermal imaging. The presented T-type switch has the device periphery of 0.55 mm \u00d7 0.55 mm, while the overall integrated PCM redundancy switch matrix is fabricated with a device footprint of 0.88 mm \u00d7 1.1 mm. The measured results of the T-type switches demonstrate an excellent RF performance with lower than 1.6 dB insertion loss, better than 20 dB return loss, and higher than 20 dB isolation in all states from dc-67 GHz. The redundancy switch matrix exhibits an insertion loss less than 3 dB, return loss better than 14 dB, and isolation higher than 20 dB from dc-60 GHz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a PCM-based redundancy switch matrix.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2019.2944359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8946860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2019.2944359","endPage":"5190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8946860/08874988.pdf","startPage":"5181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniaturized DC\u201360 GHz RF PCM GeTe-Based Monolithically Integrated Redundancy Switch Matrix Using T-Type Switching Unit Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874988/","displayDocTitle":"Miniaturized DC\u201360 GHz RF PCM GeTe-Based Monolithically Integrated Redundancy Switch Matrix Using T-Type Switching Unit Cells","volume":"67","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"19244209","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8874988/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniaturized DC\u201360 GHz RF PCM GeTe-Based Monolithically Integrated Redundancy Switch Matrix Using T-Type Switching Unit Cells","sourcePdf":"tmtt-singh-2944359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061247S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8946860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8946860","articleId":"8874988","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8874990,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongxiang Wei","affiliation":["University College London, London, U.K"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8874990/wei-2946818-small.gif","p":["Zhongxiang Wei (S\u201915\u2013M\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Liverpool (UOL), Liverpool, U.K., in 2017.

Starting from full base station (BS) coordination, we first propose a fully-coordinated scheme to exploit beneficial effects of both inter-cell and intra-cell interference, based on sharing both channel state information (CSI) and data among the BSs. To reduce the coordination overhead, we then propose a partially-coordinated scheme where only intra-cell interference is designed to be constructive while inter-cell is jointly suppressed by the coordinated BSs. Accordingly, the coordination only involves CSI exchange and the need for sharing data is eliminated. To further reduce the coordination overhead, a third scheme is proposed, which only requires the knowledge of statistical inter-cell channels, at the cost of a slight increase on the transmission power. For all the proposed schemes, imperfect CSI is considered. We minimize the total transmission power in terms of probabilistic and deterministic optimizations. Explicitly, the former statistically satisfies the users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while the latter guarantees the SINR requirements in the worst case CSI uncertainties. Simulation verifies that our schemes consume much lower power compared to the existing benchmarks, i.e., coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and coordinated-beamforming (CBF) systems, opening a new dimension on multi-cell coordination.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19262643","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8874990/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Cell Interference Exploitation: Enhancing the Power Efficiency in Cell Coordination","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/R007934/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Cell Interference Exploitation: Enhancing the Power Efficiency in Cell Coordination","sourcePdf":"twc-wei-2946818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137481S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8874990","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8874991,"authors":[{"name":"Kechen Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8874991/zheng-2946813-small.gif","p":["Kechen Zheng received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2013 and 2018, respectively.

We are thus motivated to consider the energy harvesting cognitive radio networks (CRNs) consisting of multiple primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs). We introduce two cooperation modes: the energy cooperation mode and joint cooperation mode. In the energy cooperation mode, there only exists energy cooperation between PUs and SUs, i.e., the SU transmits its own packets by using the energy harvested from primary signals. In the joint cooperation mode, the SU relays primary packets by using the energy harvested from primary signals. In each cooperation mode of three representational scenarios (the CRN with one pair of PUs and one pair of SUs, the CRN with two pairs of PUs and one pair of SUs, and the CRN with one pair of PUs and two pairs of SUs) and the general scenario, we exploit the optimal time allocation between PUs and SUs, and balance the tradeoff between energy harvesting and packet transmission to obtain the maximum total achievable throughput. To be specific, we first formulate the throughput maximization problems as non-linear optimization problems, and then prove them as convex problems by monotonicity analysis. Moreover, we obtain the closed-form optimal solution in the energy cooperation mode. We prove the existence of the optimal solution in the joint cooperation mode, obtain the upper and lower bounds, and provide numerical analysis for the optimal solution. Finally, we highlight the benefits of information cooperation and the impact of multi-user gain on the maximum of the total achievable throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08874991.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2946813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2946813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total Throughput Maximization of Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks With Energy Harvesting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Energy harvesting","Relays","Sensors","Transmitters","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","energy harvesting","optimisation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy cooperation mode","joint cooperation mode","primary signals","information cooperation","cooperative cognitive radio networks","energy harvesting cognitive radio networks","secondary users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","energy harvesting","total achievable throughput","cooperative mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Total Throughput Maximization of Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks With Energy Harvesting","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8874991/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19262641","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61902353, 61902351, 61432015 and 61872322"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total Throughput Maximization of Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks With Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2946813-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126321S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8874991","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8874993,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyuan Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8874993/fu-2946797-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyuan Fu received the B.S. degree from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2014.

However, IoT networks will be ultra-dense with the explosive growth of IoT devices. Network function virtualization (NFV) emerges to provide flexible network frameworks and efficient resource management for the performance of IoT networks. In NFV-enabled IoT infrastructure, service function chain (SFC) is an ordered combination of virtual network functions (VNFs) that are related to each other based on the logic of IoT applications. However, the embedding process of SFC to IoT networks is becoming a big challenge due to the dynamic nature of IoT networks and the abundance of IoT terminals. In this paper, we decompose the complex VNFs into smaller virtual network function components (VNFCs) to make more effective decisions since VNF nodes and IoT network devices are usually heterogeneous. In addition, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme with experience replay and target network is proposed as a solution that can efficiently handle complex and dynamic SFC embedding scenarios in IoT. Our simulations consider different types of IoT network topologies. The simulation results present the efficiency of the proposed dynamic SFC embedding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2946797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08874993.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2946797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Service Function Chain Embedding for NFV-Enabled IoT: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Service Function Chain Embedding for NFV-Enabled IoT: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874993/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19262624","htmlLink":"/document/8874993/","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771068, 61671079 and 61471063"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4182041"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Service Function Chain Embedding for NFV-Enabled IoT: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"twc-yu-2946797-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140356S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8874993","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8874994,"authors":[{"name":"Ata Khalili","affiliation":["Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8874994/khali-2946832-small.gif","p":["Ata Khalili (S\u201918) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (Hons.) in electrical engineering from Shahed University, in 2016 and 2018, respectively.

We study the problem under two practical scenarios. In the first scenario, known as conventional antenna selection (CAS), there is only one radio frequency (RF) chain available at the mobile user and all the sub-channels for each user can be assigned to one of the antennas. For the second scenario, known as generalized antenna selection (GAS), the number of RF chains is equal to the number of antennas and the messages of each user can transmit over its assigned sub-channels via different antennas. The resource allocation design is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) and then converted into a single objective optimization problem (SOOP) via the weighted Tchebycheff method. The considered problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) which is generally intractable. To address this problem, a penalty function is introduced to handle the binary variable constraints. In order to obtain a computationally efficient suboptimal solution, the majorization minimization (MM) approach is proposed where a surrogate function serves as the lower bound of the objective function. Furthermore, we propose another low-complexity practical algorithm to further reduce the computational cost. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and unveil an interesting trade-off between EE and SE for two considered scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2946832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2946832","startPage":"595","endPage":"609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08874994.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection Strategy for Energy Efficiency Maximization in Uplink OFDMA Networks: A Multi-Objective Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection Strategy for Energy Efficiency Maximization in Uplink OFDMA Networks: A Multi-Objective Approach","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19262635","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8874994/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UNSW Digital Grid Futures Institute, UNSW, Sydney"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP190101363"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection Strategy for Energy Efficiency Maximization in Uplink OFDMA Networks: A Multi-Objective Approach","sourcePdf":"twc-rasti-2946832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166579S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8874994","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8874998,"authors":[{"name":"Elaheh Sadeghabadi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran","Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8874998/sadeg-2946824-small.gif","p":["Elaheh Sadeghabadi received the B.S and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2015 and 2017, respectively.

In initial studies of M-MIMO, the system has been considered to be perfectly synchronized throughout the entire cells. However, perfect synchronization may be hard to attain in practice. Therefore, we study a M-MIMO system whose cells are not synchronous to each other, while transmissions in a cell are still synchronous. We analyze an asynchronous downlink M-MIMO system in terms of the coverage probability and the ergodic rate by means of the stochastic geometry tool. For comparison, we also obtain results for the corresponding synchronous system. In addition, we investigate the effect of the uplink power control and the number of pilot symbols on the downlink ergodic rate, and we observe that there is an optimal value for the number of pilot symbols maximizing the downlink ergodic rate of a cell. Our results also indicate that, compared to the synchronous system, the downlink ergodic rate is more sensitive to the uplink power control in the asynchronous mode.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2946824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08874998.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2946824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Downlink Massive MIMO Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8874998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8874998/","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Downlink Massive MIMO Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19262649","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8874998/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002398","fundingName":"Sharif University of Technology","grantNumber":"QB960605"},{"fundingName":"VR Research Link Grant, Sweden"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Downlink Massive MIMO Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach","sourcePdf":"twc-azimiabarghouyi-2946824-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13089S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8874998","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8874999,"authors":[{"name":"Li Gao","affiliation":["University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8959427/8874999/gao-2944820-small.gif","p":["Li Gao (GS\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

First, a dynamic event-triggered strategy is proposed based on a quantized output feedback, for which a quantized output feedback controller is formed. Second, theoretical criteria are derived to ensure the bounded synchronization of master-slave neural networks. With these criteria, an explicit upper bound is given for the synchronization error. Sufficient conditions are also provided on the existence of quantized output feedback controllers. A Chua's circuit is chosen to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. Third, a secure communication scheme is presented based on the synchronization of master-slave neural networks by combining the basic principle of cryptology. Then, a secure image communication is studied to verify the feasibility and security performance of the proposed secure communication scheme. The impact of the quantization level and the event-triggered control (ETC) on image decryption is investigated through experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2943548","startPage":"3334","endPage":"3345","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/9184294/08875000.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2943548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9184294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communication Based on Quantized Synchronization of Chaotic Neural Networks Under an Event-Triggered Strategy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Chaotic communication","Quantization (signal)","Output feedback","Biological neural networks","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","cryptography","image processing","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantized output feedback controller","bounded synchronization","master-slave neural networks","synchronization error","secure communication scheme","secure image communication","security performance","quantization level","event-triggered control","quantized synchronization","chaotic neural networks","dynamic event-triggered strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaotic neural networks","event-triggered strategy","quantized synchronization","secure communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communication Based on Quantized Synchronization of Chaotic Neural Networks Under an Event-Triggered Strategy","volume":"31","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8875000/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2020","accessionNumber":"19909973","pubMedId":"31634849","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major Program of the Science and Technology Ministry in China","grantNumber":"2018AAA0101600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61922030 and 61773163"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST","grantNumber":"2016QNRC001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","grantNumber":"17ZR1444600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013105","fundingName":"Shanghai Rising-Star Program","grantNumber":"18QA1401400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"222201917006 and 50321081916019"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of the Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"B17017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council through the Discovery Project Scheme","grantNumber":"DP170103305"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communication Based on Quantized Synchronization of Chaotic Neural Networks Under an Event-Triggered Strategy","sourcePdf":"tnnls-he-2943548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112414S","chronDate":"Sept.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"9184294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"9184294","articleId":"8875000","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":8875002,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Fan Chou","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation (CITI), Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8875002/chou-2946822-small.gif","p":["Shih-Fan Chou received the double B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Management Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2009, the M.S. degree from the Institute of Network Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2017.

Being agile and resilient, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mounting small cells are deemed emerging platforms for the provision of wireless services. As the residual battery capacity available to UAVs determines the lifetime of an airborne network, it is essential to account for the energy expenditure on various flying actions in a flight plan. The focus of this paper is therefore on studying the 3D deployment problem for a swarm of UAVs, with the goal of maximizing the total amount of data transmitted by UAVs. In particular, we address an interesting trade-off among flight altitude, energy expense and travel time. We formulate the problem as a non-convex non-linear optimization problem and propose an energy-aware 3D deployment algorithm to resolve it with the aid of Lagrangian dual relaxation, interior-point and subgradient projection methods. Afterwards, we prove the optimality of a special case derived from the convexification transformation. We then conduct a series of simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm. Simulation results manifest that our proposed algorithm can benefit from the proper treatment of the trade-off.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2946822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08875002.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2946822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware 3D Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Deployment for Network Throughput Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware 3D Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Deployment for Network Throughput Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8875002/","accessionNumber":"19262648","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"108-2221-E-002-069-MY3, 107-2923-E-002-006-MY3 and 106-2221-E-002-MY2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006477","fundingName":"National Taiwan University","grantNumber":"108L880503"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004725","fundingName":"Ministry of Economic Affairs","grantNumber":"107-EC-17-A-02-S5-007"},{"fundingName":"MOXA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006112","fundingName":"Microsoft Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"107-2218-E-390-003-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware 3D Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Deployment for Network Throughput Optimization","sourcePdf":"twc-pang-2946822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138985S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8875002","onlineDate":"17 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8875021,"authors":[{"name":"Omair Rafique","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, TU Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Omair","lastName":"Rafique","id":"37085784005"},{"name":"Florian Krebs","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, TU Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Krebs","id":"37085504634"},{"name":"Klaus Schneider","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, TU Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37272771500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875021","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875021","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Computational modeling","Hardware","Computer architecture","C++ languages","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow computing","formal specification","multi-threading","parallel languages","parallelising compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RVC-CAL dataflow language","RVC-CAL language","dataflow process networks","parallel software","RVC-CAL models","parallelism","data-parallel execution","open computing language","OpenCL","fine-grained execution","multithreading","task-parallel execution","coarse-grained execution","RVC-CAL DPN","efficient parallel code generation","multithreaded C++ approach","SYCL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dataflow programming languages, parallel code generation, performance acceleration"]}],"abstract":"The RVC-CAL language is used for implementing dataflow process networks (DPNs), i.e., distributed systems of actors. The behavior of an actor is defined by a set of actions which can consume input tokens and produce output tokens. RVC-CAL DPNs can offer parallelism both at the level of actors and at the level of actions. To efficiently execute these models on a target hardware, it is important to generate parallel code based on the entire parallelism provided by these two levels. In this paper, we discuss criteria for the generation of parallel software from RVC-CAL models based on the potential parallelism of modeled behaviors. The approach considers both the coarse-grained (task-parallel) execution of actors using multithreading and the fine-grained (data-parallel) execution of their actions using the open computing language (OpenCL) or even a higher-level layer of OpenCL, namely SYCL. The methodology is validated by benchmarks on OpenCL abstracted hardware platforms. Based on the experimental results, the methodology is evaluated for efficiency (performance) in comparison with a pure multithreaded C++ approach and a well-known reference framework.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00035","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875021.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating Efficient Parallel Code from the RVC-CAL Dataflow Language","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Generating Efficient Parallel Code from the RVC-CAL Dataflow Language","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875021/","accessionNumber":"19080107","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating Efficient Parallel Code from the RVC-CAL Dataflow Language","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061572S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8875030,"authors":[{"name":"Bahareh Khabbazan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering School, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Bahareh","lastName":"Khabbazan","id":"37087051676"},{"name":"Sattar Mirzakuchaki","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering School, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sattar","lastName":"Mirzakuchaki","id":"37293972900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875030","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":733},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Low-Power, Embedded CNN Accelerator on a Low-end FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875030.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"650","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00102","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Convolution","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","System-on-chip","Quantization (signal)","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","low-power electronics","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks","embedded vision systems","low-end hardware platform","Z-turn evaluation board","Xilinx Zynq-7000 system","power consumption","low area consumption","embedded CNN accelerator","low-end FPGA","Xilinx Zynq-7000 system on chip","Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC","power 1.77 W","memory size 601.0 KByte"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks, FPGA, low-end hardware platform, Soc, Zynq, Low power"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875030","abstract":"In this paper, an optimized hardware for Convolutional Neural Networks with the purpose of implementation on embedded vision systems is presented.

Also, the accelerator has a frequency of 160 MHz and power consumption of 1.77 watts which leads to a performance of 40.96GOP/s, using only 134 computing units and 601 KB of internal memory. So we can claim that the acceptable speed and low power and low area consumption of this architecture make it an ideal choice for portable and embedded CNN applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080140","htmlLink":"/document/8875030/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Low-Power, Embedded CNN Accelerator on a Low-end FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Low-Power, Embedded CNN Accelerator on a Low-end FPGA","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069002S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8875040,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Corda","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Corda","id":"37086499977"},{"name":"Gagandeep Singh","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Gagandeep","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086497418"},{"name":"Ahsan Jawed Awan","affiliation":["Ericsson Research"],"firstName":"Ahsan Jawed","lastName":"Awan","id":"37087046087"},{"name":"Roel Jordans","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Jordans","id":"38542604000"},{"name":"Henk Corporaal","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Corporaal","id":"37266918700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875040","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"abstract":"Near-memory Computing (NMC) promises improved performance for the applications that can exploit the features of emerging memory technologies such as 3D-stacked memory.

In this paper, we evaluate and extend a number representation based on power-of-two quantization enabling bit-shift-based processing of multiplications. We found that weights of a neural network can either be represented by a single 4 bit power-of-two value or with two 4 bit values depending on accuracy requirements. We evaluate the classification accuracy of VGG-16 and ResNet50 on the ImageNet dataset with weights represented in our novel number format. To include a more complex task, we additionally evaluate the format on two networks for semantic segmentation. In addition, we design a novel processing element based on bit-shifts which is configurable in terms of throughput (4 bit mode) and accuracy (8 bit mode). We evaluate this processing element in an FPGA implementation of a dedicated accelerator for neural networks incorporating a 32-by-64 processing array running at 250 MHz with 1 TOp/s peak throughput in 8 bit mode. The accelerator is capable of processing regular convolutional layers and dilated convolutions in combination with pooling and upsampling. For a semantic segmentation network with 108.5 GOp/frame, our FPGA implementation achieves a throughput of 7.0 FPS in the 8 bit accurate mode and upto 11.2 FPS in the 4 bit mode corresponding to 760.1 GOp/s and 1,218 GOp/s effective throughput, respectively. Finally, we compare the novel design to classical multiplier-based approaches in terms of FPGA utilization and power consumption. Our novel multiply-accumulate engines designed for the optimized number representation uses 9 % less logical elements while allowing double throughput compared to a classical implementation. Moreover, a measurement shows 25 % reduction of power consumption at same throughput. Therefore, our flexible design offers a solution to the trade-off between energy efficiency, accuracy, and high throughput.","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875046.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00106","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Shift-Based Accelerator for CNNs with Selectable Accuracy and Throughput","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Shift-Based Accelerator for CNNs with Selectable Accuracy and Throughput","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875046/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875046/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080149","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Shift-Based Accelerator for CNNs with Selectable Accuracy and Throughput","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079839S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8875056,"authors":[{"name":"Fin Hendrik Bahnsen","affiliation":["Institute of Embedded Systems, Hamburg University of Technology, 21073 Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Fin Hendrik","lastName":"Bahnsen","id":"37087045269"},{"name":"Goerschwin Fey","affiliation":["Institute of Embedded Systems, Hamburg University of Technology, 21073 Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Goerschwin","lastName":"Fey","id":"37265818100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875056","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875056","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","embedded systems","failure analysis","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local monitoring","embedded applications","artificial neural networks","distributed networks","network participants","service availability","system integrity","short-term memory recurrent neural networks","fault model","IoT devices","reliability","Internet of Things","abnormal system behavior identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monitoring","Neural Networks","Deep Learning","Long Short Term Memory","Internet of Things","System of Systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00076","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875056.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","startPage":"485","endPage":"491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Monitoring of Embedded Applications and Devices using Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"Reliability, security, and safety become even more challenging in times of the Internet of Things (IoT).

We propose a monitor concept based on long short-term memory recurrent neural networks which adapts to new devices by learning the nominal behavior automatically.

Many binarized neural networks are recently proposed to address these issues. Although they have significantly decreased computation and memory footprint, they have suffered from accuracy loss especially for large datasets. In this paper, we propose TOT-Net, a ternarized neural network with [-1, 0, 1] values for both weights and activation functions that has simultaneously achieved a higher level of accuracy and less computational load. In fact, first, TOT-Net introduces a simple bitwise logic for convolution computations to reduce the cost of multiply operations. To improve the accuracy, selecting proper activation function and learning rate are influential, but also difficult. As the second contribution, we propose a novel piece-wise activation function, and optimized learning rate for different datasets. Our findings first reveal that 0.01 is a preferable learning rate for the studied datasets. Third, by using an evolutionary optimization approach, we found novel piece-wise activation functions customized for TOT-Net. According to the experimental results, TOT-Net achieves 2.15%, 8.77%, and 5.7/5.52% better accuracy compared to XNOR-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet top-5/top-1 datasets, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875067.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TOT-Net: An Endeavor Toward Optimizing Ternary Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Quantization (signal)","Memory management","Convolutional neural networks","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ternary neural networks","high computation demands","big memory resources","convolutional neural networks","binarized neural networks","learning rate optimization","piece-wise activation functions","TOT-Net achieves","piece-wise activation function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural networks, ternary neural network, activation function, optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"TOT-Net: An Endeavor Toward Optimizing Ternary Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875067/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080111","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TOT-Net: An Endeavor Toward Optimizing Ternary Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097814S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875101,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37087047818"},{"name":"Wladimir Valenzuela","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Wladimir","lastName":"Valenzuela","id":"37086338308"},{"name":"Miguel Figueroa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Figueroa","id":"38482957200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875101","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Kernel","Neurons","Streaming media","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","edge detection","field programmable gate arrays","integrated memory circuits","iterative methods","memory architecture","pipeline processing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video data","memory architecture","line buffers","on-chip memory utilization","Xilinx XC7A200T FPGA","single CeNN iteration","CeNN algorithm","hardware accelerator","high-definition video","cellular neural network","real-time edge detection","fully-pipelined processing elements","data parallelism","visible-range video","power 618.0 mW","frequency 245.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware acceleration","cellular neural network","edge detection","Field-Programmable Gate Array"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875101","abstract":"This paper presents the architecture of a hardware accelerator for a cellular neural network (CeNN) with an application to real-time edge detection on visible-range and infrared video.

The methodology is developed considering the quality, efficiency and productivity required in an industrial verification setup. The flow proposes a systematic approach addressing various aspects of the formal verification. First, the design implementation (RTL) is analyzed for its formal friendliness based on several predefined criteria. Next, a property automation flow is adapted for an efficient property development. Later, a series of verification tasks, grouped into formal test plan and formal execution plan are carried out to reach the formal sign-off stage. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the methodology, the proposed flow has been successfully applied on several industrial designs. In this paper, we consider the formal verification of Error Correction Codes, generally implemented in program and data flash memory interfaces to benchmark the proposed flow.

In image recognition, in general, large numbers of labeled sets containing image and correct value pairs to be identified are input to a neural network, and repeatedly learning the set enables the neural network to identify objects with high accuracy. A new side-channel attack method, deep learning side-channel attack (DLSCA), utilizes the high identifying ability of the neural network to try and unveil a secret key of the cryptographic module by being trained with power waveforms and learning the leak model. However, at this stage, attacks on software implementations have been mainly investigated. In contrast, there are few studies about hardware implementations especially such as ASIC circuits. In this paper, we investigate the use of DL-SCA against hardware implementations of AES and demonstrate that it is able to unveil the secret key by applying a new technique named \"mixed model dataset based on round-round XORed value.\" We also compare the attack performance and characteristics of DL-SCA with conventional analysis methods such as correlation power analysis and conventional template attack.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00046","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875151.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Side-Channel Attack Against Hardware Implementations of AES","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875151/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Side-Channel Attack Against Hardware Implementations of AES","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080132","htmlLink":"/document/8875151/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Side-Channel Attack Against Hardware Implementations of AES","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079913S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875164,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Mousavi","affiliation":["Technical University of Eindhoven"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Mousavi","id":"37545090800"},{"name":"Sayandip De","affiliation":["Technical University of Eindhoven"],"firstName":"Sayandip","lastName":"De","id":"37086497657"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Pourshaghaghi","affiliation":["Technical University of Eindhoven"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Pourshaghaghi","id":"37399659300"},{"name":"Henk Corporaal","affiliation":["Technical University of Eindhoven"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Corporaal","id":"37266918700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875164","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875164","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Single event upsets","Redundancy","Estimation","Fault tolerant systems","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","radiation hardening (electronics)","redundancy","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ZedBoard","Triple Modular Redundancy","SEU","CM vulnerability","single event upsets","configuration memory","FT adder FPGA design","intrinsic error tolerant applications","FT techniques","SRAM-based FPGAs","FPGA designs","Static Random-Access Memory-based Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","Fault Tolerant FPGAs","word length 32 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Tolerance","FPGA","Single Event Upset","Approximate Computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00103","endPage":"654","startPage":"651","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875164.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Tolerant FPGAs: Where to Spend the Effort?","abstract":"Static Random-Access Memory-based (SRAM-based) Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in real-life applications, such as autonomous driving, high tech systems, and in space, where high dependability is a mandatory requirement. Since FPGA designs are stored in the Configuration Memory (CM) in SRAM-based FPGAs, they are very sensitive to Single Event Upsets (SEUs). Thus, adapting FPGA designs to make them more Fault Tolerant (FT) is extremely important. FT techniques introduce additional penalties in system parameters, like area, power consumption and performance. In order to tradeoff between the overhead introduced by FT techniques and system robustness, an accurate estimation of CM vulnerability to SEUs is needed. Many intrinsic error tolerant applications can tolerate in-exact output values to some degree. This paper shows how to exploit this property in making much cheaper FT FPGA designs with less overhead. For instance, our method can remove 51% of the area overhead for less than 0.048% output degradation, when considering a 32-bit FT adder FPGA design by applying Triple Modular Redundancy. We verify our results on various FPGA designs using a ZedBoard.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875164/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875164/","accessionNumber":"19080139","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault Tolerant FPGAs: Where to Spend the Effort?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Tolerant FPGAs: Where to Spend the Effort?","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066226S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8875174,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Can Mert","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet Can","lastName":"Mert","id":"37085820960"},{"name":"Hasan Azgin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Azgin","id":"37085381869"},{"name":"Ercan Kalali","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ercan","lastName":"Kalali","id":"38492182100"},{"name":"Ilker Hamzaoglu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilker","lastName":"Hamzaoglu","id":"37295957400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875174","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Adders","Power demand","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware design languages","Motion estimation","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","logic design","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exact hardware designs","absolute difference operation","approximate AD hardware implementations","approximate adders","approximate AD hardware designs","approximate absolute difference hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absolute difference","motion estimation","approximate computing","hardware design","low power"]}],"abstract":"Approximate hardware designs have higher performance, smaller area or lower power consumption than exact hardware designs at the expense of lower accuracy.

In space applications it is necessary, therefore, to monitor the SEU rate in order to ensure timely detection of high radiation levels and efficient protection of radiation-sensitive circuits. This work proposes an approach combining the SEU monitoring and data storage functions in the same on-chip Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) module, with negligible cost and overheads compared to traditional stand-alone SEU monitors. Furthermore, it also enables the detection of permanent faults in SRAM. The proposed monitor is intended to be further integrated into a highly dependable and self-adaptive multiprocessing platform in which it will drive the selection of the multiprocessor operating modes. Thus, a dynamic trade-off between reliability, performance and power consumption in real-time can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00080","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875178.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Design of SRAM-Based Low-Cost SEU Monitor for Self-Adaptive Multiprocessing Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080178","htmlLink":"/document/8875178/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of SRAM-Based Low-Cost SEU Monitor for Self-Adaptive Multiprocessing Systems","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059072S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8875183,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Azgin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Azgin","id":"37085381869"},{"name":"Ercan Kalali","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ercan","lastName":"Kalali","id":"38492182100"},{"name":"Ilker Hamzaoglu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilker","lastName":"Hamzaoglu","id":"37295957400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875183","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Adders","Prediction algorithms","Video coding","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","data compression","field programmable gate arrays","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intra angular prediction equation","VVC intra prediction","FPGA implementation","international video compression standard","Video Coding intra prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VVC","intra prediction","hardware implementation","FPGA","DSP Block"]}],"abstract":"Versatile Video Coding (VVC) is a new international video compression standard offering much better compression efficiency than previous video compression standards at the expense of much higher computational complexity.

In order to meet the performance demands of these dense designs, designers introduced an efficient communication paradigm, Network-on-Chip (NoC), instead of traditional wiring-based methods. Although mesh topology is most commonly used topology for NoC design, it has several problems such as network congestion and energy consumption. Reconfigurable mesh topology is a good alternative to traditional mesh since it gives more mapping and routing options for reducing network congestion. However, design automation tools still lack efficient mapping and routing algorithms for reconfigurable meshes. In this study, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based method that simultaneously maps the application nodes on 2D reconfigurable mesh structure and determines the routing paths between communicating pairs with the objective of energy minimization.

This paper demonstrates simpler speech features derived in the time-domain for Keyword Spotting (KWS). The features are considered as constrained lag autocorrelations computed on overlapped speech frames to form a 2D map. We refer to this as Multi-Frame Shifted Time Similarity (MFSTS). MFSTS performance is compared against the widely known Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) that are computed in the frequency-domain. A Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to classify keywords using both MFCC and MFSTS. This is done by employing an open source dataset from Google Brain, containing ~ 106000 files of one-second recorded words such as, 'Backward', 'Forward', 'Stop' etc. Initial findings show that MFSTS can be used for KWS tasks without visiting the frequency-domain. Our experimental results show that classification of the whole dataset (25 classes) based on MFCC and MFSTS are in a very good agreement. We compare the performance of the TCNbased classifier with other related work in the literature. The classification is performed using small memory footprint (~ 90 KB) and low compute power (~ 5 MOPs) per inference. The achieved classification accuracies are 93.4% using MFCC and 91.2% using MFSTS. Furthermore, a case study is provided for a single-keyword spotting task. The case study demonstrates how MFSTS can be used as a simple preprocessing scheme with small classifiers while achieving as high as 98% accuracy. The compute simplicity of MFSTS makes it attractive for low power KWS applications paving the way for resource-aware solutions.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00053","startPage":"313","endPage":"319","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875204.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Keyword Spotting using Time-Domain Features in a Temporal Convolutional Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Correlation","Feature extraction","Speech recognition","Task analysis","Time-domain analysis","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","feature extraction","speech processing","speech recognition","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mel-frequency cepstral coefficients","MFCC","frequency-domain","temporal convolutional network","single-keyword spotting task","voice recognition services","speech features","overlapped speech frames","multiframe shifted time similarity","MFSTS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Speech Recognition, Keyword Spotting (KWS), MFCC, Autocorrelation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Keyword Spotting using Time-Domain Features in a Temporal Convolutional Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875204/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080151","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keyword Spotting using Time-Domain Features in a Temporal Convolutional Network","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117298S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8875205,"authors":[{"name":"Sergiu Nimara","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Nimara","id":"37085486885"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875205","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875205","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Logic gates","Delays","Bit error rate","Circuit faults","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","decoding","delays","error statistics","logic gates","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability assessment","flooded Min-Sum LDPC decoders","sub-threshold processing units","hierarchical decomposition","combinational sub-blocks","sequential sub-blocks","logic synthesis","logic gate","delay-dependent fault model","noncritical paths","sub-threshold gates","error-correction performance","faulty flooded Min-Sum LDPC decoder architectures","Binary Additive White Gaussian Noise","BiAWGN communication channel model","bit error rate metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward error correction, LDPC, simulated fault injection, sub-threshold circuits, reliability assessment"]}],"abstract":"This paper aims to evaluate the performance degradation of faulty flooded Min-Sum LDPC decoder architectures based on sub-threshold processing units, by performing hierarchical decomposition of combinational and sequential sub-blocks of processing units described at RTL level.

These applications have division as one of the fundamental operations. Division is also one of the costliest operations in terms of energy consumption. Thus, various works have been done to address the issue of energy consumption in multimedia applications by using approximate dividers based on pass transistor logic (PTL). Since these applications have resilience towards erroneous computations huge energy benefits are obtained as a result of approximate computations with similar output quality. In this paper, we have shown that PTL based designs are not suitable for lower technology nodes. We performed an in-depth analysis using UMC 65nm and UMC 28nm to highlight the adverse effects of technology scaling on energy consumption and delay in PTL based design as compared to CMOS based designs. We also propose four different inexact CMOS subtractor (ICS) designs, as they are the basic repeated module in inexact restoring array dividers (IRADs). Our proposed ICS designs consume ~ 2\u00d7 lesser dynamic energy, ~ 3\u00d7 lesser static power and have ~ 2.5\u00d7 lesser delay as compared to the existing PTL based designs in UMC 65nm. These benefits increase for UMC 28nm, which shows PTL based designs further worsens at lower technology nodes. IRADs also give about 50% reduction in energy consumption with only 3% degradation in Structural Similarity (SSIM) Index, an image quality metric in multimedia applications like change detection, background removal, and JPEG compression, as compared to exact restoring array divider (ERAD).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875219/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875219/","accessionNumber":"19080172","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of Novel CMOS Based Inexact Subtractors and Dividers for Approximate Computing: An In-Depth Comparison with PTL Based Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Novel CMOS Based Inexact Subtractors and Dividers for Approximate Computing: An In-Depth Comparison with PTL Based Designs","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078414S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8875230,"authors":[{"name":"Oana Boncalo","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Oana","lastName":"Boncalo","id":"37396354200"},{"name":"Alexandru Amaricai","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Amaricai","id":"37396351700"},{"name":"Zsofia Lendek","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Zsofia","lastName":"Lendek","id":"37545397300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2862-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2863-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875230","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulators","Hardware","Registers","Takagi-Sugeno model","Process control","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configurable hardware accelerator architecture","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller","parametric hardware accelerator","application specific weighting function computation block","generic control output computation unit","programmable register file based interface","hardware design methodology","freedom robot arm controller","hardware TS fuzzy controller","FPGA implementation","maximum working frequencies","two degree of freedom robot arm controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control, robot arm control, FPGA acceleration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875230","abstract":"In this paper, we present a parametric hardware accelerator for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers.

Finally, we compare their performances and their hardware cost to select at the end the adequate architecture and conclude about spike-based neural networks as a potential solution for embedded artificial intelligence applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Coding and Hardware Architecture of Spiking Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2019.00050","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 22nd Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867828/8875008/08875242.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2019.00050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875008","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Information Coding and Hardware Architecture of Spiking Neural Networks","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875242/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080194","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Coding and Hardware Architecture of Spiking Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kallithea, Greece","sourcePdf":"286200a291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078336S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867828","isNumber":"8875008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867828","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8875008","articleId":"8875242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875262,"authors":[{"name":"Haitao Guo","affiliation":["Dept. of Multimedia Engineering, Dongguk University-Seoul, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Guo","id":"37087053490"},{"name":"Yunsick Sung","affiliation":["Dept. of Multimedia Engineering, Dongguk University-Seoul, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Yunsick","lastName":"Sung","id":"37085703293"},{"name":"Jungho Kang","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Security, Baewha Women\u2019s University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jungho","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086866007"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875262","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Internet of Things","Green computing","Social computing","Handheld computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","motion estimation","position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rich interactive information","human motion estimation","UAV control","deep learning methods","human arm motion","deep learning networks","forearms","motion estimation approach","unmanned aerial vehicles","UAV","control technology","key interaction technology","human body language","HTC Vive","bidirectional two-layer LSTM fusion network","Euclidean distance similarity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HTC Vive","deep learning","UAV control","motion estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875262","abstract":"With the widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there is an increasing demand for the development of their control technology. The key interaction technology between humans and UAVs needs to focus on the human body language, which comprises rich interactive information, as it is the most natural, intuitive, and easy to master approach of interpersonal communication for humans. Therefore, the research on human motion estimation for UAV control is of considerable practical significance. Recently, deep learning has made breakthroughs in speech, image recognition and, other fields, and has crushed the performance of traditional methods in many fields. However, in the field of human motion estimation, deep learning has been progressing slowly. To overcome the limitations of the traditional methods and explore the application of deep learning methods in the field of motion estimation, this study proposes a method to estimate human arm motion using deep learning networks. We proposed a bidirectional two-layer LSTM fusion network to estimate the forearms' motion according to the hand position measured by HTC Vive. The performance was verified using a real data set. The average Euclidean distance similarity can reach up to 56%. In comparison with the traditional methods, the proposed method demonstrated wider applicability and better performance.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00083","startPage":"381","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875262.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Estimation Approach for UAV Controls Using Bidirectional Two-Layer LSTMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875262/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Motion Estimation Approach for UAV Controls Using Bidirectional Two-Layer LSTMs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875262/","accessionNumber":"19080275","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Estimation Approach for UAV Controls Using Bidirectional Two-Layer LSTMs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062469S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8875270,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In addition, since the GRU uses a simpler architecture than the LSTM, it has a simpler hardware implementation and fewer arithmetic components compared to the LSTM-based models.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00202","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gated Recurrent Neural Networks Empirical Utilization for Time Series Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gated Recurrent Neural Networks Empirical Utilization for Time Series Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875282/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080336","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gated Recurrent Neural Networks Empirical Utilization for Time Series Classification","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000b207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059405S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875283,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Liu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085444285"},{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenieria Telematica, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Reviriego","id":"37393409900"},{"name":"Kazuteru Namba","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuteru","lastName":"Namba","id":"37323293400"},{"name":"Salvatore Pontarelli","affiliation":["National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Pontarelli","id":"37273892100"},{"name":"Livi Xiao","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Livi","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37087054530"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2261-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1550-5774"}],"articleNumber":"8875283","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875283","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Decoding","Parity check codes","Encoding","Redundancy","Complexity theory","Phase change materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction","error correction codes","Gray codes","memristors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gray coding","64 data bits memories","Multilevel Cell memories","MLC memories","magnitude-2 levels","64 data bit memory","4-bit cells","symbol-based codes","low redundancy double error correction Spotty codes","4-bit multilevel cells"]}],"abstract":"Non-volatile emerging Multilevel Cell (MLC) memories (such as magneto electric, magnetic resistive, memristor-based and phase change memories) are attractive to increase density. A key advantage of these memories is that they can store several bits per cell by using different levels. This however reduces the margins against noise and other effects and can lead to larger error rates. Errors in MLC memories are usually limited to magnitude-2 levels, and thus corrupt one or two bits per cell when using a Gray mapping from levels to bits. This enables the use of codes that can correct those error patterns in a memory cell instead of codes that correct all possible patterns in the cell, thus reducing complexity and cost. In this paper, the case of a 64 data bit memory built using memory cells that can store four bits and suffer up to double bit errors per cell is considered. Several (72, 64) Spotty codes that can correct double bit errors in 4-bit cells are designed and evaluated. The new codes require fewer parity bits than existing Spotty codes or symbol-based codes such as Hong-Patel codes. Therefore, they reduce the size of the memory while having encoding and decoding complexity similar to existing alternative codes.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875283","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875283.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Redundancy Double Error Correction Spotty Codes Combined with Gray Coding for 64 Data Bits Memories of 4-bit Multilevel Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low Redundancy Double Error Correction Spotty Codes Combined with Gray Coding for 64 Data Bits Memories of 4-bit Multilevel Cells","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079058","htmlLink":"/document/8875283/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Redundancy Double Error Correction Spotty Codes Combined with Gray Coding for 64 Data Bits Memories of 4-bit Multilevel Cells","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"DFTS_2019_paper_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072631S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863044","isNumber":"8875268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863044","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875268","articleId":"8875283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8875291,"authors":[{"name":"Farah Kandah","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Farah","lastName":"Kandah","id":"37395417900"},{"name":"Joseph Cancelleri","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Cancelleri","id":"37087048281"},{"name":"Donald Reising","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Reising","id":"37547133700"},{"name":"Amani Altarawneh","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Amani","lastName":"Altarawneh","id":"37086799659"},{"name":"Anthony Skjellum","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Skjellum","id":"37347707700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875291","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blockchain","Transmitters","Support vector machines","Wireless communication","Communication system security","Trust management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","cryptocurrencies","cryptographic protocols","cyber-physical systems","data privacy","hardware-software codesign","Internet","Internet of Things","quality of service","smart cities","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software codesign approach","communication technologies","smart cities","operational efficiency","citizen welfare","authentication","blockchain protocols","RF-DNA","enhanced device identity","system trustworthiness","entity trust","IoT-CPS","Internet of Things","quality of services","communication reliability","multitier methodology","trust-building","distribution framework","radio frequency-distinct native attributes","Byzantine actor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","IoT","RF-DNA Fingerprinting","Trust management"]}],"abstract":"Advancement in communication technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving adoption in smart cities that aims to increase operational efficiency and improve the quality of services and citizen welfare, among other potential benefits.

Our threat model accounts for counterfeiting, breakout fraud, and bad mouthing of one entity by others. Entity trust (e.g., IoT devices) depends on quality and level of participation, quality of messages, lifetime of a given entity in the system, and the number of known \"bad\" (non-consensus) messages sent by that entity. Based on this approach to trust, we are able to adjust trust upward and downward as a function of real-time and past behavior, providing other participants with a trust value upon which to judge information from and interactions with the given entity. This approach thereby reduces the potential for manipulation of an IoT system by a bad or byzantine actor.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00191","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875291.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00191","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","startPage":"1125","endPage":"1134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hardware-Software Codesign Approach to Identity, Trust, and Resilience for IoT/CPS at Scale","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Hardware-Software Codesign Approach to Identity, Trust, and Resilience for IoT/CPS at Scale","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875291/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875291/","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080267","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hardware-Software Codesign Approach to Identity, Trust, and Resilience for IoT/CPS at Scale","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000b125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103717S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8875302,"authors":[{"name":"Jiachi Wang","affiliation":["Software College, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jiachi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087051643"},{"name":"Hang Li","affiliation":["Software College, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Li","id":"37600684000"},{"name":"Shoulin Yin","affiliation":["Software College, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Shoulin","lastName":"Yin","id":"37086849824"},{"name":"Yang Sun","affiliation":["Software College, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085899286"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875302","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Improved Pedestrian Detection Algorithm Based on Convolutional Neural Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875302.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00063","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Object detection","Hidden Markov models","Detection algorithms","Convolutional neural networks","Deep learning","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","feature extraction","image classification","object detection","pedestrians"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pedestrian detection algorithm","detection object","detection effect","regional proposal network","fast RCNN","pedestrian detector","object detection network","convolutional neural network framework","classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","Pedestrian detection","Feature extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875302","abstract":"As we all know, The feature obtained by the convolutional neural network (CNN) is the expression of higher level for the input image, which can improve the discrimination of the input data.

In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are gaining popularity and are evaluated for deployment in safety critical applications such as self driving vehicles. Modern CNNs feature enormous memory bandwidth and high computational needs, challenging existing hardware platforms to meet throughput, latency and power requirements. Functional safety and error tolerance need to be considered as additional requirement in safety critical systems. In general, fault tolerant operation can be achieved by adding redundancy to the system, which is further exacerbating the computational demands. Furthermore, the question arises whether pruning and quantization methods for performance scaling turn out to be counterproductive with regards to fail safety requirements. In this work we present a methodology to evaluate the impact of permanent faults affecting Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) and how to effectively decrease their effects in hardware accelerators. We use FPGA-based hardware accelerated error injection, in order to enable the fast evaluation. A detailed analysis is presented showing that QNNs containing convolutional layers are by far not as robust to faults as commonly believed and can lead to accuracy drops of up to 10%. To circumvent that, we propose two different methods to increase their robustness: 1) selective channel replication which adds significantly less redundancy than used by the common triple modular redundancy and 2) a fault-aware scheduling of processing elements for folded implementations.","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875314.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875314","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Error-Tolerant Quantized Neural Network Accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Error-Tolerant Quantized Neural Network Accelerators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875314/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875314/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079072","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Error-Tolerant Quantized Neural Network Accelerators","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"DFTS_2019_paper_23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064081S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863044","isNumber":"8875268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863044","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8875268","articleId":"8875314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8875316,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Gao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085474484"},{"name":"Jinhua Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jinhua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086590082"},{"name":"Lina Yan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086584360"},{"name":"Tong Yan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Yan","id":"37087054406"},{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Telem\u00e1tica, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Reviriego","id":"37393409900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2261-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1550-5774"}],"articleNumber":"8875316","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","5G mobile communication","Three-dimensional displays","6G mobile communication","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication","field programmable gate arrays","filters","integrated circuit reliability","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyphase-filter based decimators","SRAM-FPGAs","digital communication systems","Poly Phase Filters","Single Event Upsets","PPF based decimators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decimation","Polyphase filters","Reliability","Single Event Upsets","FPGAs"]}],"abstract":"Decimation is widely used in digital communication systems to reduce the oversampling rate of the base band signal. The structure of Poly Phase Filters (PPFs) provides an efficient implementation of the decimator. This paper studies the effects of Single Event Upsets (SEUs) on PPFs based decimators implemented on SRAM-FPGAs. Fault injection experiments are performed to evaluate the reliability of the decimator to SEUs on filter coefficients and on the configuration memory. For the first part, experiment results show that only SEUs on the two most significant bits would cause non negligible SNR loss in the output. For SEUs on the essential bits in the configuration memory, about 20% of them would affect the results, among which 70% of the SEUs would cause negligible SNR loss. The percentage of SEUs that cause a SNR loss larger than 5dB are 7%, 13% and 16% for decimation rates of 16, 8 and 4, respectively. This can be explained as the decimator is composed of a number of parallel filters that is equal to the decimation rate, and each filter contributes a fraction of the final output. Therefore, a SEU on one filter would not cause large degradation to the decimated signal, and the larger the decimation rate is, the smaller the degradation of decimated signal introduced by the SEU.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875316","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875316.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Evaluation of Polyphase-filter based Decimators Implemented on SRAM-FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875316/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Evaluation of Polyphase-filter based Decimators Implemented on SRAM-FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875316/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079057","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Evaluation of Polyphase-filter based Decimators Implemented on SRAM-FPGAs","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"DFTS_2019_paper_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05963S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863044","isNumber":"8875268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863044","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875268","articleId":"8875316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8875320,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Lasheras","affiliation":["Departament d'Arquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Lasheras","id":"37087045448"},{"name":"Ramon Canal","affiliation":["Departament d'Arquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Canal","id":"37391750000"},{"name":"Eva Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Departament d'Arquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Rodr\u00edguez","id":"37270918100"},{"name":"Luca Cassano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Cassano","id":"37887699400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2261-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1550-5774"}],"articleNumber":"8875320","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Encryption","Hardware","Proposals","Power demand","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic circuit protection","RSA hardware accelerator protection","RSA circuit algorithm","fault tolerance attacks","DFA","HW implementations","cryptographic algorithms","differential fault analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attack Resistance","Cryptographic Hardware Accelerators","Differential Fault Analysis","Hardware Security"]}],"abstract":"Hardware accelerators for cryptographic algorithms are ubiquitously deployed in nowadays consumer and industrial products. Unfortunately, the HW implementations of such algorithms often suffer from vulnerabilities that expose systems to a number of attacks, among which differential fault analysis (DFA). It is therefore crucial to protect cryptographic circuits against such attacks in a cost-effective and power-efficient way. In this paper, we propose a lightweight technique for protecting circuits implementing the RSA algorithm against DFA. The proposed solution borrows residue checking from the traditional fault tolerance and applies it to RSA circuits in order to first detect the occurrence a fault and then to react to the attack by obfuscating the output values. An experimental campaign demonstrated that the proposed solution detects the 100% of the possible fault attacks while leading to a 2.85% area overhead, a 16.67% power consumption increase and with no operating frequency decrease.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875320","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875320.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protecting RSA Hardware Accelerators against Differential Fault Analysis through Residue Checking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Protecting RSA Hardware Accelerators against Differential Fault Analysis through Residue Checking","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875320/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079069","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875320/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protecting RSA Hardware Accelerators against Differential Fault Analysis through Residue Checking","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"DFTS_2019_paper_26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090652S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863044","isNumber":"8875268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863044","xplore-issue":"8875268","articleId":"8875320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875328,"authors":[{"name":"Donald Kline","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Kline","id":"37085401552"},{"name":"Stephen Longofono","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Longofono","id":"37087050084"},{"name":"Rami Melhem","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Melhem","id":"37273234900"},{"name":"Alex K.

In this work, we provide the first demonstration of the existence of a small number of weak cells to single event effects for DDR3 memory when exposed to radiation. Thus, a high proportion of single event faults are actually not entirely random and can be predicted with high accuracy. We also demonstrate a classification of single event effects into predictable single cell, unpredictable single cell, and correlated multi-cell persistent faults, the latter due to latch-up effects. We further show that through classification, we can partition faults, which allows the development of a holistic framework to provide enhanced protection of the DRAM memory. This framework leverages a fault map with bit sparing to protect against faults from weak cells in conjunction with Chipkill ECC to effectively correct chip-level and random errors. This protection provides a potential path to the use of commodity DRAM memory in high radiation environments with extremely low fault rates.

Experimental results show that our model improves the prediction accuracy of CPU utilization and changes frequency scaling effect of traditional DVFS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875348/","accessionNumber":"19080307","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875348/","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Improved Dynamic Frequency Scaling Approach for Energy Saving Based RBF Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Dynamic Frequency Scaling Approach for Energy Saving Based RBF Neural Network","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083353S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8875349,"authors":[{"name":"Haobo Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Haobo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37087047329"},{"name":"Zongyang Xiong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zongyang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37087050950"},{"name":"Jiexin Zhang","affiliation":["The Third Research Institute Of The Ministry Of Public Security, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiexin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087050324"},{"name":"Ke Qin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Qin","id":"37398256500"},{"name":"Guoming Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guoming","lastName":"Lu","id":"37067632400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875349","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Internet of Things","Green computing","Social computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","natural language processing","vectors","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chinese words representation learning","Chinese characters","fine-grained semantic meanings","word representations","fine-grained feature vectors","word vector","word similarity","Chinese word analogy dataset","fine-grained features","cascade morphological n-gram","Chinese word embedding learning","Chinese word representation models","CBC n-gram model","Stroke based cascade n-gram","SBC n-gram models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chinese word embedding, Word morphology, N-gram, Word Stroke, Word Component"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875349","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875349.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascade Morphological n-Gram Can Improve Chinese Words Representation Learning","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of learning Chinese word embeddings. Chinese characters are composed of components, and components can be further divided into strokes. While fine-grained semantic meanings in components and strokes of words are often ignored. We propose Component based cascade n-gram(CBC n-gram) models and Stroke based cascade n-gram(SBC n-gram) models to improve word representations by capturing morphological information at different granularity levels. We keep a distinct vector for each word, and the average of fine-grained feature vectors is coupled with the word vector for enriching the word representations. We evaluate our word representations on word similarity, word analogy using datasets wordsim-240, wordsim-296, Chinese word analogy dataset respectively. The results prove the effects of these two kinds of fine-grained features on word representations. Comparisons with recently state-of-the-art Chinese word representation models demonstrate the superior performances of our models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875349/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080286","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cascade Morphological n-Gram Can Improve Chinese Words Representation Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascade Morphological n-Gram Can Improve Chinese Words Representation Learning","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05612S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8875350,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Xiong","affiliation":["School of Big Data and Intelligent Engineering, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37087054600"},{"name":"Yong Cao","affiliation":["School of Big Data and Intelligent Engineering, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37654213100"},{"name":"Fei Dai","affiliation":["School of Big Data and Intelligent Engineering, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37534803800"},{"name":"Yucheng Li","affiliation":["School of Big Data and Intelligent Engineering, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yucheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37087049658"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875350","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Genetic algorithms","Kalman filters","Mathematical model","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Global Positioning System","inertial navigation","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","radial basis function networks","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard Kalman filtering","extended Kalman filtering","RBF neural network","quantum genetic algorithm","Kalman filtering gains","navigation precision","combined navigation system","Signal to Noise ratio","strapdown inertial navigation system/Global positioning system","anti-interference property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum genetic algorithm","RBF neural network","SINS/GPS combined navigation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875350","abstract":"The combined navigation of Strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/Global positioning system (GPS) has been widely applied in various fields currently. Meanwhile, the standard Kalman filtering and the extended Kalman filtering are the widely applied algorithms in the navigation system. However, those algorithms need to be further improved in processing nonlinear signals and uncertain disturbance. Because of the precision of the combined navigation is far from perfect and has a weak robustness. The combined navigation method of RBF neural network based on the quantum genetic algorithm is put forward in this paper. The parameters of RBF neural network are adjusted and optimized using the quantum genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, the Kalman filtering gains are also adjusted through neural network to increase the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR). Thus, the navigation precision and the anti-interference property get improved. In the simulation test about the combined navigation system of SINS/GPS, test results show that the algorithm could realize a better precision and robustness. In addition, the validity of the algorithm is also verified in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00111","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875350.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"563","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Navigation Method of RBF Neural Network Based on Quantum Genetic Algorithm in Edge Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Combined Navigation Method of RBF Neural Network Based on Quantum Genetic Algorithm in Edge Devices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19080298","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875350/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Navigation Method of RBF Neural Network Based on Quantum Genetic Algorithm in Edge Devices","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056865S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8875353,"authors":[{"name":"Yuze Zou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yuze","lastName":"Zou","id":"37086042570"},{"name":"Shaohan Feng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shaohan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086139858"},{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","id":"37296968900"},{"name":"Yutao Jiao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yutao","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37086140668"},{"name":"Shimin Gong","affiliation":["School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Shimin","lastName":"Gong","id":"37530343000"},{"name":"Wenqing Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong Univ. of Science & Technology, China"],"firstName":"Wenqing","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37280063900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875353","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":648},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Training","Games","Machine learning","Computational modeling","Data models","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","evolutionary computation","game theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["powerful mobile devices","distributed data","data privacy","federated learning system","computation resources","machine learning applications","evolutionary game mode","mobile device training strategies","evolutionary game approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Federated Learning, Evolutionary Game, Equilibrium"]}],"abstract":"With the tremendous success of machine learning and increasingly powerful mobile devices, federated learning has gained growing attention from both academia and industry.

Instead of storing enormous raw data, SI attempts to annotate these data with semantic information (a.k.a. ontology) that can enable smart management of the ever-increasing data generated by IoT. One of the main features of ontology is semantic reasoning for deriving implicit knowledge from explicit context information. Nevertheless, such semantic reasoning in the cloud can be computationally expensive with the gigantic amount of incoming data. In this research, we propose the adoption of \"Fog Computing\" to distribute the procedure of semantic reasoning among a hierarchy of distributed Fog nodes than in a centralized cloud. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we compare the proposed distributed Fog architecture with a centralized Cloud system based on the use case of elderly care.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019

topics around machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have (re-)gained a lot of interest due to high demand in industrial automation applications in various areas such as medical, automotive and space and the increasing computational power offered by technology advancements. One common task for these applications is object recognition/classification whose input is usually an image taken from camera and output is whether an object is present and the class of the object. In industrial pipeline, this task could be used to identify possible defects in products; in automotive application, such task could be deployed to detect pedestrians for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). When the task is safety-critical as in automotive application, the reliability of the task implementation is crucial and has to be evaluated before final deployment. On the other hand, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices are gaining increasing attention in the hardware acceleration part for machine learning applications due to their high flexibility and increasing computational power. When the SRAM-based FPGA is considered, Single Event Upset (SEU) in configuration memory induced by radiation particle is one of the major concerns even at sea level. In this paper, we present the fault injection results on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation on Xilinx SRAM-based FPGA which demonstrate that though there exists built-in redundancy in CNN implementation one SEU in configuration memory can still impact the task execution results while the possibility of Single Event Multiple Upsets (SEMU) must also be taken into consideration.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875362","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems

In order to provide high quality recommendation services, privacy of user is often obtained by untrusted recommendation systems. At the same time, malicious attacks often use the recommendation results to try to guess the private data of user. This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm based on NMF and random perturbation technology, which implements the recommendation system and solves the protection problem of user privacy data in the recommendation process on cloud computing. Compared with the privacy protection algorithm of SVD, the elements of the matrix after the decomposition of the new algorithm are non-negative elements, avoiding the meaninglessness of negative numbers in the matrix formed by texts, images, etc., and it has a good explanation for the local characteristics of things. Experiments show that the new algorithm can produce recommendation results with certain accuracy under the premise of protecting users' personal privacy on cloud computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080255","htmlLink":"/document/8875364/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"NMF-Based Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Filtering on Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NMF-Based Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Filtering on Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075551S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875367,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Xu","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087050623"},{"name":"Qingmin Meng","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qingmin","lastName":"Meng","id":"37087050419"},{"name":"Lizhen Deng","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lizhen","lastName":"Deng","id":"37086122828"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875367","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875367","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Gesture recognition","Data mining","Image color analysis","Training","Convolution","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","gesture recognition","image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic gesture recognition method","rotation angle","human-computer interaction","inter-frame difference method","gesture key frame","Hue Saturation Value color space model","gestures positioning","final gesture frame","final process","convolutional neural network model","gesture models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["human computer interaction","gesture recognition","skin segmentation","inter frame difference","convolutional ceural networks"]}],"abstract":"A method for identifying dynamic gestures is studied for the problem of low recognition accuracy under the rotation angle in gesture recognition of human-computer interaction.

The motivation of the proposed method is that in the hyperspectral images, the spectral curve of each pixel can be viewed as a function, mathematically. And it can make the best of the abundant spectral information of the original hyperspectral images. Based on this, we have proposed an effective hyperspectral image classification method which mainly used functional principal component analysis (FPCA) before. However, FPCA method focuses on the global features analysis of hyperspectral image data and may not well extract local structural features. In this paper, in order to better reflect the local structural features of hyperspectral images, we make use of the time-frequency localization characteristics of wavelet transformation to decompose hyperspectral images. Then, the sparse wavelet decomposition coefficients are classified by using extreme learning machine (ELM). Experimental results on two popular hyperspectral images show that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art hyperspectral image classification methods.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00087","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875369.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","startPage":"403","endPage":"409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Transformation of Functional Data for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Transformation of Functional Data for Hyperspectral Image Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875369/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080284","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875369/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Transformation of Functional Data for Hyperspectral Image Classification","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133017S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875373,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Song","affiliation":["North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Song","id":"37400225000"},{"name":"Jinkun Han","affiliation":["North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinkun","lastName":"Han","id":"37087046021"},{"name":"Junwei Xie","affiliation":["North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junwei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37087054779"},{"name":"Yanning Gao","affiliation":["North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanning","lastName":"Gao","id":"37087047382"},{"name":"Liangliang Song","affiliation":["ThingPark China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liangliang","lastName":"Song","id":"37087045925"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875373","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875373","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Logic gates","Forecasting","Clouds","Monitoring","Zigbee","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerosols","air pollution","air quality","atmospheric composition","data communication","environmental science computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Forecasting PM2.5 Concentration Levels","long short-term memory","air pollution","PM2.5 prediction model","short-term memory cyclic neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoT","LoRa","LSTM","Deep Learning","PM2.5"]}],"doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00151","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875373.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","startPage":"834","endPage":"841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System for Detecting and Forecasting PM2.5 Concentration Levels Using Long Short-Term Memory and LoRa","abstract":"Atmospheric particulate matter, such as PM2.5, contributes to air pollution negatively affecting human health. Many factors determine the change of PM2.5 concentration levels, which can be very sudden, nonlinear, and uncertain. Hence, traditional methods are not always suitable for predicting the exact amount of PM2.5 in the air. Effective forecasting of PM2.5 levels can tell people the air condition and support country's sustainable development; hence, forecasting PM2.5 values has an important social and long-term economic significance. This study proposes a system for monitoring the amount of PM2.5 and other pollutants in the air using the long-range wireless data communication technology LoRa and a cloud-based system model, which includes a proprietary terminal device. LoRa's excellent characteristics, such as low-power consumption and long range, allow effectively obtaining a history of PM2.5 readings. A PM2.5 prediction model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) cyclic neural network is utilized to predict the next few hours' PM2.5 values and carry out an air quality index analysis of PM2.5. Experiments using atmospheric pollutant datasets collected specifically for this study from the North China University of Technology in 2019 show that the system can analyze well the PM2.5 datasets and accurately predict the hourly variation trend of PM2.5.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875373/","accessionNumber":"19080332","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875373/","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"System for Detecting and Forecasting PM2.5 Concentration Levels Using Long Short-Term Memory and LoRa","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System for Detecting and Forecasting PM2.5 Concentration Levels Using Long Short-Term Memory and LoRa","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a834.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058121S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":8875376,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Xu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085377176"},{"name":"Bowei Tang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Bowei","lastName":"Tang","id":"37087052105"},{"name":"Gaoxing Jiang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Gaoxing","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37087045594"},{"name":"Xihua Liu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xihua","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087047518"},{"name":"Yuan Xue","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37087011784"},{"name":"Yuan Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086549399"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875376","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Entropy","Privacy","Data communication","Data privacy","Mobile handsets","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","evolutionary computation","mobile computing","Pareto optimisation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile devices","edge computing","computing power","privacy-aware data offloading method","service provisioning","mobile cloud","mobile subscribers","private user data","identity information","property security","personal security","privacy leakage","strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm","privacy entropy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["privacy preservation","edge computing","data offloading","privacy entropy","transmission time"]}],"abstract":"To fulfill peoples requirements for low latency and strong computing power in mobile devices, edge computing emerges as a paradigm for realizing service provisioning in the edge of mobile cloud near the activity area of the mobile subscribers. Despite numerous advantages of edge computing, there is still a risk of leaking private user data, including identity information, address, etc., during the process of data offloading from mobile devices to edge nodes, which threatens personal and property security potentially. Therefore, it is of great importance of prohibiting privacy leakage for data offloading in edge computing. In repose to this requirement, a privacy-aware data offloading method (PDO) in edge computing is proposed in this paper. Technically, the privacy of the data offloading in edge computing is analyzed in a formalized way. Then, an improved of strength pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) is employed to realize joint optimization of the average time of transmission and the privacy entropy. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted to verify reliability and efficiency of PDO.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00049","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875376.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Aware Data Offloading for Mobile Devices in Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Aware Data Offloading for Mobile Devices in Edge Computing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19080201","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875376/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Aware Data Offloading for Mobile Devices in Edge Computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074115S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875377,"authors":[{"name":"Junhao Zhou","affiliation":["Macau SAR, Macau University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Junhao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086618582"},{"name":"Hong-Ning Dai","affiliation":["Macau SAR, Macau University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Hong-Ning","lastName":"Dai","id":"37291911200"},{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Gj\u00f8vik, Norway"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085798359"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875377","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Standards","Computational modeling","Intelligent transportation systems","Benchmark testing","Training","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","image classification","intelligent transportation systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic sign recognition","intelligent transportation systems","convolutional neural networks","traffic-sign classification","mobile devices","portable devices","portable convolutional neural network structure","portable CNN model","stacked convolutional structure","portable convolution neural networks","compression modules","factorization modules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks","Portable","Factorization","Model Compression","Intelligent Transportation Systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00032","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875377.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portable Convolution Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition in Intelligent Transportation Systems","abstract":"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have the strength in traffic-sign classification in terms of high accuracy.

However, the ECG data to be classified is not only enormous in amount, but also complex in structure. Therefore, solutions are needed to deal with such huge and diverse datasets. In this paper, the authors develop a novel ECG classification scheme using deep learning in wearable health monitoring system. The proposed method first compresses and reconstructs the ECG signals based on compressive sensing, and then develops a deep learning approach to perform heartbeat classification over the recovered ECG signals. Simulation experiments have shown that the proposed scheme can achieve classification accuracy of up to 97.06% with low energy consumption in sensor node as compared to benchmarking methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing

Modern GPU chips are designed to deliver extreme performance for graphics and for data-parallel general purpose computing workloads (GPGPU computing) as well. Many GPGPU applications require high reliability, thus reliability evaluation has become a crucial step during their design. State-of-the-art techniques to assess the reliability of a system are fault injection and ACE analysis. The former can produce accurate results despite eternal time while the latter is very fast but it lacks accuracy of the results. In this paper we introduce a new sampling methodology based on cluster sampling that enables the exploitation of ACE analysis to accelerate the fault injection process. In our experiments we demonstrate that state-of-the-art fault injection techniques, generating random faults according to a uniform distribution, is outperformed by the proposed sampling technique, thus enabling several advantages in terms of accuracy and evaluation time. To quantify the introduced benefits we analyzed the micro-architecture reliability of an AMD Southern Islands GPU in presence of single bit upset affecting the vector register file for 6 benchmarks. One of the most important achievements is that considering all the benchmarks, on average, we are one order of magnitude faster/more accurate than uniform-sampling-based techniques in case of non exhaustive fault injection campaigns, while more than two orders of magnitude in case of exhaustive campaigns.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875392","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance

wireless communication, the amount of data produced by mobile devices is increasing rapidly. The mobile devices can hardly handle these data immediately as they have limitations on their computing power. In edge computing, the computing tasks can be offloaded from the mobile devices to nearby edge nodes (ENs) for implementing. Combined with 5G networks, the computing tasks can be offloaded to the central units (CUs), enhanced into ENs, or the cloud infrastructure via distributed units (DUs) for processing. In this way, the above phenomenon will be effectively released. However, how to select the appropriate ENs for executing, aiming to keep a balance between the load balance and the energy consumption, is still a big problem waiting to be solved. In this paper, an optimization problem is formulated to improve the load balance and reduce the energy consumption of all the ENs for edge computing-enabled 5G networks while considering the privacy conflicts and time consumption. Then, an energy-efficient computation offloading method with privacy preservation, named ECOP, is proposed. Finally, experimental results and evaluations confirm our proposed method is feasible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875401/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19080280","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875401/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Computation Offloading with Privacy Preservation for Edge Computing-Enabled 5G Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Computation Offloading with Privacy Preservation for Edge Computing-Enabled 5G Networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071984S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8875403,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxin Sun","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yuxin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37087046591"},{"name":"Xianzhang Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xianzhang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085567515"},{"name":"Duo Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402813400"},{"name":"Yujuan Tan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yujuan","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086951573"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875403","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Virtual machining","Cloud computing","Task analysis","Power demand","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","mobile computing","power aware computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["required active MEC servers","power consumption","power-aware virtual machine placement","MEC layer","edge devices","edge layer","virtual machines","mobile edge computing","power-efficient jobs placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Edge Computing, jobs placement, virtual machine, power-efficient"]}],"abstract":"The Mobile Edge Computing provides an attractive platform to bring data processing closer to its source in a networked environment.

The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the power consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Aware Virtual Machine Placement for Mobile Edge Computing","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00117","startPage":"595","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875403.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Power-Aware Virtual Machine Placement for Mobile Edge Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875403/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080370","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Aware Virtual Machine Placement for Mobile Edge Computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073818S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875406,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Peng","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Academic Engineering Research Centre in Industrial Intellectual Techniques and Systems, Quanzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086344360"},{"name":"Maosheng Zhu","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Maosheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37087053169"},{"name":"Yiwen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yiwen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087051316"},{"name":"Lingxia Liu","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Lingxia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087054820"},{"name":"Victor C.M.

It will be a kind of flexible research method to realize the flood prediction of small and medium-sized rivers through intelligent models such as neural network. The area of small and medium-sized river basins is relatively small. Precipitation, soil moisture, evaporation and other factors can affect the timely total runoff prediction. However, not all the hydrological features is always valuable for flood forecasting, even at some time, noise of the factors will have larger interference on forecast process. Therefore, dynamic extraction of key feature vectors from various hydrological information plays an important role in flood forecasting. This paper proposed a flood forecasting model (STA-LSTM model) by using long short-term memory model (LSTM) and attention mechanism. We take the Lech river basin in Europe as the experimental basin and the results show that STA-LSTM performs well and has high research value with comparison of support vector machine (SVM), fully

development and research in the field of communication technologies have congested the unlicensed spectrum. It has resulted in uncontrolled and unrestricted interference to the low-powered wireless sensor network based Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, these advancements have necessitated the low-powered IoT to be designed with limited cost, low-energy consumption and efficient spectrum utilization. The issue of spectrum utilization is solved by cognitive radio (CR) network, a low-cost solution to utilize the spectrum efficiently. In CR networks the underutilized licensed spectrum is exploited by unlicensed users opportunistically. Due to their opportunistic nature, the performance of these networks depends on the observed spectrum pattern of a primary user. Therefore, perfect modeling of the spectrum detection and utilization is required in these networks. In this paper, we propose a primary user detection model for Cognitive Radio based Internet of Things (CR-IoT) using the hidden Markov model. We introduced two algorithms; one for free channel detection using the concept of HMM, and the second for efficient allocation of free detected channels. The simulation results show that CR-IoT outperformed traditional networking schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19080244","htmlLink":"/document/8875419/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation for Real Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Resource Allocation for Real Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Internet of Things","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000b143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056134S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8875427,"authors":[{"name":"Chunyan Ji","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Chunyan","lastName":"Ji","id":"37087054782"},{"name":"Xueli Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Xueli","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37087046921"},{"name":"Sunitha Basodi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Sunitha","lastName":"Basodi","id":"37086325800"},{"name":"Yi Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Pan","id":"37275624000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875427","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pediatrics","Deep learning","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Asphyxia","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","injuries","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","medical signal processing","neural nets","paediatrics","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["merged feature matrix","deep learning approach","weighted prosodic features","asphyxiated baby crying classification","asphyxiated infant cry classification","infant mortality rate","acoustic features","respiratory injury","artificially intelligent technology","neural networks","Baby Chillanto Database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asphyxia","Weighted Prosodic Features","Deep Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875427","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875427.pdf","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Asphyxiated Infant Cry Classification Based on Acoustic Features and Weighted Prosodic Features","abstract":"Asphyxia is a respiratory injury that leads to a serious damage for infants.

The weights of the prosodic features are trained at the frame level with labeled data and can be optimized using deep learning approach with neural networks. The novel merged feature matrix is established with both acoustic and weighted prosodic features.

However, the learning process of the existing federated learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner, e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return, the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices and that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg equilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method. Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00148","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","startPage":"815","endPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Service Pricing and Cooperative Relay Communication for Federated Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Service Pricing and Cooperative Relay Communication for Federated Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875430/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080299","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Service Pricing and Cooperative Relay Communication for Federated Learning","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093925S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875431,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Mousavi","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Mousavi","id":"37545090800"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Pourshaghaghi","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Pourshaghaghi","id":"37399659300"},{"name":"Henk Corporaal","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Corporaal","id":"37266918700"},{"name":"Akash Kumar","affiliation":["Dresden University of Technology"],"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292250700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2261-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1550-5774"}],"articleNumber":"8875431","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scatter Scrubbing: A Method to Reduce SEU Repair Time in FPGA Configuration Memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875431","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Redundancy","Single event upsets","Maintenance engineering","Indexes","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM","Single Event Upsets","FPGA Configuration Memory","mean time to repair","MTTR","scatter scrubbing","FPGA circuit","optimal partition","accelerated brute-force method","FPGA designs","SEU repair time","SEU sensitive bits","CM bits","FPGA CM","nonpolynomial complexity","read-back scrubbing techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","fault tolerance","SEU","scrubbing","configuration memory"]}],"abstract":"SRAM-based FPGAs are widely used in many critical systems in which dependability is an essential factor. However, SRAM-based FPGAs are sensitive to Single Event Upsets (SEUs), especially when they are used in space. Scrubbing is an effective technique to protect FPGA Configuration Memory (CM) against SEUs. One major hurdle in read-back scrubbing techniques is that they suffer from long Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). In this paper, we propose scatter scrubbing, a new method that reduces MTTR by exploiting the locality of SEUs sensitive bits in CM. It is based on 1) splitting FPGA CM into several partitions based on how critical the CM bits are for proper operation of the FPGA circuit, and 2) deriving a smart schedule for scrubbing the partitions. Finding an optimal partition and scheduling has non-polynomial complexity; therefore we rely on clever heuristics, especially for the first step. However, for small designs, we developed an accelerated brute-force method giving the optimal solution, which we can use as a reference. The experimental results show, for real FPGA designs, up to 64% reduction in MTTR compared to state-of-the-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875431","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875431.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Scatter Scrubbing: A Method to Reduce SEU Repair Time in FPGA Configuration Memory","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079074","htmlLink":"/document/8875431/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scatter Scrubbing: A Method to Reduce SEU Repair Time in FPGA Configuration Memory","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"DFTS_2019_paper_22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060481S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863044","isNumber":"8875268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863044","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8875268","articleId":"8875431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875437,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Rabay'a","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Rabay'a","id":"37087237287"},{"name":"Eduard Schleicher","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Schleicher","id":"37087236167"},{"name":"Kalman Graffi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany"],"firstName":"Kalman","lastName":"Graffi","id":"37545396500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875437","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Edge computing","Cloud computing","Internet of Things","Computational modeling","Bandwidth","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet of Things","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT devices","cloud computing","fog layer","fog nodes","fog computing models","existing fog computing architectures","fog computing bandwidth","Internet-of-Things devices","computation tasks","peer-to-peer fog model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing, Fog computing, Internet-of-Things, Peer-to-peer, Bandwidth, Simulation"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is an architecture which several Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices relay on to outsource their computation tasks. The numbers and needs of IoT devices have grown massively, to which cloud computing could not fulfill these needs. Cloud computing has its shortcomings in terms of bandwidth, latency, and real-time response. To overcome these shortcomings fog computing paradigm was introduced, which can fulfill requests from IoT devices and forward requests to the cloud if necessary. However, there are still requests that need to go to the cloud and might suffer from its shortcomings. Our proposed peer-to-peer (p2p) fog model enhances fog computing by adding p2p mechanism into the fog layer, which allow the fog nodes to collaborate in order to meet the clients needs. This way we minimize the requests that go to the cloud and fulfill most of the requests by the fog nodes at the proximity of the user. In this research, we evaluate the proposed p2p fog model, under the use case of file sharing application, and show that it has better outcomes in term of bandwidth throughput compared to cloud computing and fog computing models. Therefore we have simulated cloud computing, fog computing, and p2p fog computing scenarios, then compared and evaluated their outcome results. Further research into fog computing could build upon this proposed model and extend existing fog computing architectures.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00036","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875437.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fog Computing with P2P: Enhancing Fog Computing Bandwidth for IoT Scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875437/","displayDocTitle":"Fog Computing with P2P: Enhancing Fog Computing Bandwidth for IoT Scenarios","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080291","htmlLink":"/document/8875437/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fog Computing with P2P: Enhancing Fog Computing Bandwidth for IoT Scenarios","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077834S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875444,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Cao","affiliation":["School of Big Data and Intelligent Engineering, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37654213100"},{"name":"Youjie Zhao","affiliation":["School of Big Data and Intelligent Engineering, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Youjie","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37087045733"},{"name":"Fei Dai","affiliation":["School of Big Data and Intelligent Engineering, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37087054537"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875444","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Genetic algorithms","Edge computing","Sensors","Big Data","Energy consumption","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","simulated annealing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high energy consumption","localization method","WSNN","quantum annealing algorithm","quantum tunneling effect","node localization","wireless sensor networks","edge computing","distributed computing paradigm","distributed device nodes","genetic algorithm","wireless sensor network nodes","low localization accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor network (WSN), node localization, quantum annealing (QA) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), classical simulated annealing (SA)"]}],"abstract":"Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm in which computation is largely or completely performed on distributed device nodes.

However, they both have many problems, including 1) easy to fall into local optimum, difficult to achieve global optimum and low localization accuracy; 2) complicated calculation and high energy consumption, etc. In this study, a localization method for WSNN based on quantum annealing (QA) algorithm was proposed by using quantum tunneling effect, in which the energy barrier can be quickly penetrated from local optimum to global optimum, so that the calculation is simplified and the computation speed is increased. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm improves the precision and reduces the energy consumption compared with the traditional GA and the classical SA algorithm, making it have wider application prospects.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00112","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875444.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Quantum Annealing Algorithm and Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875444/","displayDocTitle":"Node Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Quantum Annealing Algorithm and Edge Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875444/","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080274","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Quantum Annealing Algorithm and Edge Computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076321S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875466,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejiang Wei","affiliation":["School of Logistics, State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering (Wuhan University), Wuhan Technology and Business University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xuejiang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37087049512"},{"name":"Libing Wu","affiliation":["Computer School, State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering (Wuhan University), Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Libing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402839400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875466","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"Sensor cloud is a cloud platform for Internet of Things (IoT) that addresses the challenges of virtualization, multi-tenant, and dynamic provisioning encountered by the IoT industry today.

energy. Photovoltaic arrays are a widely employed systems used to harvest solar energy. In such systems, the presence of faulty cells negatively affect the energy production of the entire array. The design of fault tolerant solar arrays is therefore attracting a growing interest. In this work, we propose a hardware implementation of a fault-recovery algorithm for solar cell arrays. The proposed system detects cells with degraded performance using a memristor as sensing device. With the aim of improving energy production efficiency, the connections among solar cells are reconfigured according to the array health status. The designed system automatically activates spare cells in the segments of the array to eventually increase energy production. The proposed solution can be adapted to arrays of any size and be applied to different types of solar cells. We show through simulations that the solution here proposed significantly increases the energy production in presence of faults.","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875467.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Tolerant Photovoltaic Array: A Repair Circuit Based on Memristor Sensing","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Fault Tolerant Photovoltaic Array: A Repair Circuit Based on Memristor Sensing","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079071","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875467/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Tolerant Photovoltaic Array: A Repair Circuit Based on Memristor Sensing","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"DFTS_2019_paper_52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058847S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863044","isNumber":"8875268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863044","xplore-issue":"8875268","articleId":"8875467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875468,"authors":[{"name":"Nikos Foutris","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Foutris","id":"37991585500"},{"name":"Christos Kotselidis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Kotselidis","id":"37392849400"},{"name":"Mikel Luj\u00e1n","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Mikel","lastName":"Luj\u00e1n","id":"37392848800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2261-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1550-5774"}],"articleNumber":"8875468","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875468","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Multicore processing","Degradation","Temperature measurement","Reliability engineering","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","failure analysis","integrated circuit reliability","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","silicon","wear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable wear-out rate","asymmetric multicores","high performance computing domains","continuous-operation reliability assessment","asymmetric configuration","architecture level","silicon industry","deep nanoscale technologies","operational stress","inefficient power dissipation","unsustainable thermal thresholds","wear-induced failures","performance degradation","device breakdown","increasing susceptibility","wear-out leads","mean time to failure","processor components","reliability boundaries","experimental analysis","aged hardware resource","MTTF-aware asymmetric configuration","wear-out effects simulation"]}],"abstract":"As the silicon industry moves into deep nanoscale technologies, preserving Mean Time to Failure at acceptable levels becomes a first-order challenge. The operational stress, along with the inefficient power dissipation and the unsustainable thermal thresholds increase the wear-induced failures. As a result, faster wear-out leads to earlier performance degradation with eventual device breakdown. Furthermore, the proliferation of asymmetric multicores is tightly coupled with an increasing susceptibility to variable wear-out rate within the components of processors. This paper investigates the reliability boundaries of asymmetric multicores, which span from embedded systems to high performance computing domains, by performing a continuous-operation reliability assessment. As our experimental analysis illustrates, the variation between the least and the most aged hardware resource equals to 2.6 years. Motivated by this finding, we show that an MTTF-aware, asymmetric configuration prolongs its lifetime by 21%.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875468","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875468","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875468.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulating Wear-out Effects of Asymmetric Multicores at the Architecture Level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulating Wear-out Effects of Asymmetric Multicores at the Architecture Level","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079066","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875468/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulating Wear-out Effects of Asymmetric Multicores at the Architecture Level","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"DFTS_2019_paper_64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08934S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863044","isNumber":"8875268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863044","xplore-issue":"8875268","articleId":"8875468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8875471,"authors":[{"name":"Heekyung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Heekyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086003379"},{"name":"Ken Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Choi","id":"37402857200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2980-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875471","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Power demand","Object detection","Convolutional neural networks","Computational modeling","Acceleration","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","convolutional neural nets","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","logic design","object detection","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized FPGA design","CPU","virtual memories","customized YOLOv2","half precision convolution","pipeline-based architecture","accelerated hardware design","design technique","low power system","power efficient BCNN-based object detection acceleration","power efficient design","binary convolutional neural network","small IoT devices","power consumption","FPGA accelerator","Xilinx FPGA-SoC design","virtual memory system","binary precision convolution","target device","Xilinx ZYNQ-SoC based PYNQ Z-1 board","power 1.45 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low Power","Power Efficient","High performance","Convolutional Neural Network","Accelerator","FPGA SoC Design","PYNQ Overlay","Real-time Object Detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00060","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875471.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Implementation of a Power Efficient BCNN-Based Object Detection Acceleration on a Xilinx FPGA-SoC","abstract":"This paper focuses on the power efficient design on the FPGA SoC for the object detection system based on Binary Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN).

In our proposed FPGA-SoC design, it supports not only FPGA but also CPU and the peripheral component can be supported by additional virtual memory system for reducing the processing time. Overall customization including customized BCNN, virtual memories for CPU and FPGA part allows our testbed to achieve low power consumption without speed degradation. Our testbed is based on customized YOLOv2 which consists of applied binary and half precision convolution, and pipeline-based architecture with accelerated hardware design on the target device. The target device used in this paper is the Xilinx ZYNQ-SoC based PYNQ Z-1 board. Our proposed system achieves 15.15 frames per second (FPS) and 1.45 watts of power dissipation.

The most important high throughput and low latency can be guaranteed by 5G. Centralized vehicle control and vehicular network programmability are provided by software defined networks (SDN). Vehicular network security is always critical because it is directly related to personal safety and traffic efficiency. However, security issues of 5G-SDVN are complicated and challenging due to the rapid mobility of vehicles and complex network topology. Also, the scalability and programmability of SDN can enlarge the attack surface, leading to more defects and vulnerabilities. Hence, a dynamic security defense service is urgently needed. In this paper, a software defined dynamic security defense (SD-DSD) scheme is proposed to provide security-as-service for 5G-SDVN. The proposed scheme firstly conducts a security assessment to evaluate the security level of current system. Based on the security assessment result, the proposed scheme then dynamically generates and deploys security strategies in an software defined way. In consequence, the proposed scheme can improve the security level of a given 5G-SDVN system. The evaluation demonstrated that the proposed scheme can improve the system security level effectively and efficiently with a high network performance.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00158","startPage":"880","endPage":"887","publicationTitle":"2019

Four neural networks (NNs) are proposed for computational experiments on electricity consumption forecasting. The NNs considered are back propagation neural network (BPNN), fully recurrent neural network (fRNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The four models are implemented using PyTorch, an open-source ML framework. By comparing their predictive performance, we find that LSTM and GRU attain lower errors than the other two models. More precisely, GRU presents better performance for the daily forecast whereas LSTM outperforms the rest for the monthly forecast. Insights about PyTorch are also provided, as it represents a recent addition to state of the art technologies, in terms of implementation.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00143","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875484.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Architectures for Electricity Consumption Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875484/","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Architectures for Electricity Consumption Forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875484/","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","accessionNumber":"19080203","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Architectures for Electricity Consumption Forecasting","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059648S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875487,"authors":[{"name":"Tsai-Ling Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsai-Ling","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37087046949"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086849734"},{"name":"Chun-Lung Hsu","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Lung","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37085566468"},{"name":"Chi-Tien Sun","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Tien","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086691626"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2261-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1550-5774"}],"articleNumber":"8875487","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":629},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875487","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","SRAM cells","Transistors","Leakage currents","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory array","IMC static random access memories","8T SRAM","IMC 8T","XOR logic operations","memory mode","computing mode","March C-8 test algorithm","in-memory-computing","memory wall","von-Neumann computing architecture","in-memory-computing architecture","IMC architecture","NAND logic operation","NOR logic operation","XOR logic operation","functional faults"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DFT.2019.8875487","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863044/8875268/08875487.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2019.8875487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing of In-Memory-Computing 8T SRAMs","abstract":"To cope with the memory wall of von-Neumann computing architecture, the in-memory-computing (IMC) architecture has been proposed.

To cope with energy problem, we propose a METS (Minimizing Execution Time Slot Scheduling Scheme) to reduce energy by rationally allocating the tasks across the GPUs. It first collects the estimated performance information. Next, it uses above information to formalize the scheduling problem as the 0-1 knapsack problem. Then, we elaborate our experiment on typical platform to verify proposed METS approach. The experimental results show that METS can save 8.43% energy compared with that of the existing approach. This shows that the proposed METS method is effective, reasonable and feasible.","doi":"10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00079","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8867850/8875257/08875504.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Scheduling Approach to Save Energy of Heterogeneous Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875504/","displayDocTitle":"Task Scheduling Approach to Save Energy of Heterogeneous Computing Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875504/","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2019","accessionNumber":"19091148","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Scheduling Approach to Save Energy of Heterogeneous Computing Systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"298000a353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076261S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8867850","isNumber":"8875257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8867850","xplore-issue":"8875257","articleId":"8875504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875549,"authors":[{"name":"Parth Chholak","affiliation":["Centro de Tecnolog\u00eda Biom\u00e9dica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Parth","lastName":"Chholak","id":"37087048527"},{"name":"Alexander N.

Motor imagery (MI) has turned out to be one of the most popular experimental regimes to study this system. Kinesthetic imagery (KI) is a kind of MI which shares a large portion of its neuronal pathway with real movements, except for having an additional inhibitory mechanism to prevent movement execution. Our magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiments with ten untrained subjects revealed that this inhibitory control implied local neuronal desynchronization. We found that the motor-related communication between the inferior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex was carried out using the mu-frequency range. Additionally, three gamma frequencies were also pinpointed that encode the motor command specifics. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs) we classified left- and right-hand MI which reached maximal accuracy when we included these three gamma frequencies in the input signal for ANN. We suggest that mu-activity acts as a carrier of gamma-activity between inferior and parietal areas utilising phase-amplitude coupling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Visualization","Protocols","Robots","Artificial neural networks","Electroencephalography","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","brain-computer interfaces","magnetoencephalography","medical signal processing","neural nets","neurophysiology","patient rehabilitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ANN","mu-activity","gamma-activity","inferior parietal areas","motor command specifics","right-hand MI","artificial neural networks","gamma frequencies","mu-frequency range","prefrontal cortex","inferior parietal cortex","motor-related communication","local neuronal desynchronization","inhibitory control","magnetoencephalographic experiments","movement execution","inhibitory mechanism","neuronal pathway","kinesthetic imagery","motor imagery","neuronal mechanism","motor system","stroke patients","neurorehabilitation","exoskeletons","brain computer interfaces","motor commands","gamma-waves","phase-amplitude coupling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["brain-computer interface","motor imagery","inhibition","neuronal communication","phase-amplitude coupling","artificial neural network","magnetoencephalography (MEG)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DCNAIR.2019.8875549","publicationTitle":"2019 3rd School on Dynamics of Complex Networks and their Application in Intellectual Robotics (DCNAIR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 3rd School on Dynamics of Complex Networks and their Application in Intellectual Robotics (DCNAIR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863089/8875510/08875549.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCNAIR.2019.8875549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-amplitude coupling between mu- and gamma-waves to carry motor commands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase-amplitude coupling between mu- and gamma-waves to carry motor commands","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875549/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875549/","accessionNumber":"19128295","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-amplitude coupling between mu- and gamma-waves to carry motor commands","confLoc":"Innopolis, Russia","sourcePdf":"DCNAIR2019039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116062S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8863089","isNumber":"8875510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863089","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8875510","articleId":"8875549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8875632,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyang Jia","affiliation":["Hot Chips"],"firstName":"Hongyang","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086027207"},{"name":"H.

More specifically, fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is selected in the closed-loop control system. The sensor read by the FLC is based on the reading from the CFD meshing finite element method (FEM) discretization in order to solve the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation. The controller output is the boundary condition of the CFD system (i.e heat flux). In this study, the CFD result will provide a predicted value approaching the set point. This system utilizes six rules for the controller. In order to evaluate the controller performance, several different set points are set. In addition, the genetic algorithm (GA) is set as the optimizer for the making of the sequence of the Mamdani triangular membership function. Finally, the GA is used to modify the membership function of the FLC. The total evaluation error for the FLC is 0.92 \u00b0C of the mean absolute error (MAE). Meanwhile, the GA-based FCL produces 0.78 \u00b0C of the MAE.","doi":"10.1109/CYBERNETICSCOM.2019.8875637","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864034/8875622/08875637.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBERNETICSCOM.2019.8875637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Fluid Dynamics Based Fuzzy Control Optimization of Heat Exchanger via Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating systems","Genetic algorithms","Computational fluid dynamics","Fuzzy logic","Boundary conditions","Biological cells","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","computational fluid dynamics","finite element analysis","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","heat exchangers","Navier-Stokes equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FLC","closed-loop control system","CFD meshing finite element method discretization","controller output","CFD system","heat flux","controller performance","set points","genetic algorithm","membership function","total evaluation error","GA-based FCL","computational fluid dynamics","fuzzy control optimization","heat exchanger application","fuzzy logic controller","temperature 0.92 degC","temperature 0.78 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computational fluid dynamics","artificial intelligence","fuzzy logic controller","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Computational Fluid Dynamics Based Fuzzy Control Optimization of Heat Exchanger via Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8875637/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079602","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Fluid Dynamics Based Fuzzy Control Optimization of Heat Exchanger via Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Banda Aceh, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570557190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071734S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864034","isNumber":"8875622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864034","xplore-issue":"8875622","articleId":"8875637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875643,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Yang","affiliation":["Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Yang","id":"37087046104"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2089-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2090-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-2048"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2573-203X"}],"articleNumber":"8875643","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"abstract":"Domain specific acceleration has a place in DL training, training time and model size continue to be bottlenecks.

network (CNN) models of ResNet101, DenseNet, MobileNetV2, and ShuffleNetV2 for breast cancer detection. These models have been tested using the ImageNet database and shown their high performance on the image classification. Here, the dataset used to train the model are thermal breast images downloaded from the Database for Mastology Research (DMR). There are only two classification classes here, cancer and healthy. During the training, we used three epochs for the training iteration, 10, 20, and 30. For this preliminary study, we set the learning rate to 0.001, momentum to 0.9, learning rate factor for weight and bias each to 10, and minibatch size to 10. The training results showed that ResNet101 and DenseNet with deep networks have 100% accuracy only in 10 epochs. Whereas, MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 respectively need 20 epochs and 30 epochs of training to achieve 100% accuracy. Finally, we evaluated the performance of each pretrained model using testing results. The DenseNet was able to classify all the testing dataset correctly. ResNet101 and MobileNetV2 have the same performance, correctly classified static dataset while slightly missed in classifying dynamic dataset with 0.996 of accuracy. ShuffleNetV2 has a little lower performance with only 0.98 of accuracy. In term of training time, ShuffleNetV2 spent a short duration, but MobileNetV2 with competitive elapse time was able to show equal performance to ResNet101.","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864034/8875622/08875661.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Fine-Tuning CNN Models Based on Thermal Imaging for Breast Cancer Classification","doi":"10.1109/CYBERNETICSCOM.2019.8875661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBERNETICSCOM.2019.8875661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Fine-Tuning CNN Models Based on Thermal Imaging for Breast Cancer Classification","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875661/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Fine-Tuning CNN Models Based on Thermal Imaging for Breast Cancer Classification","confLoc":"Banda Aceh, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570584317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056196S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864034","isNumber":"8875622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864034","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8875622","articleId":"8875661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875672,"authors":[{"name":"Nasaruddin Nasaruddin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nasaruddin","lastName":"Nasaruddin","id":"38095285800"},{"name":"Elizar Elizar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Elizar","lastName":"Elizar","id":"37086503150"},{"name":"Ramzi Adriman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ramzi","lastName":"Adriman","id":"37074745500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0867-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0866-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0868-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875672","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system reliability","Probability","Wireless LAN","Protocols","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","diversity reception","fading channels","multipath channels","probability","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WLAN","standard wireless communication technology","indoor environments","multimedia services","multipath fading","diversity techniques","communication systems","relay mechanism","multirelay orthogonal AF","nonorthogonal AF","network model","MR-OAF performance","MR-OAF protocol","standard IEEE 802.11ac","wireless local area network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Outage probability","Multi-relay","Orthogonal AF","Non-orthogonal AF","Cooperative WLANs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875672","doi":"10.1109/CYBERNETICSCOM.2019.8875672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBERNETICSCOM.2019.8875672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875622","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864034/8875622/08875672.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-relay Orthogonal and Non-orthogonal Amplify and Forward for Two-way Cooperative WLANs","abstract":"Wireless local area network (WLAN) is a standard wireless communication technology for indoor environments due to its flexibility and mobility. This technology is expected to provide high-speed wireless multimedia services. However, this wireless communication technology has to face two major problems: interference and multipath fading. One of the diversity techniques has been recognized as an effective solution to overcome the problems, known as cooperative communication systems where sources send information to destinations through some other nodes (relays). In this system, the relay mechanism uses amplify and forward (AF) protocol as an essential role in forwarding information to the destination. This paper examines the performance of multi-relay orthogonal AF (MR-OAF) and non-orthogonal AF (MR-NAF) in two-way cooperative WLANs. Then, the proposed network model is simulated to obtain the performance in terms of outage probability and throughput. The simulation results show that MR-OAF performance is better than MR-NAF in two-way cooperative WLAN. Thus, the MR-OAF protocol is an appropriate method to two-way cooperative WLANs, especially for standard IEEE 802.11ac.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875672/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079615","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-relay Orthogonal and Non-orthogonal Amplify and Forward for Two-way Cooperative WLANs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-relay Orthogonal and Non-orthogonal Amplify and Forward for Two-way Cooperative WLANs","confLoc":"Banda Aceh, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570577440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04936S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864034","isNumber":"8875622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864034","xplore-issue":"8875622","articleId":"8875672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8875680,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrice Devaux","affiliation":["CTO & co-founder"],"firstName":"Fabrice","lastName":"Devaux","id":"37087053718"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2089-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2090-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-2048"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2573-203X"}],"articleNumber":"8875680","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Random access memory","Program processors","Servers","Big Data","Bandwidth","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","microprocessor chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","system-on-chip","learning (artificial intelligence)","cache storage","inference mechanisms","performance evaluation","security","neural chips","memory architecture","graphics processing units"]}],"abstract":"The following topics are dealt with: microprocessor chips; system-on-chip; learning (artificial intelligence); cache storage; inference mechanisms; performance evaluation; security; neural chips; memory architecture; graphics processing units.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The true Processing In Memory accelerator","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE Hot Chips 31 Symposium (HCS)","doi":"10.1109/HOTCHIPS.2019.8875680","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE Hot Chips 31 Symposium (HCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869546/8875627/08875680.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTCHIPS.2019.8875680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"The true Processing In Memory accelerator","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"20213550","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The true Processing In Memory accelerator","confLoc":"Cupertino, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"HC31_1_4_UPMEM_FabriceDevaux_v2_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065442S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2019","isNumber":"8875627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869546","citationCount":"7","articleId":"8875680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875709,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfeng Lu","affiliation":["Xidian University"],"bio":{"p":["Yunfeng Lu (yunfeng.lu.xidian@foxmail.com) received his B.E. degree in information technology from Jilin University in 2016.

On one hand, it is difficult for the fixed network topology to match the traffic patterns of different neural networks. On the other hand, the rapid growth of training data, model size, and computing requirements has led to an ever-increasing scale of data center networks. Traditional electrical interconnects lack the ability to adjust the network topology and communication bandwidth, resulting in significant resource waste and high expansion costs. Optical interconnects are introduced to solve the above problems because of its high bandwidth, low power consumption, and reconfigurability. In this article, the optical interconnects in recent years are analyzed in detail, and the flexibility and scalability of different networks are compared qualitatively. The future trends and challenges of optical interconnects in data centers are discussed from the aspects of optical transmission technology, optical switching technology, and optical network control and management.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875709/","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8875709/","accessionNumber":"19061987","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Flexible and Scalable Optical Interconnects for Data Centers: Trends and Challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible and Scalable Optical Interconnects for Data Centers: Trends and Challenges","sourcePdf":"013GU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031545S","chronDate":"October  2019","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8875694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8875694","articleId":"8875709","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8875710,"authors":[{"name":"Mingliang Xiong","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University"],"bio":{"p":["Mingliang Xiong (xiongml@tongji.edu.cn) received his B.Eng. degree in communications engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2017.

This article provides a perspective of fusion of three emerging technologies: SDN, EC, and blockchain technology for wireless network virtualization. SDN, with the help of controllers, allows dynamic configuration of network resources for their efficient management. EC not only helps to process user signals and queries at respective base stations with the shortest possible delay, but also helps to avoid the need of a high-speed backhaul link between a base station and centralized controllers. Blockchain technology protects owners of wireless infrastructures from a double spending attack that allocates the same wireless resource (RF slice) to multiple virtual wireless networks.

However, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) of vehicles just deploy the preset statics strategies. As a novel security technology, blockchain can realize decentralized tamper- resistance. However, it has not been used for IDSs because of its rigid structure. In this article, we propose Micro-Blockchain based geographical dynamic Intrusion Detection, MBID, for V2X. A novel nested micro-blockchain structure is proposed, where each micro-blockchain deployed in a small region can construct local intrusion detection strategies for vehicles with tamper- resistance. When a vehicle moves to another region, spatial-temporal dynamic IDSs strategies are constructed through the proposed repeatedly nested scheme for micro-blockchains. Moreover, the control plane is proposed to dynamically configure IDSs strategies into the micro-blockchain.

However, some vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services need secure transmissions and should be prevented from eavesdropping. Physical layer security, an information- theoretical framework, utilizes the randomness of underlying channels to ensure secrecy in the physical layer. Different from ground communications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) create line-of-sight connections to vehicles and mobile users making them an ideal platform to conduct physical layer security strategies. In this article, we embrace UAV to V2X communications to enhance the V2X security from the physical layer security's perspective. To be specific, we present security problems in V2X systems, highlight security threats in V2X networks, and illustrate some potential applications of UAVs in V2X security. Open problems for UAV-assisted V2X secure communications are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.001.1900170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8875694/08875722.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.001.1900170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Meets Vehicle-to-Everything in Secure Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Meets Vehicle-to-Everything in Secure Communications","volume":"57","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19061993","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8875722/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875722/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Meets Vehicle-to-Everything in Secure Communications","sourcePdf":"026LIU1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066413S","chronDate":"October  2019","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8875694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8875694","articleId":"8875722","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8875870,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In particular, one of the most up-to-date structures of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has achieved great success in this field. Real-time works related to CNNs are carried out by using GPU-Graphics Processing Units. Although GPUs provides high stability, they requires high power, energy consumption, and large computational load problems. In order to overcome this problem, it has started to used the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In this article, object detection and recognition procedures were performed using the ZYNQ XC7Z020 development board including both the ARM processor and the FPGA.

In this study, two categories of emotion analysis were studied with data obtained from many social networks. Also, there is a feeling class on a topic on Twitter, and text is summarized in the class. Sentiment analysis considered a classification problem. To increase the success rate, the study was carried out by focusing on the words with semantic context word embedding methods. LSA is used for text summarization. In this study, where both emotion analysis and text summation are carried out, the main goal is to analyze the sentiments and thoughts about a subject and present brief information to the user.

The proposed adaptive gradient descent control method is a variant of direct gradient descent control. The study aims to implement an adaptive control scheme for modeling-free control of stable, first-order, time delay plant models. The method implements two gradient descent optimizers. The first one performs only for synthesis of control signal, and the second optimizer works for a short-time model prediction based on instant input-output relation of a plant. We use a time-varying finite impulse response (TV-FIR) form to approximate short-term input-output relations of a first order stable plant dynamics and this work is an extended version of adaptive gradient descent control schemes that were presented in [6] and [7]. Adaptation and control laws are derived for this FIR model premise according to gradient descent method. The robust control performance of the proposed control method is investigated according to simulation results and compared with performance of optimal PI controller designs.","publicationTitle":"2019 International Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing Symposium (IDAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing Symposium (IDAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864030/8875868/08875966.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAP.2019.8875966","doi":"10.1109/IDAP.2019.8875966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Gradient Descent Control of Stable, First Order, Time-delay Dynamic Systems According to Time-Varying FIR Filter Model Assumption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Gradient Descent Control of Stable, First Order, Time-delay Dynamic Systems According to Time-Varying FIR Filter Model Assumption","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8875966/","conferenceDate":"21-22 Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079362","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Sept. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Gradient Descent Control of Stable, First Order, Time-delay Dynamic Systems According to Time-Varying FIR Filter Model Assumption","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058001S","chronDate":"21-22 Sept. 2019","isNumber":"8875868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864030","articleId":"8875966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8875985,"authors":[{"name":"Yunus Santur","affiliation":["Department of Informatic, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yunus","lastName":"Santur","id":"37085776491"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2932-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2933-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8875985","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sentiment analysis","Logic gates","Machine learning","Task analysis","Graphics processing units","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advertising data processing","electronic commerce","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","recurrent neural nets","sentiment analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sentiment analysis","Gated Recurrent Unit","customer churn analysis","machine learning","one text classification","brand strategy","brand advertisement","Turkish e-commercial platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gated Recurrent Unit","Natural Language Processing","Sentiment Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8875985","abstract":"Sentiment analysis is a term which is used for classification one text is positive, negative or neutral.

In what concerns the embedded processing capabilities, the focus is image processing using convolutional neuronal networks (CNN). This approach is clearly distinct from the current trends in IoT devices of using cloud computing to process the collected data. We intend a twist on the established paradigm and pursue an edge computing approach. Since we are targeting small and simple devices, we need some low power solution for the CNN computation. The demonstration will be made on a Terasic DE1 (SoC) reconfigurable system, with a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and hardwired ARM processor to build the IoT device. The collected data from the CNN computation, is transmitted using an IoT protocol to a broker.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Performance evaluation","Image processing","Edge computing","Cameras","Protocols","VHDL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","Internet of Things","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network implementation","IoT device","raw data","embedded processing capabilities","image processing","convolutional neuronal networks","edge computing approach","CNN computation","IoT protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge Computing","FPGA","IoT","CNN","ARM","HPS","Intelligent Devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876463","doi":"10.1109/EXPAT.2019.8876463","startPage":"244","endPage":"246","publicationTitle":"2019 5th Experiment International Conference (exp.at'19)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 5th Experiment International Conference (exp.at'19)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856150/8876462/08876463.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EXPAT.2019.8876463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876463/","displayDocTitle":"Edge Computing: A Neural Network Implementation on an IoT Device","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19078946","htmlLink":"/document/8876463/","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Computing: A Neural Network Implementation on an IoT Device","confLoc":"Funchal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"ieee051_expat19_paper_fv_079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048704S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8856150","isNumber":"8876462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8856150","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8876462","articleId":"8876463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876475,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Massao Kagami","affiliation":["Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program \u2013 PPGEPS, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Paran\u00e1 \u2013 PUCPR, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo Massao","lastName":"Kagami","id":"37087046304"},{"name":"Guinther Kovalski da Costa","affiliation":["Department of Control and Automation Engineering, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Paran\u00e1 - PUCPR, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guinther","lastName":"Kovalski da Costa","id":"37087050343"},{"name":"Luciano Ant\u00f4nio Mendes","affiliation":["Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program \u2013 PPGEPS, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Paran\u00e1 \u2013 PUCPR, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano Ant\u00f4nio","lastName":"Mendes","id":"38469457900"},{"name":"Roberto Zanetti Freire","affiliation":["Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program \u2013 PPGEPS, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Paran\u00e1 \u2013 PUCPR, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Roberto Zanetti","lastName":"Freire","id":"37592350700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3636-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3638-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8876475","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876475","abstract":"By associating active learning methodologies and digital media as a form to improve educational quality, the diversity of experimentations in engineering education has been motivating researches in many areas with possibilities of increasing both students' knowledge and skills.

An appliance scheduling problem is addressed via optimisation approaches with the goal of minimising the overall energy bill over a week. Scheduling of electrical appliances must take into account non-controllable domestic demand, grid prices and local energy production by photovoltaic panels. Here, a preliminary cloud architecture is proposed to support smart home sensor data collection, storage, processing and scheduling computation. Optimal schedules achieve a balance between local energy production and grid prices, exploring periods of higher generation to attenuate non-controllable demands and favouring night periods (during which energy is cheaper) for controllable appliances operations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 5th Experiment International Conference (exp.at'19)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856150/8876462/08876531.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"2019 5th Experiment International Conference (exp.at'19)","doi":"10.1109/EXPAT.2019.8876531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EXPAT.2019.8876531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Home Energy Management Supported by Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Home appliances","Smart homes","Processor scheduling","Optimal scheduling","Production","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","cloud computing","demand side management","domestic appliances","energy management systems","home automation","optimisation","power engineering computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["appliance scheduling problem","optimisation approaches","electrical appliances","grid prices","local energy production","preliminary cloud architecture","optimal schedules","noncontrollable demands","controllable appliances operations","smart home energy management","cloud computing","optimal management","smart homes","noncontrollable domestic demand"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cyber-Physical Systems","Home Energy Management Systems","Mixed-Integer Programming","Smart Homes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Smart Home Energy Management Supported by Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876531/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"19078992","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Home Energy Management Supported by Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Funchal, Portugal","sourcePdf":"ieee019_expat19_paper_fv_006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087142S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8856150","isNumber":"8876462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8856150","xplore-issue":"8876462","articleId":"8876531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876596,"authors":[{"name":"Mingfeng Jiang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8876596/jiang-2948220-small.gif","p":["Mingfeng Jiang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in biomedical engineering from Chongqing University, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2008.

In the architecture, we used the fine-tuning method for accurate training of the neural network parameters and the Wasserstein distance as the discrepancy measure between the real and reconstructed images. Furthermore, for better preservation of the fine structures in the reconstructed images, we incorporated perceptual loss, image and frequency loss into the loss function for training the network. With experimental results from 3 different sampling schemes and 3 levels of sampling rates, we compared the reconstruction performance of the DA-FWGAN method with other state-of-the-art deep learning methods for CS-MRI reconstruction, including ADMM-Net, Pixel-GAN, and DAGAN. The proposed DA-FWGAN method outperforms all other methods and can provide superior reconstruction with improved peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating CS-MRI Reconstruction With Fine-Tuning Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948220","startPage":"152347","endPage":"152357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08876596.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating CS-MRI Reconstruction With Fine-Tuning Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8876596/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087062","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672466, 61671405 and 61701435"},{"fundingName":"Joint Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"LSZ19F010001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY17H180003"},{"fundingName":"Science Technology Department of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LGG18H180001"},{"fundingName":"521 Talents project of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Accelerating CS-MRI Reconstruction With Fine-Tuning Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network","sourcePdf":"access-jiang-2948220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175919S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8876596","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876612,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed A.

A single controller due to its limited capacity and resources may not handle heavy load traffic generated from various smart devices. In order to handle this, multiple controllers need to be deployed at the control plane so as to ensure improved efficiency and scalability of the network. The data flow by the distributed controllers fluctuates frequently which results in an uneven load distribution amongst different controllers. So, to handle the aforementioned issues, in this paper, a Load Optimization and Anomaly Detection Scheme (LOADS) is proposed. Using LOADS, the probability of switch selection is determined using the following two factors (i) distance from the switch to the controller, and (ii) resource consumption ratio of the switch to its controller. Also, an IP flow-based network anomaly detection module has been designed to classify the traffic as malicious or normal. In order to address the network anomaly, the LOADS scheme uses Access Control Policies (ACPs) on the user's behavior in the network. The proposed scheme is evaluated on Mininet emulator using POX controller with datasets of Internet Topology Zoo from BTNorthAmerica zone. The performance analysis reveals that LOADS minimizes the average execution time by 6.74% and 20.64% as compared to the existing competitive schemes, Distributed Hopping Algorithm (DHA) and Elastic Distributed Controller (ElastiCon). Also, it helps in improving the overall migration cost and response time of each controller. The proposed LOADS scheme has the migration cost of 55.1 milliseconds as compared to the ElastiCon and DHA schemes alongwith the migration cost of 110 milliseconds and 140 milliseconds respectively. In addition to the migration cost, the response time of the proposed scheme is 32.8 milliseconds as compared to DHA and ElastiCon which takes almost 90 milliseconds and 78 milliseconds respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2019.2948222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8935346/08876615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2019.2948222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8935346","startPage":"12329","endPage":"12344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LOADS: Load Optimization and Anomaly Detection Scheme for Software-Defined Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LOADS: Load Optimization and Anomaly Detection Scheme for Software-Defined Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19404529","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8876615/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"INDO-POLAND Joint Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010218","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"DST/INT/POL/P-34/2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LOADS: Load Optimization and Anomaly Detection Scheme for Software-Defined Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-kumar-2948222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11377S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8935346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8935346","articleId":"8876615","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876617,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zeng","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8955685/8876617/zeng-2948281-small.gif","p":["Jie Zeng (M\u201909\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, in 2019.","Since 2009, he has been with Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University.

FD-SCMA can support short-packet transmissions of several SCMA users in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) simultaneously by an FD next generation node B (gNB). First, the gNB and UL users can generate and superpose signals according to the preconfigured SCMA codebooks, and simultaneously transmit the signals via occupied subcarriers in a joint SCMA pattern. The receivers at the gNB and DL users can demodulate and decode the signals with multiuser detection (MUD). With the imperfect self-interference suppression (SIS) of FD considered, the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of FD-SCMA at the gNB and DL users is formulated. The error probability of FD-SCMA in the UL and DL is also derived under a given transmission latency constraint of short-packet transmissions. In the stationary flat-fading channel, it is proved that FD-SCMA can achieve better reliability than the existing FD and SCMA schemes. In the time-invariant frequency-selective fading channel, the upper bounds for error probability of the UL and DL users in FD-SCMA are derived, respectively.

It was fabricated with a TSMC 0.18\u03bcm 1P6M CMOS process. An additional current feedback path (ACFP) technique was incorporated to avoid subharmonic oscillation of the converter without a large equivalent series resistance (ESR) capacitor, thus reducing the output voltage ripple. However, the ACFP causes an offset voltage on the converter's output voltage dc level with loading changes. The proposed offset cancellation can remove the dc level from current sensor in ACFP. Hence, the offset voltage can be reduced through a proposed offset cancellation technique. The experimental results revealed that the offset voltage of the proposed converter is 8mV under a 0.1A to 1A loading changes.

In this paper, a novel compensation method is proposed based on the BP neural network under the TensorFlow architecture. Comparing with the existing methods, the new method does not depend upon an accurate model of the MVS any more, whose parameters are badly influenced by the temperature. The dynamic compensator is connected with the sensor. The BP neural network algorithm is used to identify compensation parameters. The dynamic compensator works at state of the optimum parameter all the time to compensate the dynamic performance of MVS by training the weights and thresholds of the neural network. The experiment results show that velocity measurement deviation is within \u00b15% error band by the dynamic compensator, which can reduce the measurement deviation caused by the variation of temperature and improve the measurement accuracy. The bandwidth can be as low as 0.28Hz. The dynamic compensator is superior to Random Forests and RBF Neutral Network in implement in FPGA/CPLD. Its' accuracy is superior to zero-pole compensation method. This method leads a new way to weaken the temperature variation characteristics of the velocity sensor and improve the measurement performance.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948261","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08876627.pdf","startPage":"154889","endPage":"154898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending Velocity Sensor Bandwidth by Compensating Temperature Dependency Based on BP Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Extending Velocity Sensor Bandwidth by Compensating Temperature Dependency Based on BP Neural Network","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"19087517","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8876627/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Major Scientific Instruments and Equipment Development Special Funds of China","grantNumber":"2018YFF01012003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Extending Velocity Sensor Bandwidth by Compensating Temperature Dependency Based on BP Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-shi-2948261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142283S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8876627","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8876629,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqiang Yi","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8962108/8876629/yi-2947928-small.gif","p":["Wenqiang Yi (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in optical information science and technology from the Wuhan University of Technology, China, in 2012, the M.S. degree in wireless communications and signal processing from the University of Bristol, U.K., in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from the Centre for Telecommunications Research, Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London, in September 2016.

In this paper, an effective spatial framework for mmWave vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks with VPSs is proposed by utilizing stochastic geometry approaches. Base stations (BSs) are modeled by a Poisson point process and vehicles are distributed according to multiple type II Mat\u00e9rn hard-core processes. To characterize the blockage process caused by vehicles, a closed-form expression is deduced to distinguish line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS transmission. This expression demonstrates that LOS links are independent of horizontal communication distances. Several closed-form probability density functions of the communication distance between a reference platoon and its serving transmitter (other platoons or BSs) are derived for analyzing the generated path loss. After designing three practical user association techniques, tractable expressions for coverage probabilities are figured out. Our work theoretically shows that the maximum density of VPSs exists and large antenna scales benefit the networks' coverage performance. The numerical results illustrate that platoons outperform individual vehicles in terms of road spectral efficiency and the considered system is LOS interference-limited.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8962108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8962108/08876629.pdf","startPage":"2851","endPage":"2866","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of MmWave V2X Networks With Vehicular Platoon Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of MmWave V2X Networks With Vehicular Platoon Systems","volume":"37","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8876629/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19348937","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N029720/2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of MmWave V2X Networks With Vehicular Platoon Systems","sourcePdf":"jsac-liu-2947928-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143083S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8962108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8962108","articleId":"8876629","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8876636,"authors":[{"name":"Sarankumar Balakrishnan","affiliation":["University at Buffalo, Buffalo, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8833568/8876636/balak-2948283-small.gif","p":["Sarankumar Balakrishnan (S\u201913) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Pondicherry University, India, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2013.

While conventional security measures in wireless networks operate at a higher layer of the protocol stack, physical layer security utilizes unique device dependent hardware features to identify and authenticate legitimate devices. In this work, we identify that the manufacturing tolerances in the antenna arrays used in mmWave devices contribute to a beam pattern that is unique to each device, and to that end we propose a novel device fingerprinting scheme based on the unique beam pattern of different codebooks used by the mmWave devices. Specifically, we propose a fingerprinting scheme with multiple access points (APs) to take advantage of the rich spatial-temporal information of the beam pattern. We perform comprehensive experiments with commercial off-the-shelf mmWave devices to validate the reliability performance of our proposed method under various scenarios. We also compare our beam pattern feature with a conventional physical layer feature namely power spectral density feature (PSD). To that end, we implement PSD feature based fingerprinting for mmWave devices. We show that the proposed multiple APs scheme is able to achieve over 99% identification accuracy for stationary LOS and NLOS scenarios and significantly outperform the PSD feature fingerprinting method. For mobility scenario, the overall identification accuracy is 99%. In addition, we perform security analysis of our proposed beam pattern fingerprinting system and PSD fingerprinting system by studying the feasibility of performing impersonation attacks. We design and implement an impersonation attack mechanism for mmWave wireless networks using state-of-the-art 60 GHz software defined radios. We discuss our findings and their implications on the security of the mmWave wireless networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2019.2948283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8833568","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1845","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8833568/08876636.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Identification Based on Spatial\u2013Temporal Beam Features for Millimeter-Wave Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8876636/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Identification Based on Spatial\u2013Temporal Beam Features for Millimeter-Wave Wireless Networks","publicationDate":"2020","accessionNumber":"19289482","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007000","fundingName":"Laboratory Directed Research and Development","grantNumber":"DE-AC07-05ID14517"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer Identification Based on Spatial\u2013Temporal Beam Features for Millimeter-Wave Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-sun-2948283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100084S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8833568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8833568","articleId":"8876636","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8876639,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Amir Reza Kazemi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Amir Reza","lastName":"Kazemi","id":"37087045530"},{"name":"Rouhollah Amiri","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Rouhollah","lastName":"Amiri","id":"37085513180"},{"name":"Fereidoon Behnia","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fereidoon","lastName":"Behnia","id":"37529587200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8876639","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","MIMO radar","Noise measurement","Position measurement","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","direction-of-arrival estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO radar","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient convex solution","MIMO radars","3-D target localization","distributed multiple-input multiple-output radars","angle of arrival measurements","approximately equivalent maximum likelihood estimation problem","convex optimization problem","semiclosed-form solution","Cramer-Rao lower bound","Gaussian measurement noise levels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Target localization","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","time delay (TD)","angle of arrival (AOA)","Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)","constrained maximum likelihood (ML) estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an efficient estimator for 3-D target localization in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars using time delay (TD) and angle of arrival (AOA) measurements is proposed.

Reset control has been shown to possess great potential to improve transient system performance, but reset-induced state jump dynamics bring difficulties for consensus analysis, especially under the network environment. In this article, a novel reset element is developed, and time regularization is utilized to exclude Zeno behavior. The case with continuous communication is first considered, a distributed proportional integral + reset consensus protocol is proposed, which consists of the proportional-integral controller and the reset mechanism. The results are further generalized to the case with asynchronous sampling, which relaxes the requirement for continuous communication and clock synchronization. A hybrid model of the MAS is constructed to describe the system dynamics, and a hybrid systems approach is proposed to handle the reset- and sampling-induced jump dynamics in a unified framework. Moreover, a novel Lyapunov function is proposed and LMI-based stability conditions are given.

Calculations of the change in CNR for practical gain, noise, and bandwidth parameters indicate the maximum obtainable CNR enhancement factor and output CNR as being \u224825 dB and \u224840~43 dB/0.1 nm, respectively, limited by the narrowness of the Brillouin gain bandwidth and Brillouin amplifier noise, respectively. These limits determined from the relative power suppression of out of band noise contained within a 10 GHz channel bandwidth are relevant to spectral line amplification either before data modulation at the transmitter, or for a local oscillator (LO) at the receiver for coherent detection. A calibration measurement of the bit error rate (BER) of a 48 Gb/s 64-QAM signal versus CNR of a LO loaded with ASE noise is used to extrapolate the BER from the calculated CNR for Brillouin gain. The results predict the BER being minimally degraded for an input CNR of \u2248>20 dB/0.1 nm and falling below the hard decision FEC limit for an input CNR as low as \u22480 dB/0.1 nm. The estimates are found consistent with 64QAM signal experiments of pilot tone carrier recovery by Brillouin gain for both single channel and WDM cases. The insight aids the design and estimation of achievable performance improvement for applying Brillouin amplifiers to coherent communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8966974/08876646.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2019.2948226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2019.2948226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8966974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Carrier to Noise Ratio by Brillouin Amplification for Optical Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Optical fiber amplifiers","Gain","Bandwidth","Bit error rate","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","error statistics","extrapolation","forward error correction","optical communication","optical fibre amplifiers","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical signal detection","optical transmitters","quadrature amplitude modulation","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Brillouin amplification","optical communications","narrowband Brillouin gain","64-QAM communications","bandwidth parameters","output CNR","Brillouin gain bandwidth","Brillouin amplifier noise","relative power suppression","out-of-band noise","channel bandwidth","spectral line amplification","BER","ASE noise","calculated CNR","input CNR","hard decision FEC limit","pilot tone carrier recovery","Brillouin amplifiers","coherent communications","enhanced carrier to noise ratio","CNR enhancement factor","64-QAM signal experiments","WDM","data modulation","calibration measurement","size 0.1 nm","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","bandwidth 10.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brillouin scattering","nonlinear optics","optical fiber communication","optical signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Carrier to Noise Ratio by Brillouin Amplification for Optical Communications","volume":"38","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8876646/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2020","accessionNumber":"19282107","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Project for Developing Innovation Systems of MEXT, Japan"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Fellowship and CUDOS Centre of Excellence","grantNumber":"FT110101037 and CE110001018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Carrier to Noise Ratio by Brillouin Amplification for Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"jlt-pelusi-2948226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109722S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2020","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8966974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8966974","articleId":"8876646","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876647,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Binh Truong","affiliation":["Data Science Institute, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8833568/8876647/truon-2948287-small.gif","p":["Nguyen Binh Truong received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees from Liverpool John Moores University, U.K., Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea, and Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam, in 2008, 2013, and 2018, respectively.

As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2019.2948287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2019.2948287","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8833568/08876647.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8833568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GDPR-Compliant Personal Data Management: A Blockchain-Based Solution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"GDPR-Compliant Personal Data Management: A Blockchain-Based Solution","volume":"15","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19272851","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2020","htmlLink":"/document/8876647/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000761","fundingName":"Imperial College London"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"GDPR-Compliant Personal Data Management: A Blockchain-Based Solution","sourcePdf":"tifs-truong-2948287-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121913S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8833568","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8833568","articleId":"8876647","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876651,"authors":[{"name":"Felipe Wilches-Bernal","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Felipe Wilches-Bernal (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the M.S. degree in control systems and signal processing from Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud XI, Orsay, France, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA.

This paper proposes a novel methodology to damp these inter-area oscillations using loads, the demand side of the system. In the proposed methodology, loads are assigned to an aggregated cluster whose demand is modulated for oscillation damping. The load cluster control action is obtained from an optimal output feedback control (OOFC) strategy. The paper presents an extension to the regular OOFC formulation by imposing a constraint on the sum of the rows in the optimal gain matrix. This constraint is useful when the feedback signals are generator speeds. In this case, the sum of the rows of the optimal gain matrix is the droop gain of each load actuator. Time-domain simulations of a large-scale power system are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm. Two different cases are considered: a power imbalance and a line fault. The simulation results show that the proposed controllers successfully damp inter-area oscillations under different operating conditions and with different clustering for the events considered. In addition, the simulations illustrate the benefit of the proposed extension to the OOFC that enable load to provide a combination of droop control and small signal stability augmentation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Oscillators","Power system stability","Damping","Load modeling","Modulation","Output feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","controllers","damping","demand side management","feedback","load regulation","matrix algebra","power system faults","power system interconnection","power system stability","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-area oscillations","oscillation damping","optimal output feedback control strategy","optimal gain matrix","load actuator","droop control","aggregated loads","low frequency electromechanical oscillations","power system stability","demand side management","load cluster control","OOFC formulation","time-domain simulations","line fault"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Small signal stability","damping control","load modulation","load aggregation","system identification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2948116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/9070029/08876651.pdf","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9070029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2948116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping of Inter-Area Oscillations via Modulation of Aggregated Loads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Damping of Inter-Area Oscillations via Modulation of Aggregated Loads","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876651/","volume":"35","issue":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"May 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8876651/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19531387","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grid Modernization Lab Consortium"},{"fundingName":"U.S. DOE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Damping of Inter-Area Oscillations via Modulation of Aggregated Loads","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wilchesbernal-2948116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076325S","chronDate":"May  2020","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"9070029","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9070029","articleId":"8876651","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8876654,"authors":[{"name":"Ananda Maiti","affiliation":["Discipline of ICT, University of Tasmania, Launceston, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8876654/maiti-2948269-small.gif","p":["Ananda Maiti received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia, in 2016.

Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial process. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework. The paper uses supply chain as a use case scenario for describing the proposed framework and presents results on its technical feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08876654.pdf","startPage":"155489","endPage":"155503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Service Quality in Industrial Internet-of-Things Monitoring Applications With Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Service Quality in Industrial Internet-of-Things Monitoring Applications With Blockchain","volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087759","htmlLink":"/document/8876654/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Estimating Service Quality in Industrial Internet-of-Things Monitoring Applications With Blockchain","sourcePdf":"access-maiti-2948269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106636S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8876654","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876656,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Huzhou University, Huzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9488261/8876656/wu-2944987-small.gif","p":["Xiaohong Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, in 1996 and 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China, in June 2019.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Information Engineering, Huzhou University, Huzhou, China.

To improve the users' utility of purchased resources, according to the historical bidding information, we present data-driven cloud resource procurement (CRP) auctions which can help the resource buyer make an optimized selection for cloud resources. First, we design two procurement auction mechanisms with personalized reserve prices for CRP: Lazy-CRP and Eager-CRP, in which the reserve prices are set by the broker before the auction based on the broker's knowledge about costs of cloud providers. Then, given the assumption that each cloud provider is myopic, we propose the optimal learning algorithms of personalized reserve prices for the Lazy-CRP approach, and 2-approximation learning algorithm for the Eager-CRP approach. Both of two algorithms can be performed even if the cost distribution functions of cloud providers are nonidentical. By comparing our mechanisms with Vickery-Clark-Groves CRP (VCG-CRP) in simulation, the results show that our proposed mechanism is very suitable for occasions where the number of providers is very small. According to the results of the simulation, the total utilities obtained by the data-driven procurement schemes are significantly higher than VCG-CRP when the number of cloud providers is less than four. When there are only two providers, the increased total utility of our mechanism can be up to 80% of that obtained by VCG-CRP.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2019.2944987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2019.2944987","startPage":"4693","endPage":"4705","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and

a common clinical practice that enables medical doctors to diagnose various lesions inside a stomach. In order to identify the location of a gastric lesion such as early cancer and a peptic ulcer within the stomach, this work addresses to reconstruct the color-textured 3D model of a whole stomach from a standard monocular endoscope video and localize any selected video frame to the 3D model. We examine how to enable structure-from-motion (SfM) to reconstruct the whole shape of a stomach from endoscope images, which is a challenging task due to the texture-less nature of the stomach surface. We specifically investigate the combined effect of chromo-endoscopy and color channel selection on SfM to increase the number of feature points. We also design a plane fitting-based algorithm for 3D point outliers removal to improve the 3D model quality. We show that whole stomach 3D reconstruction can be achieved (more than 90% of the frames can be reconstructed) by using red channel images captured under chromo-endoscopy by spreading indigo carmine (IC) dye on the stomach surface. In experimental results, we demonstrate the reconstructed 3D models for seven subjects and the application of lesion localization and reconstruction. The methodology and results presented in this paper could offer some valuable reference to other researchers and also could be an excellent tool for gastric surgeons in various computer-aided diagnosis applications.","doi":"10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2946802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8579633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2946802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221039/8579633/08876662.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whole Stomach 3D Reconstruction and Frame Localization From Monocular Endoscope Video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Whole Stomach 3D Reconstruction and Frame Localization From Monocular Endoscope Video","volume":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876662/","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"3300310","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087127","pubMedId":"32309059","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876662/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"17H00744"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Whole Stomach 3D Reconstruction and Frame Localization From Monocular Endoscope Video","sourcePdf":"jtehm-widya-2946802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14112S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221039","isNumber":"8579633","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221039","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8579633","articleId":"8876662","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876665,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hung Liu","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, Starkville, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8962108/8876665/liu-2947922-small.gif","p":["Chun-Hung Liu (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, TX, USA.

To reduce handover signaling overhead, the ground BSs take charge of control signaling delivery whereas the UAVs are in charge of payload data transmission so that users need to be simultaneously associated with a ground BS and a UAV in this network with a control-data plane-split architecture. We first propose a three-dimensional (3D) location distribution model of the UAVs using stochastic geometry which is able to generally characterize the positions of the UAVs in the sky. Using this 3D distribution model of UAVs, two performance metrics, i.e., multi-cell coverage probability and volume spectral efficiency, are proposed. Their explicit low-complexity expressions are derived and their upper limits are found when each of the UAVs and ground BSs is equipped with a massive antenna array. We further show that the multi-cell coverage probability and the volume spectral efficiency can be maximized by optimally deploying and positioning the UAVs in the sky and thereby their fundamental maximal limits are found. These important analytical findings are validated by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947922","startPage":"2814","endPage":"2831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8962108/08876665.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8962108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MmWave UAV Networks With Multi-Cell Association: Performance Limit and Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"MmWave UAV Networks With Multi-Cell Association: Performance Limit and Optimization","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19348938","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8876665/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007250","fundingName":"Mississippi State University","grantNumber":"ORED 253551-060702"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 108-2221-E-009-025-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MmWave UAV Networks With Multi-Cell Association: Performance Limit and Optimization","sourcePdf":"jsac-liu-2947922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131402S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8962108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8962108","articleId":"8876665","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876667,"authors":[{"name":"Botao Zhu","affiliation":["Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8876667/zhu-2948191-small.gif","p":["Botao Zhu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Automation, Hubei University of Automotive Technology, in 2017.

In this study, a microfluidic platform was built to measure the mechanical properties of cells by using dielectrophoretic (DEP) force. The electrodes generally used to stretch cells are made of indium tin oxide, Au, and Pt, which have inherent disadvantages. In this paper, galinstan alloy liquid metal was first introduced as microelectrode to form non-uniform electric filed for red blood cell stretching manipulation. The liquid metal microelectrode is easy to manufacture, low in price, stable at high voltage, and reusable. An effective microfluidic chip integrated with liquid metal electrode was designed and simulated, and a series of experiments to capture and stretch red blood cells was performed. The length of the red blood cells increased from 6 \u03bcm to 8 \u03bcm under the DEP force from 0 pN to 103 pN. This work also revealed the potential use of liquid metal as microelectrode to manipulate the microparticles and cells in a microfluidic chip.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

resolution over a wide range of electromagnetic spectra, have been widely used to characterize materials with subtle differences in the spectral domain. However, a large number of bands and an insufficient number of sample pixels for each class are challenging for traditional machine learning-based classifiers. As alternative tools for feature extraction, neural networks have received extensive attention. This letter proposes to combine t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for HSI classification. Our framework is designed to automatically capture the potential assembly features, which are extracted from both the dimension-reduced CNN (DR-CNN) and the multiscale-CNN. Experimental results show that the proposed classification framework outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques for three real data sets.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2019.2945122","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1372","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/9145892/08876672.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2019.2945122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9145892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding With Convolutional Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Kernel","Hyperspectral imaging","Manifolds","Data mining","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","feature extraction","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","image resolution","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","convolutional neural network","HSI classification","dimension-reduced CNN","DR-CNN","classification framework","t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding","hyperspectral image classification","high spectral resolution","electromagnetic spectra","spectral domain","machine learning-based classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Assembly fusion","convolutional neural network (CNN)","dimensionality reduction","hyperspectral image (HSI) classification","t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Combining t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding With Convolutional Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification","volume":"17","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8876672/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2020","accessionNumber":"19809113","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41722108 and 91638201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding With Convolutional Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-gao-2945122-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063285S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"9145892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9145892","articleId":"8876672","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8876674,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyu Zhan","affiliation":["EE Department, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8948273/8876674/zhan-2948301-small.gif","p":["Tianyu Zhan received the B.Eng. degree in electronic science and technology from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2019.

First, the design, VLSI implementation, and experimental validation of a resource-optimized machine learning algorithm for epilepsy seizure detection are described. Next, the development of a mini-PCB that integrates a low-power wireless data transceiver and a programmable processor for hosting the seizure detection algorithm is discussed. The algorithm uses only EEG signals from the frontal lobe electrodes while yielding a seizure detection sensitivity and specificity competitive to the standard full EEG systems. The experimental validation of the algorithm VLSI implementation proves the possibility of conducting accurate seizure detection using quickly-mountable dry-electrode headsets without the need for uncomfortable/painful through-hair electrodes or adhesive gels. Details of design and optimization of the algorithm, the VLSI implementation, and the mini-PCB development are presented and resource optimization techniques are discussed.

Inertia estimation is carried out based on measured frequency response for any arbitrary disturbance that occurs in the system. Modifications are made to the conventional swing equation-based curve-fitting method to obtain an accurate estimate for a system with high penetration of renewable generations. A polynomial curve fit over the total power generation is introduced to estimate the size of the disturbance accurately. Additionally, a variable order polynomial fit is carried out over the measured frequency, which not only improves the estimate of inertia but also helps to refrain the influence of network topology and size/location of the disturbance. The test microgrid system considered is a modified Standard IEEE distribution network, which consists of radial feeders and distributed generations. Firstly, the proposed method is tested on a system with only synchronous generations to assess the accuracy of the estimate. This is followed by the integration of Type 3 and Type 4 wind turbines, and a PV array within the microgrid system. Virtual inertia control is then implemented in the wind turbines to obtain inertial support. Estimation study of the microgrid system with virtual inertia is then carried out. The developed estimation method can accurately estimate the inertia provided by the synchronous sources within the generation mix. Finally, from all the results and observations, the inertia estimation process in a microgrid system is segregated into synchronous and nonsynchronous inertia estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","publicationDate":"July 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876680/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2020","accessionNumber":"19709910","volume":"11","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measurement-Based Estimation of Inertia in AC Microgrids","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Smart Tools for intelligent Operation of Renewable Energy integrated power System","grantNumber":"IMPRINT-2A and IMP/2018/002009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement-Based Estimation of Inertia in AC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tste-rather-2948224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075536S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"9121590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"9121590","articleId":"8876680","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8876681,"authors":[{"name":"Yushu Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8833568/8876681/zhang-2947872-small.gif","p":["Yushu Zhang (M\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in December 2014.

However, in some special cases, many face recognition calculations cannot be performed effectively due to the lack of sufficient computing power of the terminal, which poses a challenge to the practical application of face recognition technology. Cloud computing provides a good platform for solving this problem due to its abundant computing resources. However, cloud computing poses new challenges, such as how to protect clients' data privacy without reducing efficiency. In this paper, we review some of the results of previous research and analyze an outsourcing protocol for eigen decomposition and singular value decomposition. On this basis, we propose a secure and efficient outsourcing protocol for face recognition through principal component analysis. In the proposed protocol, information privacy is well protected, and computational resources are saved by means of conversions of the original image information. In addition, local verification is supported to cope with the laziness of the cloud. We show the feasibility and advancement of our protocol from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8833568/08876681.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2019.2947872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2019.2947872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8833568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure and Efficient Outsourcing of PCA-Based Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Face recognition","Protocols","Outsourcing","Principal component analysis","Computational modeling","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptographic protocols","data protection","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition","outsourcing","principal component analysis","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition technology","cloud computing","abundant computing resources","eigen decomposition","singular value decomposition","secure protocol","efficient outsourcing protocol","computational resources","secure outsourcing","PCA-based face recognition","client data privacy protection","principal component analysis","information privacy","original image information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computation outsourcing","data privacy","face recognition","cloud computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Secure and Efficient Outsourcing of PCA-Based Face Recognition","volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/8876681/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2020","accessionNumber":"19272848","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFB0802300"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology","grantNumber":"cqupt-mct-201901"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61425024, 61872176 and 61572006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure and Efficient Outsourcing of PCA-Based Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhang-2947872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167725S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8833568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8833568","articleId":"8876681","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876688,"authors":[{"name":"Lachlan E.

We show that, contrary to what is usually supposed, the sensitivity of such measurements is significantly dependent on sample thickness in the range of typical wafer thicknesses, due to the attenuation of the magnetic field with distance from the coil. Sample thickness, as well as any separation from the coil, should, therefore, be taken into account in system calibration in order to avoid systematic errors. We investigate the magnitude of this effect both experimentally and via analytical and finite-element modeling for a range of commercial photoconductance measurement systems with varying coil geometry. Finite-element modeling is used to identify the functional form of the attenuation in the regime of interest, and simple formulae are derived which allow the experimentalist to correct for sample thickness and lift-off. Close agreement is found between modeled and experimental attenuation behavior. Finite-element modeling is also used to evaluate the magnitude of skin effects, which are found to have a minor influence on the measured conductance for the most highly conductive samples, and to determine the lateral spatial variation of the coil sensitivity, which is important for lifetime imaging techniques where photoconductance measurements are used for calibration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8876688/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","accessionNumber":"19167922","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accounting for the Dependence of Coil Sensitivity on Sample Thickness and Lift-Off in Inductively Coupled Photoconductance Measurements","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005105","fundingName":"Australian Renewable Energy Agency","grantNumber":"RND017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accounting for the Dependence of Coil Sensitivity on Sample Thickness and Lift-Off in Inductively Coupled Photoconductance Measurements","sourcePdf":"jphotov-black-2942484-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070033S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5503869","isNumber":"8884772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503869","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8884772","articleId":"8876688","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8876691,"authors":[{"name":"Samundra Deep","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/9031610/8876691/deep-2948204-small.gif","p":["Samundra Deep received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering from NIT Surat, India, and the master\u2019s degree in computer science and technology from UESTC, Chengdu, China.

In order to assist them to live in a safer environment, the increasing cost of nursing care and the shortage of health-care workers urges the demand of home-based assisted living in recent times. Therefore, home-based health-care has become an active research domain, particularly the abnormal activities detection involving information and communications technologies. This survey paper highlights this kind of technologies that exist for human anomalous behavior detection. It also reviews and discusses the current research trends, their outcomes and effects in elderly care. Our study is mainly focused on dense sensing network based activities and anomaly detection, which are robust to environment change, non-intrusive, user-friendly in the sense that do not require the occupant to wear any devices. From our study, we observe that employing sensor fusion techniques could significantly increases the efficiency of dense sensing network. In addition, sensor fusion models ensure a high level of robustness and effectiveness compared to the traditional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/9031610/08876691.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2019.2948204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2019.2948204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9031610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Anomalous Behavior Detection for Elderly Care Using Dense-Sensing Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Senior citizens","Anomaly detection","Sensor fusion","Statistics","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["assisted living","geriatrics","health care","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","elderly care","gradual ageing society","elderly people","home-based health-care","information and communications technologies","human anomalous behavior detection","dense sensing network","sensor fusion models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","dense sensing","activity recognition","sensor fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Anomalous Behavior Detection for Elderly Care Using Dense-Sensing Networks","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8876691/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2020","accessionNumber":"19454284","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Government through the Research Training Program Scholarship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Anomalous Behavior Detection for Elderly Care Using Dense-Sensing Networks","sourcePdf":"comst-zheng-2948204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.206327S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"9031610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9031610","articleId":"8876691","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876694,"authors":[{"name":"Vidit Saxena","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden","Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8930661/8876694/saxen-2948324-small.gif","p":["Vidit Saxena received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communications engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in wireless communication from the Faculty of Engineering, Sweden, in 2014.

These UAV base station networks (UAVBSN) promise an unprecendented degree of freedom that can be exploited for spectral efficiency gains as well as optimal network utilization. However, the current literature lacks realistic radio and traffic models for UAVBSN deployment planning and for performance evaluation. In this paper, we propose flowlevel models (FLM) for realistically characterizing the UAVBSN performance in terms of a broad range of flow- and system-level metrics. Further, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that relies on the UAVBSN FLM for learning the optimal traffic-aware UAV trajectories. For a given user traffic density and starting UAV locations, our RL approach learns the optimal UAV trajectories offline that maximizes a cumulative performance metric. We then execute the learned UAV trajectories in a discrete event simulator to evaluate online UAVBSN performance. For M = 9 UAVs deployed in a simulated Downtown San Francisco model, where the UAV trajectories are defined by N = 20 discrete actions, our approach achieves approximately a three-fold increase in the average user throughput compared to the initial UAV placement, while simultaneously balancing traffic loads across the BSs.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2019.2948324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8930661/08876694.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2019.2948324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal UAV Base Station Trajectories Using Flow-Level Models for Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Optimal UAV Base Station Trajectories Using Flow-Level Models for Reinforcement Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876694/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19275814","htmlLink":"/document/8876694/","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001654","fundingName":"German Academic Exchange Service London"},{"fundingName":"Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004063","fundingName":"Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal UAV Base Station Trajectories Using Flow-Level Models for Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tccn-saxena-2948324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119614S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8930661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8930661","articleId":"8876694","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876700,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhou","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8962108/8876700/zhou-2947856-small.gif","p":["Hao Zhou received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2015.

A training protocol for joint estimation of transmit and receive beams is presented with a general frame structure consisting of an initial access sub-frame followed by data transmission sub-frames. During the initial subframe, APs and mobiles sweep through a set of beams and determine the best transmit and receive beams via a handshake. All pilot signals are narrowband (tones), and the mobiles are distinguished by their assigned pilot frequencies. Both non-coherent and coherent beam estimation methods based on, respectively, power detection and maximum likelihood (ML) are presented. To avoid exchanging information about beamforming vectors between APs and mobiles, a local maximum likelihood (LML) algorithm is also presented. An efficient fast Fourier transform implementation is proposed for ML and LML to achieve high-resolution. A system-level optimization is performed in which the frame length, training time, and training bandwidth are selected to maximize a rate objective taking into account blockage and mobility. Simulation results based on a realistic network topology are presented to compare the performance of different estimation methods and training codebooks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8962108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8962108/08876700.pdf","startPage":"2759","endPage":"2771","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Acquisition and Training in Millimeter Wave Networks With Narrowband Pilots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Beam Acquisition and Training in Millimeter Wave Networks With Narrowband Pilots","volume":"37","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8876700/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19348949","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Futurewei Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Acquisition and Training in Millimeter Wave Networks With Narrowband Pilots","sourcePdf":"jsac-zhou-2947856-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11225S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8962108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8962108","articleId":"8876700","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":8876702,"authors":[{"name":"Xueyuan Wang","affiliation":["Syracuse University, Syracuse, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8962108/8876702/wang-2947929-small.gif","p":["Xueyuan Wang received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA, in 2016, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Distinguishing features of mmWave communications, such as different path loss models for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) links and directional transmissions are taken into account. In the downlink phase, the association probability, and energy coverages of different tier UAVs and ground base stations (GBSs) are investigated. Moreover, we define a successful transmission probability to jointly present the energy and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverages and provide general expressions. In the uplink phase, we consider the scenario that each UAV receives information from its own cluster member UEs. We determine the Laplace transform of the interference components and characterize the uplink SINR coverage. In addition, we formulate the average uplink throughput, with the goal to identify the optimal time division multiplexing between the donwlink and uplink phases. Through numerical results we investigate the impact of key system parameters on the performance. We show that the network performance is improved when the cluster size becomes smaller. In addition, we analyze the optimal height of UAVs, optimal power splitting value and optimal time division multiplexing that maximizes the network performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8962108/08876702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8962108","startPage":"2832","endPage":"2850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage Analysis for Energy-Harvesting UAV-Assisted mmWave Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coverage Analysis for Energy-Harvesting UAV-Assisted mmWave Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19348944","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8876702/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1618615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage Analysis for Energy-Harvesting UAV-Assisted mmWave Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-wang-2947929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106459S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8962108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8962108","articleId":"8876702","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8876708,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Fu","affiliation":["College of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Space Information Network and Intelligent Information Fusion, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/9034528/8876708/fu-2948144-small.gif","p":["Shu Fu received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in June 2016, focusing on cooperative multipoint wireless network, QoS routing in wavelength division multiplexing network, and cross-network energy efficiency.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.

The computing servers across multiple DAPs can be virtualized to constitute a CC pool to flexibly allocate the computing resource. When the amount of received data from a DAP is accumulated to a certain length of one data block, blockchain computing will be implemented to generate a correct Nonce value meeting the threshold of hash value. After the correct Nonce has been generated, the data block will be transmitted and stored in cloud caches, where the hash value is written into blockchain to guarantee the security of data block. We maximize system energy efficiency defined by the overall power consumption per unit of throughput transmitted from DAPs to cloud caches. We formulate the system optimization model by considering the constraints of data delay to avoid data overflow in the system. In order to solve the optimization model for maximizing system energy efficiency, we employ a geometric programming method to obtain the optimal power and resource allocation in blockchain-based IoT. By extensive simulations, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed energy-efficiency-aware optimization mechanism in the blockchain-based IoT.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/9034528/08876708.pdf","startPage":"1603","endPage":"1612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9034528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Computing in Integrated Blockchain-Based Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Computing in Integrated Blockchain-Based Internet of Things","volume":"7","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2020","accessionNumber":"19449729","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8876708/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876708/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701054"},{"fundingName":"Academician Expert Workstation of Bitvalue Technology (Hunan) Company Ltd.","grantNumber":"2017RS3064"},{"fundingName":"Purple Mountain Laboratory: Networking, Communications and Security"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Computing in Integrated Blockchain-Based Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-fu-2948144-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099042S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"9034528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9034528","articleId":"8876708","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876709,"authors":[{"name":"Federica Aveta","affiliation":["University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, USA"],"firstName":"Federica","lastName":"Aveta","id":"37086194239"},{"name":"Hazem H.

Diverse optical multiple access control (O-MAC) techniques have proved to successfully support multi-user FSOC. However, to adaptively and automatically select the most fitting O-MAC technique or combination thereof for signal demodulation, the number of transmitting users should be known a priori at the receiver side. In this letter, a technique based on histogram peak detection and unsupervised machine learning (e.g., k-mean, k-medoid, hierarchical, and fuzzy clustering), is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for number of users detection. The proposed methodology relies on amplitude information of received signals. Results show that when multiple users\u2019 signals are received with equal amplitude, under-estimation of user number was observed; hence, a modified approach\u2014a weighted clustering\u2014was employed and experimentally validated. The work reported herein demonstrated the ability of the proposed methodology to simultaneously and accurately detect multiple transmitting users in real time and under severe atmospheric turbulence.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/8907556/08876709.pdf","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2019.2948299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2019.2948299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8907556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Number of Users Detection in Multi-Point FSOC Using Unsupervised Machine Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Histograms","Optical transmitters","Optical fibers","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free-space optics (FSO)","number of users","multi-user communication","machine learning (ML)","clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Number of Users Detection in Multi-Point FSOC Using Unsupervised Machine Learning","volume":"31","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/8876709/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Number of Users Detection in Multi-Point FSOC Using Unsupervised Machine Learning","sourcePdf":"lpt-aveta-2948299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054884S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"8907556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8907556","articleId":"8876709","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876711,"authors":[{"name":"Inho Park","affiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9076749/8876711/park-2942370-small.gif","p":["Inho Park (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the integrated M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.","His research interests include integrated power management system designs, high-voltage silicon-based power converter designs, low-power CMOS analog circuit designs, and energy-harvesting circuit designs."]},"firstName":"Inho","lastName":"Park","orcid":"0000-0003-2067-0557","id":"37086348310"},{"name":"Junyoung Maeng","affiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9076749/8876711/maeng-2942370-small.gif","p":["Junyoung Maeng (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Hongik University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2014.

An important characteristic of TENGs is their ac output voltage with different positive and negative peak voltages; thus, the proposed system separately harvests each half-wave (HW) with a dual-output rectifier for better extraction efficiency. Furthermore, given the similarity between the electrical models of piezoelectric transducers and TENGs, a root-mean-square MPP analysis is proposed with a fractional open-circuit voltage (FOCV) method according to each HW from the TENGs. The HV DI buck converter regulates two HVs from the TENGs for MPPT with a single inductor. The proposed HV protector prevents the breakdown of the power transistor due to HV stress. To regulate the two input voltages of the buck converter at each MPP, a synchronous pulse-skipping modulation technique is implemented in the system. The entire system is fabricated in a 180-nm BCDMOS process with an active area of 2.482 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

service dependability in high-speed railway (HSR) networks. However, the phenomenon that wireless losses caused by frequent handoffs or other non-congestion losses in HSR networks has a detrimental influence on the performance of MPTCP. In order to improve performance of MPTCP when Long-Term Evolution for Railway (LTE-R) and WiFi communication routes are aggregated in HSR networks, we present a novel congestion control scheme, i.e., RVeno in this letter. Simulation results clearly reveal RVeno outperform the existing MPTCP congestion control algorithms in terms of throughput.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2019.2948163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2019.2948163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8986767/08876713.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8986767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When High-Speed Railway Networks Meet Multipath TCP: Supporting Dependable Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"When High-Speed Railway Networks Meet Multipath TCP: Supporting Dependable Communications","volume":"9","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2020","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","accessionNumber":"19341702","htmlLink":"/document/8876713/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Haidian Joint Fund","grantNumber":"L172020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFE0200900"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61725101 and U1834210"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009592","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"Z181100003218010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61961130391"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety","grantNumber":"RCS2018ZZ007 and RCS2019ZZ007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When High-Speed Railway Networks Meet Multipath TCP: Supporting Dependable Communications","sourcePdf":"lwc-ai-2948163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057382S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8986767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8986767","articleId":"8876713","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876830,"authors":[{"name":"Junhui Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10209/8907372/8876830/zhao.a1-2935793-small.gif","p":["Junhui Zhao (junhuizhao@hotmail.com) is a professor with Beijing Jiaotong University.

Under the black-box condition, less information about parameters of the classification model, limited query times, and less feedback information available, it is difficult to generate adversarial examples against the black-box model. In order to further improve the efficiency of the adversarial images generation, we propose two different variants of Partial Swarm Optimization algorithm (vPSO) base on the traditional Partial Swarm Optimization for the targeted and non-targeted attack under conditions of the completely black-box. Compared with the existing of the state-of-the-art generation algorithm, the vPSO effectively reduce the number of queries to the black-box classifier and the dependence on the feedback information. The success rate of the targeted attack is up to 96.0% and the average number of queries for the black-box model is greatly reduced. Furthermore, we propose an efficient target image screening method in targeted attacks, as well as the concept of easy-to-attack and hard-to-attack images in non-targeted attacks, and give corresponding distinctions.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948146","startPage":"158051","endPage":"158063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08876844.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attacking Black-Box Image Classifiers With Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Particle swarm optimization","Neural networks","Standards","Training","Security","Perturbation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target image screening method","hard-to-attack images","targeted attack","black-box classifier","adversarial images generation","black-box model","limited query times","black-box condition","adversarial examples generation","classification model","neural network classification performance","deep neural networks","particle swarm optimization","black-box image classifiers","nontargeted attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","variants of PSO (vPSO)","deep neural network","images classifiers","black-box attack"]}],"topic":"Security and Privacy in Emerging Decentralized Communication Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Attacking Black-Box Image Classifiers With Particle Swarm Optimization","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8876844/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"19124371","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61876019 and 61772070"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Attacking Black-Box Image Classifiers With Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-hu-2948146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106164S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Security and Privacy in Emerging Decentralized Communication Environments"],"articleId":"8876844","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8876848,"authors":[{"name":"Milad Tatar Mamaghani","affiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8876848/mamag-2948384-small.gif","p":["Milad Tatar Mamaghani received the B.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering and communications and control from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

We adopt destination-assisted cooperative jamming as well as simultaneous wireless information and power transfer at the UAV-mounted relay to enhance physical-layer security and transmission reliability. Assuming a low-altitude UAV, we derive connection probability, secrecy outage probability, instantaneous secrecy rate, and average secrecy rate of the proposed protocol over Air-Ground channels, which are modeled as Rician fading with elevation-angel dependent parameters. Further, we analyze the asymptotic average secrecy rate performance of the proposed UAV-relaying scheme and derive high signal-to-noise ratio measures of the average secrecy rate to highlight the effect of various channel features on the system performance. By simulations, we verify our novel theoretical exact and approximate results and demonstrate significant performance improvement of our protocol, when compared to conventional transmission protocol with ground relaying and UAV-based transmission protocol without exploiting destination jamming. Finally, we evaluate the impacts of various system parameters, specifically, find the optimal UAV placement on the proposed protocol in terms of the aforementioned secrecy metrics.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08876848.pdf","startPage":"153060","endPage":"153073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Low-Altitude UAV-Enabled Secure AF Relaying With Cooperative Jamming and SWIPT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Low-Altitude UAV-Enabled Secure AF Relaying With Cooperative Jamming and SWIPT","volume":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876848/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087265","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876848/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP160100528"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Performance of Low-Altitude UAV-Enabled Secure AF Relaying With Cooperative Jamming and SWIPT","sourcePdf":"access-tatarmamaghani-2948384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.230856S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8876848","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876849,"authors":[{"name":"Zehui Chen","affiliation":["University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8960485/8876849/chen-2948332-small.gif","p":["Zehui Chen (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree (cum laude) in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, in 2016, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2018.

In a crossbar ReRAM, in which a memristor is positioned on each row-column intersection, the sneak-path problem is one of the main challenges for a reliable readout. The sneak-path problem can be solved with additional selection devices. When some selection devices fail short, the sneak-path problem re-occurs. The re-occurred sneak-path problem is addressed in this paper. The re-occurred sneak-path event can be described combinatorially and its adverse effect can be modeled as a parallel interference. Based on a simple pilot construction, we probabilistically characterize the inter-cell dependency of the re-occurred sneak-path events. Utilizing this dependency, we propose adaptive thresholding schemes for resistive memory readout using side information provided by pilot cells. This estimation theoretic approach effectively reduces the bit-error rate while maintaining low redundancy overhead and low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2948332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2948332","startPage":"66","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

livers and liver tumors is one of the most important steps in radiation therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. The segmentation task is often done manually, making it tedious, labor intensive, and subject to intra-/inter- operator variations. While various algorithms for delineating organ-at-risks (OARs) and tumor targets have been proposed, automatic segmentation of livers and liver tumors remains intractable due to their low tissue contrast with respect to the surrounding organs and their deformable shape in CT images. The U-Net has gained increasing popularity recently for image analysis tasks and has shown promising results. Conventional U-Net architectures, however, suffer from three major drawbacks. First, skip connections allow for the duplicated transfer of low resolution information in feature maps to improve efficiency in learning, but this often leads to blurring of extracted image features. Secondly, high level features extracted by the network often do not contain enough high resolution edge information of the input, leading to greater uncertainty where high resolution edge dominantly affects the network's decisions such as liver and liver-tumor segmentation. Thirdly, it is generally difficult to optimize the number of pooling operations in order to extract high level global features, since the number of pooling operations used depends on the object size. To cope with these problems, we added a residual path with deconvolution and activation operations to the skip connection of the U-Net to avoid duplication of low resolution information of features. In the case of small object inputs, features in the skip connection are not incorporated with features in the residual path. Furthermore, the proposed architecture has additional convolution layers in the skip connection in order to extract high level global features of small object inputs as well as high level features of high resolution edge information of large object inputs. Efficacy of the modified U-Net (mU-Net) was demonstrated using the public dataset of Liver tumor segmentation (LiTS) challenge 2017. For liver-tumor segmentation, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.72 %, volume of error (VOE) of 21.93 %, and relative volume difference (RVD) of - 0.49 % were obtained. For liver segmentation, DSC of 98.51 %, VOE of 3.07 %, and RVD of 0.26 % were calculated. For the public 3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database (3Dircadb), DSCs were 96.01 % for the liver and 68.14 % for liver-tumor segmentations, respectively. The proposed mU-Net outperformed existing state-of-art networks.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2019.2948320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/9084068/08876857.pdf","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2948320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9084068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified U-Net (mU-Net) With Incorporation of Object-Dependent High Level Features for Improved Liver and Liver-Tumor Segmentation in CT Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876857/","displayDocTitle":"Modified U-Net (mU-Net) With Incorporation of Object-Dependent High Level Features for Improved Liver and Liver-Tumor Segmentation in CT Images","volume":"39","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2020","accessionNumber":"19683270","pubMedId":"31634827","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876857/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH/NCI, Varian Medical Systems","grantNumber":"1R01 CA176553"},{"fundingName":"Huiyihuiying Medical Company"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006785","fundingName":"Faculty Research Award from Google Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified U-Net (mU-Net) With Incorporation of Object-Dependent High Level Features for Improved Liver and Liver-Tumor Segmentation in CT Images","sourcePdf":"tmi-seo-2948320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088731S","chronDate":"May  2020","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"9084068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"9084068","articleId":"8876857","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876866,"authors":[{"name":"Vishnu Mahadeva Iyer","affiliation":["NSF FREEDM Systems Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/9123771/8876866/iyer-2945264-small.gif","p":["Vishnu Mahadeva Iyer (S\u201916) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the College of Engineering, Trivandrum, Trivandrum, India, in 2011, and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, Bengaluru, India, in 2013.

A cascaded H-bridge converter is utilized to directly interface with the medium voltage grid while dual-active-bridge based soft-switched solid-state transformers are used to achieve galvanic isolation. The proposed approach eliminates redundant power conversion by making use of partial power rated dc-dc converters to charge the individual EVs. Partial power processing enables independent charging control over each EV, while processing only a fraction of the total battery charging power. Practical implementation schemes for the partial power charger unit are analyzed. A phase-shifted full-bridge converter-based charger is proposed. Design and control considerations for enabling multiple charging points are elucidated. Experimental results from a down-scaled laboratory test-bed are provided to validate the control aspects, functionality, and effectiveness of the proposed XFC station power delivery scheme. With a down-scaled partial power converter that is rated to handle only 27% of the battery power, an efficiency improvement of 0.6% at full-load and 1.6% at 50% load is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2019.2945264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/9123771/08876866.pdf","startPage":"8076","endPage":"8087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9123771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2019.2945264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach Towards Extreme Fast Charging Station Power Delivery for Electric Vehicles with Partial Power Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2020","displayDocTitle":"An Approach Towards Extreme Fast Charging Station Power Delivery for Electric Vehicles with Partial Power Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876866/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19727972","htmlLink":"/document/8876866/","volume":"67","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Approach Towards Extreme Fast Charging Station Power Delivery for Electric Vehicles with Partial Power Processing","sourcePdf":"tie-mahadevaiyer-2945264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107346S","chronDate":"Oct.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"9123771","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"9123771","articleId":"8876866","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876867,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Li","affiliation":["Network Intelligence and Innovation Laboratory, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8876867/li-2947046-small.gif","p":["Gang Li received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from the Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in information and communication systems from the Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China, in 2016.

Different from most existing work in the literature that was based on offline settings, in this paper, an online truthful mechanism integrating computation and communication resource allocation is proposed. In our system model, upon the arrival of a smartphone user who requests task offloading, the base station (BS) needs to make a decision right away without knowing any future information on i) whether to accept or reject this task offloading request and ii) if accepted, who to execute the task (the BS itself or nearby smartphone users called collaborators). By considering each task's specific requirements in terms of data size, delay, and preference, we formulate a social-welfare-maximization problem, which integrates collaborator selection, communication and computation resource allocation, transmission and computation time scheduling, as well as pricing policy design. To solve this complicated problem, a novel online mechanism is proposed based on the primal-dual optimization framework. Theoretical analyses show that our mechanism can guarantee feasibility, truthfulness, and computational efficiency (competitive ratio of 3). We further use comprehensive simulations to validate our analyses and the properties of our proposed mechanism.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876867","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Collaboration","Resource management","Servers","Computational modeling","Optimization","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","optimisation","resource allocation","scheduling","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online incentive mechanism","collaborative task offloading","mobile edge computing","incentive mechanism design","communication resource allocation","smartphone user","base station","BS","task offloading request","collaborator selection","computation resource allocation","computation time scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MEC","collaborative offloading","online mechanism design","social welfare maximization"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08876867.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2947046","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2947046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Online Incentive Mechanism for Collaborative Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876867/","displayDocTitle":"An Online Incentive Mechanism for Collaborative Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19262647","htmlLink":"/document/8876867/","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Online Incentive Mechanism for Collaborative Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing","sourcePdf":"twc-cai-2947046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119665S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8876867","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876869,"authors":[{"name":"Zolboo Byambadorj","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8952842/8876869/byamb-2938964-small.gif","p":["Zolboo Byambadorj (S\u201918) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in communication engineering from the National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

However, it is challenging to run computation-intensive DNN-based tasks on mobile devices due to the limited computation resources. What's worse, traditional cloud-assisted DNN inference is heavily hindered by the significant wide-area network latency, leading to poor real-time performance as well as low quality of user experience. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Edgent, a framework that leverages edge computing for DNN collaborative inference through device-edge synergy. Edgent exploits two design knobs: (1) DNN partitioning that adaptively partitions computation between device and edge for purpose of coordinating the powerful cloud resource and the proximal edge resource for real-time DNN inference; (2) DNN right-sizing that further reduces computing latency via early exiting inference at an appropriate intermediate DNN layer. In addition, considering the potential network fluctuation in real-world deployment, Edgent is properly design to specialize for both static and dynamic network environment. Specifically, in a static environment where the bandwidth changes slowly, Edgent derives the best configurations with the assist of regression-based prediction models, while in a dynamic environment where the bandwidth varies dramatically, Edgent generates the best execution plan through the online change point detection algorithm that maps the current bandwidth state to the optimal configuration. We implement Edgent prototype based on the Raspberry Pi and the desktop PC and the extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate Edgent's effectiveness in enabling on-demand low-latency edge intelligence.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2946140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08876870.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2946140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge AI: On-Demand Accelerating Deep Neural Network Inference via Edge Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Edge AI: On-Demand Accelerating Deep Neural Network Inference via Edge Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876870/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19262612","htmlLink":"/document/8876870/","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1711265, 61972432 and 61802449"},{"fundingName":"Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X355"},{"fundingName":"Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program","grantNumber":"2017GC010465"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds","grantNumber":"2018A030313032"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"17lgjc40"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge AI: On-Demand Accelerating Deep Neural Network Inference via Edge Computing","sourcePdf":"twc-chen-2946140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136564S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8876870","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876871,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Bruni","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8952842/8876871/bruni-2945179-small.gif","p":["Giovanni Bruni (S\u201911) received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2014 and the M.S. degree in physics from the Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 2018, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in physics.","His current research interests include detector development, data acquisition systems, radiation effects on digital circuits, FPGA development, and data analysis of nuclear physics experiments."]},"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Bruni","orcid":"0000-0003-4858-4212","id":"37087233921"},{"name":"H\u00e5kan T.

This work presents a configuration-free lossless compression algorithm, which addresses both limitations, by compressing the data on-the-fly in the controlling FPGA. Thus it can easily be used directly in front-end electronics. The method first computes the differences between consecutive samples in the traces, thereby concentrating the most probable values around zero. The values are then stored as groups of four, with only the necessary least-significant bits in a variable-length code, packed in a stream of 32-bit words. To evaluate the efficiency, the storage cost of compressed traces is modeled as a baseline cost including ADC noise, and a cost for pulses that depends on amplitude and width. The free parameters and the validity of the model are determined by compressing artificial traces with varying characteristics. The compression method was also applied to actual data from different types of detectors. A typical storage cost is around 4 to 5 bits per sample. Code for the FPGA implementation in VHDL and for the CPU decompression routine in C are available as open source software, both able to operate at speeds of 400 Msamples/s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"67","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19265583","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8876871/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DPTC\u2014An FPGA-Based Trace Compression","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det","grantNumber":"2017-03839"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det","grantNumber":"822-2014-6644"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"DPTC\u2014An FPGA-Based Trace Compression","sourcePdf":"tcsi-johansson-2945179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090882S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8952842","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"8952842","articleId":"8876871","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876874,"authors":[{"name":"Luca De Vito","affiliation":["University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9058726/8876874/vito-2947986-small.gif","p":["Luca De Vito (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201912) received the master\u2019s degree (cum laude) in software engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He joined the research activities carried out at the Laboratory of Signal Processing and Measurement Information, University of Sannio.

By exploiting compressive sampling, the method allows using analog-to-digital converters with a sampling frequency much lower than the symbol rate of the transmitted bit stream. Moreover, it does not need a properly generated signal, as it happens in time-domain reflectometry; however, any signal having a pulse-amplitude modulation, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), or spread spectrum modulation can be used. Therefore, the transceiver actually used for data transmission can also be used to generate test signals for the channel estimation and the measurement instrument can be integrated into the data communication equipment without requiring additional generators. The mathematical formulation of the method is presented, together with its evaluation by numerical simulations and experimental tests.

However, the conventional Lyapunov theory-based design is not always suitable to analyze the quantitative behavior of closed-loop system. This article presents a time-scale redesign-based saturated tracking controller for a class of feedback linearizable multi-input\u2013multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. The proposed controller is built upon the frameworks of contraction and partial contraction theories which ensures that bounded tracking performance as well as quantify the steady-state error bounds in terms of the various control design parameters. Notably, in contrast to the existing Lyapunov-method-based designs, the proposed approach allows to tune the controller performance without arbitrary reduction of singular perturbation parameters. Therefore, the vulnerability of the controller toward actuator saturation and noise, due to the ill-effects of high-gains stemming from the conventional high-gain controllers, are reduced. The extensive experimental results using a wheeled mobile robot are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/9488261/08876875.pdf","startPage":"4681","endPage":"4692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2019.2945841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2019.2945841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9488261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Scale Redesign-Based Saturated Controller Synthesis for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Trajectory","MIMO communication","Actuators","Closed loop systems","Perturbation methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contraction theory","mobile robot","partial contraction","singular perturbation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Time-Scale Redesign-Based Saturated Controller Synthesis for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems","volume":"51","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8876875/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Scale Redesign-Based Saturated Controller Synthesis for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmc-rayguru-2945841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181549S","chronDate":"Aug.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9488261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9488261","articleId":"8876875","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876876,"authors":[{"name":"Liyuan Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8960485/8876876/song-2948341-small.gif","p":["Liyuan Song received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Beiyou University (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2014.

A base station equipped with a single-antenna, with multiple antennas, and with massive antenna arrays is considered both in single-cell and multi-cell deployments. In particular, in single-antenna systems, we identify two types of gains brought about by NOMA: 1) a large-scale near-far gain arising from the distance discrepancy between the base station and users; 2) a small-scale fading gain originating from the multipath channel fading. Furthermore, we reveal that the large-scale near-far gain increases with the normalized cell size, while the small-scale fading gain is a constant, given by \u03b3 = 0.57721 nat/s/Hz, in Rayleigh fading channels. When extending single-antenna NOMA to M-antenna NOMA, we prove that both the large-scale near-far gain and small-scale fading gain achieved by single-antenna NOMA can be increased by a factor of M for a large number of users. Moreover, given a massive antenna array at the base station and considering a fixed ratio between the number of antennas, M, and the number of users, K, the ESG of NOMA over OMA increases linearly with both M and K. We then further extend the analysis to a multi-cell scenario. Compared to the single-cell case, the ESG in multi-cell systems degrades as NOMA faces more severe inter-cell interference due to the non-orthogonal transmissions. Besides, we unveil that a large cell size is always beneficial to the ergodic sum-rate performance of NOMA in both single-cell and multi-cell systems. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the analytical results derived and confirm the insights revealed about the ESG of NOMA over OMA in different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2948343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8960485/08876877.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8960485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2948343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance Gain of NOMA Over OMA in Uplink Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance Gain of NOMA Over OMA in Uplink Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876877/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19266615","htmlLink":"/document/8876877/","volume":"68","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP190101363"},{"fundingName":"Linkage Projects","grantNumber":"LP160100708 and LP170101196"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971403"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"CSU-QZKT-2018-16"},{"fundingName":"UNSW Digital Grid Futures Institute, UNSW, Sydney, under a cross-disciplinary fund scheme and by the Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Early Career Researcher Award","grantNumber":"DE170100137"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/PO34284/1"},{"fundingName":"COALESCE, of the Royal Society\u2019s Global Challenges Research Fund Grant as well as of the European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance Gain of NOMA Over OMA in Uplink Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yuan-2948343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.220258S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8960485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8960485","articleId":"8876877","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876878,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8960485/8876878/wang-2948340-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang (S\u201915\u2013M\u201918) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2017.

In this paper, we design a beam-switching based spatial modulation for mmWave MIMO uplink systems. At user side, a power iteration based algorithm is proposed to generate spatial symbols under the constant modulus constraint. With the generated spatial codebook, the optimal transmission mode is determined. At base station side, a round-robin path selection algorithm is proposed to select paths that are separated in angle of arrival. Inter-user interference is then suppressed by constraining the power of the received spatial symbols over selected paths only. Finally, ordered successive interference cancelation is applied to further reduce interference among users. Numerical results show that the proposed beam-switching based spatial modulation is superior to transmission over the strongest propagation path and is able to yield a satisfactory error performance in mmWave MIMO uplink.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2948340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8960485/08876878.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8960485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2948340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Modulation for Uplink Multi-User mmWave MIMO Systems With Hybrid Structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Modulation for Uplink Multi-User mmWave MIMO Systems With Hybrid Structure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876878/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19266604","htmlLink":"/document/8876878/","volume":"68","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"LP160100672 and LP160101244"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Modulation for Uplink Multi-User mmWave MIMO Systems With Hybrid Structure","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2948340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197741S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8960485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8960485","articleId":"8876878","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876880,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Ciprut","affiliation":["University of Rochester, Rochester, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8964612/8876880/cipru-2941967-small.gif","p":["Albert Ciprut (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2013, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA, in 2016 and 2019, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. E.

Integrating these regulators into a highly resistive environment has complicated the design of power delivery systems. With the increasing sensitivity of complex integrated systems to power noise, effective approaches to distribute on-chip LDOs are needed due to the limited metal resources. In this article, a methodology is proposed to distribute the pass gates of a system of on-chip digital LDOs. The distribution of the pass gates considers the location of the load currents to reduce voltage variations across the power grid. The proposed pass gate distribution topology reduces the maximum voltage variations across the grid, on average, by two to three times under nonuniform load distributions.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2941967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8964612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2941967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8964612/08876880.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Pass Gates in Power Delivery Systems With Digital Low-Dropout Regulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Pass Gates in Power Delivery Systems With Digital Low-Dropout Regulators","volume":"28","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876880/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","accessionNumber":"19283380","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876880/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1526466 and CCF-1716091"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011039","fundingName":"Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity","grantNumber":"W911NF-14-C-0089"},{"fundingName":"AIM Photonics","grantNumber":"059447-007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011101","fundingName":"Intel Collaboration Research Institute for Computational Intelligence"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004351","fundingName":"Cisco Systems"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005144","fundingName":"Qualcomm"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Pass Gates in Power Delivery Systems With Digital Low-Dropout Regulators","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ciprut-2941967-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064826S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8964612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"8964612","articleId":"8876880","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8876883,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Biereigel","affiliation":["ESAT-ADVISE Research Lab, KU Leuven University, Leuven, Belgium","CERN, Geneva, Switzerland","European Organization for Nuclear Research, Switzerland and Electronics and Sensor Systems, Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9080045/8876883/biere-2944791-small.gif","p":["Stefan Biereigel was born in Gera, Germany, in 1994.

In our SM/MC-SCDMA system, the advantages of both MC signalling and SM are amalgamated to conceive a low-complexity transceiver. Sparse frequency-domain spreading is utilized to mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of MC signalling, as well as to facilitate low-complexity detection using the message passing algorithm. We then analyze the single-user bit error rate performance of SM/MC-SCDMA systems communicating over frequency-selective fading channels. Furthermore, the performance of SM/MC-SCDMA systems is evaluated based on both Monte-Carlo simulations and analytical results. We demonstrate that our low-complexity SM/MC-SCDMA transceivers are capable of achieving near-maximum likelihood (ML) performance even when the normalized user-load is as high as two, hence constituting a variable solution to support massive connectivity in device-centric wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2947042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08876885.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2947042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Modulated Multicarrier Sparse Code-Division Multiple Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876885/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Modulated Multicarrier Sparse Code-Division Multiple Access","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19262619","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876885/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P034284/1 and EP/P03456X/1"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s (ERC\u2019s) Advance Fellow Award QuantCom"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC under the Established Career Fellowship","grantNumber":"EP/R007101/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001320","fundingName":"Wolfson Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Modulated Multicarrier Sparse Code-Division Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"twc-hanzo-2947042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159423S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8876885","onlineDate":"18 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876916,"authors":[{"name":"Shahbaz Hassan","affiliation":["Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shahbaz","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37086803523"},{"name":"Ayesha Irfan","affiliation":["Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ayesha","lastName":"Irfan","id":"37087045644"},{"name":"Ali Mirza","affiliation":["Bahria University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Mirza","id":"37085654988"},{"name":"Imran Siddiqi","affiliation":["Bahria University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Imran","lastName":"Siddiqi","id":"37949353600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2914-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2915-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8876916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876916","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Text recognition","Feature extraction","Character recognition","Databases","Shape","Writing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","handwriting recognition","handwritten character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cursive handwritten text recognition","bi-directional LSTM","Urdu handwriting","context sensitive character shapes","intra word spacings","low inter class variation","cursive scripts","implicit character segmentation","bi-directional long-short-term memory","handwritten text lines","character recognition rates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cursive Text","Handwriting Recognition","CNNs","LSTMs"]}],"abstract":"Recognition of cursive handwritten text is a complex problem due challenges like context sensitive character shapes, non-uniform inter and intra word spacings, complex positioning of dots and diacritics and very low inter class variation among certain classes.

For this purpose, in this paper, we investigate the ways to improve the efficiency of the energy used by these buildings.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep learning approach for waste detection and classification in food trays. The proposed two-step approach retains the advantages of recent object detectors (as Faster R-CNN) and allows the classification task to be supported in higher resolution bounding boxes. Additionally, we also collect, annotate and make available to the scientific community a new dataset, named Labeled Waste in the Wild, for research and benchmark purposes.

It is caused by a pathogenic fungi that attacks the underside of coffee leaves and it is characterized by the presence of yellow-orange and powdery points. If not treated, rust can cause a drop in coffee production of up to 45%. In this sense, this paper presents a contribution to the problem of rust identification that doesn't use \u201chandcrafted\u201d features, i.e., features extracted according to rules established by human programmers.

We evaluated our CNN in a set of images provided by an expert and comparison results show that our approach is able to to detect the infection with a high precision, as corroborated by the high Dice coefficient obtained.","doi":"10.1109/WVC.2019.8876931","publicationTitle":"2019 XV Workshop de Vis\u00e3o Computacional (WVC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 XV Workshop de Vis\u00e3o Computacional (WVC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869702/8876909/08876931.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WVC.2019.8876931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coffee Leaf Rust Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Coffee Leaf Rust Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network","htmlLink":"/document/8876931/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080480","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coffee Leaf Rust Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102952S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8869702","isNumber":"8876909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869702","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8876909","articleId":"8876931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876932,"authors":[{"name":"Bet\u00fcl Ay","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bet\u00fcl","lastName":"Ay","id":"37086598862"},{"name":"Galip Ayd\u0131n","affiliation":["Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Galip","lastName":"Ayd\u0131n","id":"37297729000"},{"name":"Zeynep Koyun","affiliation":["IT R&D Department, FLO Magazacilik A.S., Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Zeynep","lastName":"Koyun","id":"37087054526"},{"name":"Mehmet Demir","affiliation":["Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Demir","id":"37087053014"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2914-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2915-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8876932","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876932","abstract":"The goal of content-based recommendation system is to retrieve and rank the list of items that are closest to the query item.

The main goal is to detect facial makeup using the CMYK color model, and analyzing its results by comparing it to the HSV color model, which is widely used in the literature. In the detection process, each image was separated into regions of interest (the eyes and the whole face). Five image databases were chosen, all varying in lighting and environment conditions. In HSV, 91% of accuracy was achieved on the eye region and 92% on the face. In CMYK, the results obtained had 97% of accuracy on the eye region and 95% on the face. Therefore, based on the results achieved, the CMYK color model, even though it is mainly used in Printing, deserves attention in the area of Computer Vision, involving Makeup Detection.","doi":"10.1109/WVC.2019.8876943","startPage":"54","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"2019 XV Workshop de Vis\u00e3o Computacional (WVC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WVC.2019.8876943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876909","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 XV Workshop de Vis\u00e3o Computacional (WVC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869702/8876909/08876943.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Makeup Detection using the CMYK Color Model and Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876943/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Facial Makeup Detection using the CMYK Color Model and Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8876943/","accessionNumber":"19080482","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial Makeup Detection using the CMYK Color Model and Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052169S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8869702","isNumber":"8876909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869702","xplore-issue":"8876909","articleId":"8876943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8876949,"authors":[{"name":"Halil Can Kaskavalci","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering, Yeditepe University Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Halil Can","lastName":"Kaskavalci","id":"37087049752"},{"name":"Sezer G\u00f6ren","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering, Yeditepe University Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sezer","lastName":"G\u00f6ren","id":"37338239000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2914-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2915-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8876949","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Face recognition","Face","Cameras","Servers","Bandwidth","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","storage management","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["storage device","hard drive","Internet connection","bandwidth requirements","cloud cost","deep learning","scalable surveillance architecture","distributed smart surveillance architecture","video footage recording","edge computing","cloud computing","footage processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surveillance, Edge computing, Cloud computing, Internet of things, Deep learning, Smart gateway"]}],"abstract":"Smart surveillance is getting increasingly popular as technologies become easier to use and cheaper.

Unfortunately, only a handful of these tools support out-of-the-box integration with the IoT. In this work, we discuss the different design and implementation decisions for enabling existing actor-oriented MDSD tools for the IoT. Moreover, we propose an integration approach based on the use of proxy actors and system interfaces. The approach offers seamless and flexible integration of external IoT devices into the user's model. We implement and evaluate our approach using the MDSD tool Papyrus for Realtime as a testbed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Internet of Things","Unified modeling language","Tools","Object oriented modeling","Runtime","Publish-subscribe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","software architecture","software engineering","software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things applications","software development process","MDSD frameworks","IoT applications","realtime systems","proxy actors","system interfaces","external IoT devices","MDSD tool Papyrus","model-driven software development tools","actor-oriented MDSD tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-Driven Development","Internet of Things","UML-RT","Actors","Papyrus-RT"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MiSE.2019.00022","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE/ACM 11th International Workshop on Modelling in Software Engineering (MiSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE/ACM 11th International Workshop on Modelling in Software Engineering (MiSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8870905/8876960/08876986.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MiSE.2019.00022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Model-Driven Software Development Tools for the Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Model-Driven Software Development Tools for the Internet of Things","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8876986/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8876986/","accessionNumber":"19080523","conferenceDate":"26-27 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 May 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Model-Driven Software Development Tools for the Internet of Things","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"223100a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103609S","chronDate":"26-27 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8870905","isNumber":"8876960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8870905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8876960","articleId":"8876986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8876987,"authors":[{"name":"Evelina Pencheva","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Evelina","lastName":"Pencheva","id":"37568448100"},{"name":"Ivaylo Atanasov","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Ivaylo","lastName":"Atanasov","id":"37568448300"},{"name":"Denitsa Velkova","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Denitsa","lastName":"Velkova","id":"37086834799"},{"name":"Ventsislav Trifonov","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Ventsislav","lastName":"Trifonov","id":"37086030950"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9325-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9324-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9326-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8876987","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Multi-access Edge Computing Deployment Scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8876987","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","distributed processing","mobility management (mobile radio)","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiaccess edge computing","centralized radio access network","fifth generation mobile networks","radio resource management functionality","MEC potential","session management procedures","mobility management","signaling reduction","C-RAN deployment scenarios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge computing","Centralized Radio Access network","Mobility Management","Session management","Latency"]}],"abstract":"Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) appear to be key and complementary technologies for fifth generation mobile networks.

MANETs predominantly deploy Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm to develop routes reactively. AODV deploys the destination sequence number by which it provides loop-free routes. In this paper, the hardware architecture for the functionality of the route discovery process utilized in AODV routing protocol is modeled and implemented using Verilog hardware description language and synthesized in XC4VLX25 device. Moreover, some parameter constants have also been taken into consideration to implement a route discovery mechanism for the real-time scenario. The implemented results show that the proposed architecture offers good performance in terms of area, speed and power dissipation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 9th Annual Information Technology,

However, mmWave, e.g., 60 GHz (WiGig) links are very susceptible to obstacles blocking, due to high propagation loss and penetration loss. Device to device (D2D) relaying is considered as an effective approaches to deal with the blockage problem in mmWave communication. In this paper we propose a novel fuzzy logic based relay selection scheme for the mmWave network. For the relay selection scheme if the mmWave link blocked between the access point (AP) and the mobile node is detected, a fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used to select the best relay among the AP's neighbors based on three metrics: achievable data rate, the mobile node speed and battery level. As the relay node is selected, the AP will start beamforming training for constructing the high data rate mmWave link with the chosen mobile node through a relay node. As the proposed scheme combines between the most three important metrics in network, the simulation analysis confirms the superiority of the proposed scheme over the conventional scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19080474","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Logic based Relay Selection for MmWave Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Logic based Relay Selection for MmWave Communications","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"3_1570519577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054682S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2019","isNumber":"8876955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869701","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8877074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877086,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Fahem Albaghdadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Basrah, Basrah, Iraq"],"firstName":"Ahmed Fahem","lastName":"Albaghdadi","id":"37087049531"},{"name":"Abduladhem Abdulkareem Ali","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Basrah, Basrah, Iraq"],"firstName":"Abduladhem Abdulkareem","lastName":"Ali","id":"38060846200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9325-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9324-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9326-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8877086","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877086","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","genetic algorithms","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["straight line path","collision-free path","fixed environments","mobile environments","genetic algorithm","potential field algorithm","multiple mobile robots","3D path planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D potential field","Fix environment","mobile robots","smooth path","path planning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMECONX.2019.8877086","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869701/8876955/08877086.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 9th Annual Information Technology, Electromechanical Engineering and Microelectronics Conference (IEMECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 9th Annual Information Technology, Electromechanical Engineering and Microelectronics Conference (IEMECON)","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMECONX.2019.8877086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Path planning of fixed and mobile environments using potential field algorithm with Genetic algorithm","abstract":"Path planning is one of the most important techniques responsible for drawing a collision-free path for each robot in a crowded environment. Potential field algorithm is one of most fame algorithms of path planning, it works online. The potential field algorithm deals with any robot as an electron in a potential field. This robot or electron attract to the goal location and repulsion from other robots and obstacles. These forces cause it to move naturally to the target point with a suboptimal path. In this paper, we study and simulate multi scenarios of potential field algorithm in both cases which are: static and dynamic 3D environments. In the static environment, we suppose many static obstacles in random positions then find suboptimal path according to this algorithm. The second scenarios based on the existence of multiple mobile robots. The straight line path of each robot collides at least with the one other path.

Spectrum sensing involves classification of a part of spectrum or a frequency band as either \u201coccupied\u201d or \u201cunoccupied\u201d. A secondary user is permitted to transmit in this frequency band only if it is \u201cunoccupied\u201d. Conventional method for spectrum sensing involves checking the energy of received signal against a threshold. Such a method for classification of spectrum sensing may not be efficient when the decision region between \u201coccupied\u201d class and \u201cunoccupied\u201d class is nonlinear. In this paper, we propose to implement such a nonlinear classifier using support vector machine (SVM). Since, cognitive radio measurements involve large dataset, application of SVM is difficult for spectrum sensing. To overcome this difficulty, we apply a new fast learning algorithm (FLA-SVM) proposed in the literature to this problem. Application of FLA-SVM results in sample points reduced to $1/4^{th} \\sim 1/5^{th}$, even to $1/10^{th}$ of initial training samples. Using these final samples, the training time gets reduced considerably and training speed increases to a remarkable extent. The most significant aspect is that the accuracy of classification can be kept similar as when a large set of training samples is applied to train the SVM. The simulation result shows the FLA to be extremely effective for spectrum sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877089/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19080434","publicationDate":"March 2019","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Spectrum Classification using FLA-SVM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Spectrum Classification using FLA-SVM","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"3_1570516351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037886S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2019","isNumber":"8876955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869701","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8877089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8877102,"authors":[{"name":"Shah Zeb","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shah","lastName":"Zeb","id":"37086356576"},{"name":"Qamar Abbas","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Pakistan"],"firstName":"Qamar","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37087048419"},{"name":"Syed Ali Hassan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Ali","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37410456900"},{"name":"Aamir Mahmood","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems & Technology, Mid Sweden University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Aamir","lastName":"Mahmood","id":"37408373900"},{"name":"Rafia Mumtaz","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rafia","lastName":"Mumtaz","id":"37071270200"},{"name":"S.

In this paper, we study a wireless-powered backscatter communication system, where the sensors use a hybrid channel access scheme by combining time division multiplexing access (TDMA) with power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) to enhance the system performance in terms of outage probability and throughput. Our analysis shows that the proposed PD-NOMA increases both the spectrum efficiency and the throughput of the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless

ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) channel codes, but its strict latency and reliability requirements pose signicant challenges to the existing decoding schemes, especially in terms of decoding latency. In this paper, we propose a neural network based successive cancellation (NN-SC) decoding algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, neural networks are used to replace the local decoders for rate-R constituent codes because of their one-shot decoding capacity, which greatly reduce the decoding latency and algorithmic complexity. The simulation results indicate that the NN-SC decoding algorithm can achieve comparable reliability performance against the successive cancellation (SC) decoding for a polar code of length 128 and rate 1/6, while reducing the decoding latency by 65.2% when compared with the simplified SC decoding. In addition, for two conventional decoding algorithms: SC and belief propagation (BP) decoding, the proposed algorithm can further reduce the decoding latency by 22.8% and 13.8%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877103","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877103.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based Successive Cancellation Decoding Algorithm for Polar Codes in URLLC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Successive Cancellation Decoding Algorithm for Polar Codes in URLLC","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19079593","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877103/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877103/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Successive Cancellation Decoding Algorithm for Polar Codes in URLLC","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"C35_1570549812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060002S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877111,"authors":[{"name":"Im\u00e8ne Ghamnia","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Chatillon, France"],"firstName":"Im\u00e8ne","lastName":"Ghamnia","id":"37086172440"},{"name":"Dirk Slock","affiliation":["Communication Systems Department, EURECOM, France"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Slock","id":"37266845200"},{"name":"Yi Yuan-Wu","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Chatillon, France"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yuan-Wu","id":"38338950600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877111","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Downlink","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","MIMO communication","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","multi-access systems","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO max-min user rate","user rate balancing","power constraints","multiuser Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output system","max-min rate problem","matrix-weighted user Mean Squared Error balancing","user fairness","min-max matrix-weighted MSE optimization problem","power allocation","minimum down-link rate","balancing operation","unweighted MSE balancing","weighted MSE balancing","downlink transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rate balancing","max-min fairness","Lagrange duality","transceiver optimization","multi-user MIMO"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of user rate balancing with power constraints for the downlink transmission of multiuser Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) system.

Unlike different variants of approximate matrix inversion methods presented in literature that minimize the approximation error to the exact inversion case, it is proposed here to find the approximation maximizing the resulting achieved signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) assuming zero-forcing precoding (ZF). Simulation results show that the proposed precoding method is more efficient in terms of the achieved sum rate, yet with comparable computational complexity to other methods in literature. The performance gain is more significant especially for the case of high system loading and/or high correlation which both are considered inevitable in future wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877131","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877131.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","startPage":"495","endPage":"499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Low-Complexity Matrix Inversion Method for Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Low-Complexity Matrix Inversion Method for Massive MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877131/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079579","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877131/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Low-Complexity Matrix Inversion Method for Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"I95_1570538327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062953S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877136,"authors":[{"name":"Junbeom Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Junbeom","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086295132"},{"name":"Daesung Yu","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Daesung","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086289236"},{"name":"Sung-Hyun Moon","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Hyun","lastName":"Moon","id":"37288035500"},{"name":"Seok-Hwan Park","affiliation":["Division of Electronic Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Seok-Hwan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293216300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877136","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Wireless communication","Precoding","Radio frequency","Optimization","Baseband","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cellular radio","multi-access systems","multicast communication","optimisation","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grouped NOMA multicast transmission","Fog Radio Access Network","F-RAN","wireless fronthaul link","user equipments","central processor","requested files","distributed edge nodes","local caches","nonorthogonal multiple access scheme","CP-to-ENs fronthaul","ENs-to-UEs edge links","NOMA transmission strategies","transmission power constraints","joint fronthaul"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["F-RAN","NOMA","content-centric multicasting","wireless fronthaul","edge caching"]}],"abstract":"A Fog Radio Access Network (F-RAN) equipped with wireless fronthaul link is considered.

Our analyses also indicate that for DPS, user-specific clustering with 3-dB power range achieves the major improvement of URLLC latency.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877140","startPage":"379","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877140.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5G URLLC Performance Analysis of Dynamic-Point Selection Multi-User Resource Allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877140/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"5G URLLC Performance Analysis of Dynamic-Point Selection Multi-User Resource Allocation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19079581","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877140/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5G URLLC Performance Analysis of Dynamic-Point Selection Multi-User Resource Allocation","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"G72_1570549089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057722S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877149,"authors":[{"name":"Jukka Talvitie","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, Finland"],"firstName":"Jukka","lastName":"Talvitie","id":"37602541800"},{"name":"Toni Levanen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, Finland"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Levanen","id":"37569021000"},{"name":"Mike Koivisto","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, Finland"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Koivisto","id":"37085688727"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877149","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877149","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Position measurement","Antenna measurements","Mathematical model","Rail transportation","Delays","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fifth generation communications services","high rate data links","high reliability mission-critical services","HSTs","5G new radio networks","angle-of-arrival measurements","specific 5G NR reference signals","millimeter wave frequency","train position","absolute train velocity","train heading","state-dependent process variance","positioning performance","conventional linear state-transition modeling","real-life high-speed track","positioning engine","high-speed trains","nonlinear state model","time difference of arrival measurements","size 2.3 m","velocity 0.47 m/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Positioning","Extended Kalman filter","EKF","Fifth generation mobile networks","5G","New Radio","NR","High-speed trains","HST"]}],"abstract":"High-speed trains (HSTs) with fifth generation (5G) communications services, including both high rate data links and high reliability mission-critical services, are considered as one of the new industry verticals facilitated by the 5G connectivity.

Moreover, the HST is tracked with an extended Kalman filter, where, instead of conventional linear state-transition model, we propose and derive a non-linear state-transition model, including the train position, absolute train velocity, and train heading. Furthermore, by introducing a state-dependent process variance for the angular velocity of the train, we show that the positioning performance of the HST can be significantly improved compared to the conventional linear state-transition modeling. Based on realistic simulations on a real-life high-speed track, we show that the proposed positioning engine can reach 95% percentile estimation accuracies of 2.3 m, 0.47 m/s, and 1.6 deg, for the train position, train velocity, and train heading, respectively, thus fulfilling the requirements specified by the 3GPP for machine control and transportation services.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877149","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877149.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"314","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positioning and Tracking of High-speed Trains with Non-linear State Model for 5G and Beyond Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Positioning and Tracking of High-speed Trains with Non-linear State Model for 5G and Beyond Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877149/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079543","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877149/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Positioning and Tracking of High-speed Trains with Non-linear State Model for 5G and Beyond Systems","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"E59_1570552601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06215S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8877152,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Ge","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Ge","id":"37086807219"},{"name":"Zhimin Zeng","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288929900"},{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiankui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288850400"},{"name":"Yan Sun","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37897850800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877152","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Antenna arrays","Kalman filters","Wireless communication","Covariance matrices","Tracking","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","Kalman filters","millimetre wave communication","MIMO communication","nonlinear estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV-enabled mmW mMIMO systems","UAV-enabled millimeter wave massive MIMO systems","high-speed wireless access","unscented Kalman filter based beam tracking scheme","nonlinear estimation problem","channel angle vector","channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV","mmW","beam tracking","UKF"]}],"abstract":"Fueled by the incessantly growing need of high-speed wireless access in the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled millimeter wave (mmW) massive multiple input multiple output (mMIMO) has become an attractive solution to provide high capacity wireless transmission.

A-MIMO-RoC, by leveraging a fully analog implementation, completely avoids any dedicated digital interface by using a transparent end-to-end system, with consequent latency, bandwidth and cost benefits. Usually, LAN cables are exploited mainly in the low-frequency spectrum portion, mostly due to the moderate cable attenuation and crosstalk among twisted-pairs. Unlike current systems based on LAN cables, the key feature of the proposed platform is to exploit more efficiently the huge bandwidth capability offered by LAN cables, that contain 4 twistedpairs reaching up to 500 MHz bandwidth/pair when the length is below 100 m. Several works proposed numerical simulations that assert the feasibility of employing LAN cables for indoor FH applications up to several hundreds of MHz, but an A-MIMO-RoC experimental evaluation is still missing. Here, we present some preliminary results obtained with an A-MIMO-RoC prototype made by low-cost all-analog/all-passive devices along the signal path. This setup demonstrates experimentally the feasibility of the proposed analog relaying of MIMO RF signals over LAN cables up to 400 MHz, thus enabling an efficient exploitation of the LAN cables transport capabilities for 5G indoor applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog MIMO Radio-over-Copper: Prototype and Preliminary Experimental Results","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877154","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877154.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Analog MIMO Radio-over-Copper: Prototype and Preliminary Experimental Results","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877154/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079478","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog MIMO Radio-over-Copper: Prototype and Preliminary Experimental Results","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"N140_1570557003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051937S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877155,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos Katz","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Katz","id":"37275085300"},{"name":"Pekka Pirinen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Pirinen","id":"37269607400"},{"name":"Harri Posti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Harri","lastName":"Posti","id":"37612097600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877155","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1771},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["6G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","Wireless communication","Industries","Ecosystems","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Finland","wireless world","mobile world","wireless landscape","beyond 5G technology","6G technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless communications","mobile communications","B5G","6G","5G evolution","future wireless and mobile networks","developing 6G"]}],"abstract":"As the wireless and mobile world is turning its interest into beyond 5G development, industry and research community are gradually taking up this colossal challenge. This paper discusses the readiness and capacity needed to develop beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G technology and their associated businesses and applications. The wireless landscape is analyzed in different timeframes covering roughly the period between 2020 and 2030, the decade where B5G and 6G are expected to be fully developed. After discussing relevant trends and key requirements needed to develop B5G and 6G in general, the paper will consider, as a particular example, the current development and readiness of Finland. With a strong background in 5G, Finland is one of the first countries to start doing 6G development following a large research project where key industrial and academic players of the country participate. Hopefully, the conceived developing path to 6G presented in this paper will serve a motivational guide to other developers.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877155","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877155.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards 6G: Getting Ready for the Next Decade","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Towards 6G: Getting Ready for the Next Decade","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877155/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19079584","htmlLink":"/document/8877155/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards 6G: Getting Ready for the Next Decade","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"M137_1570554962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051561S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877160,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Keating","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Keating","id":"37085486584"},{"name":"Mikko S\u00e4ily","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"S\u00e4ily","id":"37713583800"},{"name":"Jari Hulkkonen","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Hulkkonen","id":"37427018800"},{"name":"Juha Karjalainen","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Karjalainen","id":"37391083500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877160","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2699},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877160","abstract":"Accurate and real time location knowledge is an important requirement for various new services like e.g. emergency services, vehicular related use cases and factories of the future. 3GPP Rel-16 will specify positioning support for 5G New Radio (NR).

Several positioning solutions will be supported in 5G NR. The operation in higher carrier frequencies and utilization of massive antenna arrays provides additional degrees of freedom to improve the positioning accuracy compared to LTE. Rel-16 positioning is targeting to <; 3 meters positioning accuracy for some use cases. Next 3GPP Releases are expected to further specify methods for sub-meter accuracy and low latency.

One major deficiency of most existing hybrid beamforming designs is the assumption of infinite or high-resolution phase shifters (PSs) in analog beamformer implementations. The employment of low-resolution PSs is more feasible because of hardware limitations. In this paper, we investigate the design of hybrid beamformers with low-resolution PSs in mmWave MIMO systems. In order to achieve better spectral efficiency, a joint codebook selection and precoder design scheme is presented. We first construct a set of shifted DFT codebooks, and then select the best one among them. Based on the chosen codebook, the optimal precoder and combiner can be determined using channel gain or searching algorithm. The computational complexity is also analyzed. Simulation results reveal the performance advantages of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877165","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877165.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","startPage":"283","endPage":"287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Precoder Design for mmWave Massive MIMO with Low-Resolution Phase Shifters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Precoder Design for mmWave Massive MIMO with Low-Resolution Phase Shifters","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877165/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079526","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877165/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Precoder Design for mmWave Massive MIMO with Low-Resolution Phase Shifters","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"E54_1570542977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075294S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877175,"authors":[{"name":"Anderson Tregancini","affiliation":["S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Boa Vista, Brazil"],"firstName":"Anderson","lastName":"Tregancini","id":"37087054471"},{"name":"Carlos H.

Due to powerful loop interference in full-duplex (FD) relaying, however, low resolution ADCs generate strong quantization noise that has severe impact on the throughput of the system. In this paper, the throughput and energy efficiency of a FD decode-and-forward relay system with low resolution ADCs is investigated. Based on the mathematical analysis, a novel iterative power allocation scheme that mitigates the impact of the quantization noise via reducing the received LI power is proposed. The power allocation scheme aims at maximizing the end-to-end achievable rate by adjusting the per-link transmit powers at the relay. The numerical results show that compared to half-duplex relaying, using FD with the proposed power allocation scheme improves the system throughput and energy efficiency significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877176","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877176.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for Multipair Massive MIMO FD Relay Systems with Low Resolution ADCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877176/","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for Multipair Massive MIMO FD Relay Systems with Low Resolution ADCs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079553","htmlLink":"/document/8877176/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation for Multipair Massive MIMO FD Relay Systems with Low Resolution ADCs","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"I97_1570549085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114841S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877183,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Penner","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Penner","id":"37085899126"},{"name":"Martin Fuhrwerk","affiliation":["RFmondial GmbH, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Fuhrwerk","id":"38490294900"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig","id":"38526253800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877183","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Indexes","Probability density function","Zirconium","Delays","Scattering","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","channel bank filters","channel estimation","error statistics","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bit Error probability","asynchronous channel access","FBMC-OQAM","Machine-Type Communication","MTC","mobile communication systems","centrally coordinated systems","research asynchronous communication","transmit-only devices","Filter Bank Multicarrier","highly adaptable modulation scheme","feedback-less networks","unavoidable collisions","device signals","closed-form Bit Error Rate expression","BER","FBMC signals","doubly-selective channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MTC","FBMC","OQAM","asynchronous channel access","feedback-less networks"]}],"abstract":"Machine-Type Communication (MTC) will play an essential role in 5G as well as other future mobile communication systems. Within the next ten years several billion devices will be interconnected worldwide. However, large numbers of participants lead to controlling overhead in centrally coordinated systems. For this reason, we research asynchronous communication with transmit-only devices in combination with Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC), a highly adaptable modulation scheme. A key challenge of feedback-less networks are the unavoidable collisions between device signals. In this contribution, we derive a closed-form Bit Error Rate (BER) expression for colliding FBMC signals. The results are valid for any number of colliders, each sending its signal through separate correlated or uncorrelated doubly-selective channels. We show that the BER mainly depends on the amplitude ratio between the signals, while the relative time offset has little effect.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877183","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","startPage":"522","endPage":"526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit Error Probability for Asynchronous Channel Access in Feedback-Less MTC with FBMC-OQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit Error Probability for Asynchronous Channel Access in Feedback-Less MTC with FBMC-OQAM","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877183/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079464","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877183/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Error Probability for Asynchronous Channel Access in Feedback-Less MTC with FBMC-OQAM","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"J100_1570542807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055401S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877186,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The prototype is designed to operate at 28 GHz and is capable of 9 beam projections in azimuth and elevation zones. We evaluate the ergodic sum spectral efficiency of a 9-user uplink MU-MIMO system when the user equipments' (UE) dominant paths are assumed to be aligned with the predefined beam directions. We point out the primary sources of some of the most prominent EM losses and discuss design guidelines for their possible mitigation at both the RF front-end and the signal processing (SP) blocks. Our investigation shows the practical limitations of the system and predicts the achievable performance. Interestingly, our conclusions hold valid for a scaled version of the same hybrid beamformer architecture supporting a larger number of antenna elements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877186/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19079522","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877186/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter Wave Hybrid Beamforming with Rotman Lens: Performance with Hardware Imperfections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter Wave Hybrid Beamforming with Rotman Lens: Performance with Hardware Imperfections","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"C39_1570552720.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049695S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8877188,"authors":[{"name":"Bilal Khan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Bilal","lastName":"Khan","id":"37087054435"},{"name":"Nuutti Tervo","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Nuutti","lastName":"Tervo","id":"37085553500"},{"name":"Aarno P\u00e4rssinen","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Aarno","lastName":"P\u00e4rssinen","id":"37266079200"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877188","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Predistortion","Arrays","Array signal processing","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","power amplifiers","radio transmitters","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average linearity performance","continuously trained reference DPD","32 elements uniform array","phased array transmitters","random amplitude","parallel power amplifier branches","digital predistortion","nonlinear behavior","training mechanism","PA branches","resultant mean DPD coefficients","phase variation differences"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877188","abstract":"We study the impact of amplitude and phase differences between the parallel power amplifier (PA) branches in a phased array and their impact on the performance of the digital predistortion (DPD).

For 4G and 5G, Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) has been chosen. Nevertheless, because of the poor spectral containment of CP-OFDM, many MCM schemes with better frequency localizations have been developed in the past few years. These waveforms (WF) are classically named as post-OFDM WFs. In this paper, we will focus on Block-Filtered OFDM (BF-OFDM) waveform which has a very good frequency localization because of its prototype filter, which allows sharp filtering of subcarrier blocks and has the same classical receiver as CP-OFDM. Nevertheless, like any Multicarrier modulation, BF-OFDM has a high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of the same order as that of the OFDM. In this paper, we propose a DFT spread technique to BF-OFDM for the uplink and compare the performances in terms of PAPR reduction with DFT spread CP-OFDM named SC-OFDM or SC-FDMA. We show that the performances obtained in PAPR reduction with DFT spread BF-OFDM are very close to those obtained with SC-FDMA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction of BF-OFDM waveform using DFT-Spread technique","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877195","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877195.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction of BF-OFDM waveform using DFT-Spread technique","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877195/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079495","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction of BF-OFDM waveform using DFT-Spread technique","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"G77_1570549681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081662S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877198,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Mattera","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Mattera","id":"37428688400"},{"name":"Mario Tanda","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Tanda","id":"37271295400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877198","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Base stations","Prototypes","Transmitters","Time-frequency analysis","Uplink","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio spectrum management","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","FBMC-OQAM transceiver","wireless networks","multiple access scenario","wireless channels"]}],"abstract":"The analysis of the spectral efficiency that can be achieved by using the FBMC-OQAM transceiver in the uplink of the modern wireless networks is carried out.

Fortunately, the pulse shaping filter method has proven its potential to reduce ICI without the cost of increasing the complexity of the OFDM modem. In order to improve the OFDM tolerance against the oscillator frequency detuning, we introduce the better than double jump 2 (BTDJ2) pulse. It is characterized by one additional design parameter apart from the roll-off factor. In addition, the improved filter is optimized following a representative system configuration. The BTDJ2 is compared with other novel pulses in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR) and frequency offset requirements for a well known practical forward error correction (FEC) limit. Further, complexity evaluation of the BTDJ2 and other novel pulses is done in terms of the average elapsed convolution time. In general, the sub-optimum BTDJ2 outperforms other novel pulses in terms of the bit error rate (BER) and complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER Improvement Using the Better than Double-Jump 2 Pulse in OFDM Schemes Prone to Frequency Offset","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877206","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877206.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"BER Improvement Using the Better than Double-Jump 2 Pulse in OFDM Schemes Prone to Frequency Offset","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877206/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079510","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Improvement Using the Better than Double-Jump 2 Pulse in OFDM Schemes Prone to Frequency Offset","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"I99_1570539287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103195S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877221,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zlem Tugfe Demir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"\u00d6zlem Tugfe","lastName":"Demir","id":"37062071800"},{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rnson","id":"37322949300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877221","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877221","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Hardware","Nonlinear distortion","Uplink","Receivers","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Bayes methods","channel estimation","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","least mean squares methods","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general hardware impairments","multiple-antenna base station","distortion-aware receivers","finite-sized signal constellations","error estimators","deep learning approach","impairment characteristics","LMMSE methods","channel estimation","unaware Bayesian linear minimum methods","deep feedforward neural network design","Bayesian linear minimum mean-squared error estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware impairments","channel estimation","distortion-aware receiver","deep learning"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the impact of general hardware impairments in a multiple-antenna base station and user equipments on the uplink performance.

One of the inevitable feature of such advanced radar signals is pulse compression which is responsible for the accuracy, resolution and determination of ambiguity of the range of the target. In the process of maximizing SNR by a factor of the time-bandwidth product of the waveform by a matched filter, relatively strong sidelobes of fixed Peak-to-sidelobe(PSL) ratio remain in the autocorrelation function. Use of certain \"mis-matched\" filters help in reducing the sidelobes but at the cost of reduced resolution. In this paper, an approach using a multilayered feed forward neural network for pulse compression is detailed for its near zero level of sidelobes also without compromising on the range resolution of the radar.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877226/","accessionNumber":"19079219","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877226/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High PSL Radar Pulse Compression using Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High PSL Radar Pulse Compression using Neural Network","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"1570485311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066113S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8863808","isNumber":"8877097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863808","xplore-issue":"8877097","articleId":"8877226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8877230,"authors":[{"name":"Mubarak Umar Aminu","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mubarak Umar","lastName":"Aminu","id":"37086003619"},{"name":"Janne Lehtom\u00e4ki","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Lehtom\u00e4ki","id":"38539864000"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877230","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Phase noise","Array signal processing","Transceivers","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Gaussian processes","millimetre wave communication","phase noise","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise","local oscillators","beam shape properties","beamforming","transceiver optimization","transceiver signal processing","covariance structure"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the impact of phase noise on the transceiver signal processing originating from the local oscillators (LOs).

In such scenarios, the cell-to-cell interference (CCI) arising from parasitic coupling-capacitance between adjacent cells becomes more severe, which will significantly distort the threshold voltage and deteriorate the data-storage reliability. In this paper, through analyzing the characteristics of threshold voltage distribution of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code MLC NAND flash memory, a post-processing detection scheme is proposed to mitigate the CCI. The proposed scheme utilizes both the neighbor-cell information and the neighbor-a-priori information, and thus is referred to as the Mixed-NCI detector. A salient feature of the proposed detection scheme is that it can acquire very accurate read-back voltages by exploiting the neighbor-cell information of the successfully decoded cells. Analyses and simulation results show that the proposed Mixed-NCI detector achieves remarkable performance gains compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The above advantage makes the Mixed-NCI detector extremely attractive for MLC NAND flash memory.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877237","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877237.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neighbor-Cell-Information Based Detection for LDPC Coded MLC NAND Flash Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Neighbor-Cell-Information Based Detection for LDPC Coded MLC NAND Flash Memory","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877237/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079521","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877237/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighbor-Cell-Information Based Detection for LDPC Coded MLC NAND Flash Memory","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"3_1570550867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152835S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877239,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Moltafet","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications \u2013 Radio Technologies, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Moltafet","id":"37085879768"},{"name":"Markus Leinonen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications \u2013 Radio Technologies, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Leinonen","id":"38580762200"},{"name":"Marian Codreanu","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Codreanu","id":"37268997300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877239","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Measurement","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Wireless sensor networks","Information age","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","Internet of Things","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst case analysis","shared-access channel","status update packets","status update system","wireless channel","channel access","carrier sense multiple access method","information metric","CSMA-based system","packet arrival rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Age of information (AoI)","multi-access channel","CSMA/CA","M/G/1 queueing model"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst Case Analysis of Age of Information in a Shared-Access Channel","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","endPage":"617","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877239","startPage":"613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877239","abstract":"Freshness of status update packets is essential for enabling a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this paper, we consider a status update system in which various sensors are assigned to transmit status update packets of a physical process to a desired destination. We consider that the sensors share a wireless channel and contend for the channel access based on a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) method. We study freshness of the status update system at the destination using the age of information (AoI) metric. To this end, we analyze the worst case average AoI for each sensor in the CSMA-based system. Numerical results show that the AoI in the CSMA-based system may dramatically increase when the number of sensors increases. Moreover, we observe that the contention window size and the packet arrival rate must be optimized since they have a critical role in the performance of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19079509","htmlLink":"/document/8877239/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Worst Case Analysis of Age of Information in a Shared-Access Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst Case Analysis of Age of Information in a Shared-Access Channel","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"K118_1570549794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073415S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877240,"authors":[{"name":"Sk Nurul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Tele-Comm.

Grant-free random access, where channel resources are accessed without undergoing assignment through a handshake process, is proposed in 5G New Radio as an important latency reducing solution. However, this comes at an increased likelihood of collisions resulting from uncoordinated channel access. Novel reliability enhancement techniques are therefore needed. This article provides an overview of grant-free random access in 5G New Radio focusing on the ultra-reliable low latency communication service class, and presents two reliability-enhancing solutions. The first proposes retransmissions over shared resources, whereas the second proposal incorporates grant-free transmission with non-orthogonal multiple access where overlapping transmissions are resolved through the use of advanced receivers. Both proposed solutions result in significant performance gains, in terms of reliability as well as resource efficiency. For example, the proposed non-orthogonal multiple access scheme can support a normalized load of more than 1.5 users/slot at packet loss rates of ~ 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n a significant improvement over conventional grant-free schemes like slotted-ALOHA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877253","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877253.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"612","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Grant-Free Access Solutions for URLLC services in 5G New Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Grant-Free Access Solutions for URLLC services in 5G New Radio","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877253/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079538","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877253/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Grant-Free Access Solutions for URLLC services in 5G New Radio","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"K117_1570554349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044123S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8877256,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Marcastel","affiliation":["ETIS, Universit\u00e9 Paris Seine, Universit\u00e9 Cergy-Pontoise, ENSEA, CNRS, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Marcastel","id":"37086043220"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ETIS, Universit\u00e9 Paris Seine, Universit\u00e9 Cergy-Pontoise, ENSEA, CNRS, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"},{"name":"Lee Swindlehurst","affiliation":["EECS, University of California at Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Swindlehurst","id":"38559010100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877256","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","Power demand","Quantization (signal)","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","interference suppression","MIMO communication","precoding","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-coding","high signal dynamic range","quantized Zero-Forcing precoded systems","massive MIMO base station","energy efficient downlink massive MIMO","wireless base stations","coherently operating antennas","single antenna users","transmission capacity","energy-efficiency trade-off"]}],"abstract":"Massive MIMO aims to build wireless base stations with hundreds of coherently operating antennas serving tens of single antenna users in order to improve both the transmission capacity by a factor 10-50 and the energy-efficiency trade-off by up to a thousand times.

In the paper, we study the distributed compressive sensing (DCS) under the constraint of 1-bit quantization at each node. The entire transmission chain, composed of compressive sensing, 1-bit quantization, and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), is taken into consideration with joint signal reconstruction at the fusion center. A lower bound on the end-to-end mean square error distortion, which is a function of the measurement rate, distortion of 1-bit quantization, and that of JSCC, is derived under the assumption of the oracle reconstruction. The time-varying channel conditions have a major impact on the distortion of JSCC. Therefore, a suboptimal yet efficient power allocation scheme based on the successive convex approximation method is proposed to minimize the lower bound on the end-to-end distortion. Moreover, a practical coding and joint signal reconstruction scheme is provided to show its consistence with the derived theoretical limits.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877262","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877262.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","startPage":"587","endPage":"591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for Distributed Compressive Sensing with 1-Bit Quantization over Noisy Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for Distributed Compressive Sensing with 1-Bit Quantization over Noisy Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877262/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079542","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877262/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation for Distributed Compressive Sensing with 1-Bit Quantization over Noisy Channels","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"K113_1570554035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136064S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877267,"authors":[{"name":"Ekta Aggrawal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Ekta","lastName":"Aggrawal","id":"37086115948"},{"name":"Karun Rawat","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Karun","lastName":"Rawat","id":"38553807400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8221-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8220-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8222-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-9152"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-9144"}],"articleNumber":"8877267","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Modulation","Switches","Power combiners","Radio frequency","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","HEMT integrated circuits","III-V semiconductors","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched mode power amplifier","wireless communication","Chireix outphasing system","switched mode GaN HEMT power amplifiers","Chireix power combining network","reactance compensation circuit","outphased amplified signals","nonisolated signal combiner","frequency 1.6 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chireix power combiner","Gallium Nitride","HEMT","outphasing","switched mode power amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877267","doi":"10.1109/IMaRC.2018.8877267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMaRC.2018.8877267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877097","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference (IMaRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference (IMaRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863808/8877097/08877267.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chireix Outphasing Switched Mode Power Amplifier for Wireless Communication","abstract":"This paper presents design and analysis of a Chireix outphasing system using two switched mode GaN HEMT power amplifiers and Chireix power combining network at 1.6 GHz.

The training process was performed based on data from a real world experiment using Software Defined Radio (SDR) for monitoring a Wi-Fi channel. The Makiuchi MAC protocol was implemented using the discrete event simulator OMNeT++ and INET networking framework. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the expected behavior of the Makiuchi protocol in the process of identification and allocation of Secondary Users' transmission opportunities.

The channel state information (CSI) based and data-aided SLP technique optimizes power efficiency by solving a non-negative convex quadratic optimization problem per time frame of transmitted symbols. The optimization combines constructive inter-user interference to minimize the sum power of precoded symbols at the transmitter side under constraints for minimum SNR at the receiver side. The SLP implementation incurs extra computational complexity of the transmitter. We propose a convex quadratic optimization problem for M-QAM constellations and derive a closed-form algorithm with a fixed number of iterations to solve the problem.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877286","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","startPage":"395","endPage":"399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-QAM Modulation Symbol-Level Precoding for Power Minimization: Closed-Form Solution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"M-QAM Modulation Symbol-Level Precoding for Power Minimization: Closed-Form Solution","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877286/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079545","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877286/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-QAM Modulation Symbol-Level Precoding for Power Minimization: Closed-Form Solution","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"G75_1570552663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057996S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877288,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto L\u00f3pez-Valcarce","affiliation":["atlanTTic Research Center \u2013 University of Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Valcarce","id":"38275836800"},{"name":"Nuria Gonz\u00e1lez-Prelcic","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Nuria","lastName":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Prelcic","id":"38314617900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877288","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave communication","precoding","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog beamforming","full-duplex millimeter wave communication","spectral efficiency","millimeter wave systems","antenna arrays","SI mitigation","precoder- combiner designs","hardware-constrained architectures","constant-amplitude analog precoders","FD mmWave single-stream bidirectional link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex","millimeter wave communications","analog beamforming"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog beamforming for Full-Duplex Millimeter Wave Communication","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","endPage":"691","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877288.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877288","startPage":"687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877288","abstract":"Full-duplex (FD) communication has the potential for significant improvements in spectral efficiency, as long as the problem of self-interference (SI) can be overcome.

Previously proposed precoder- combiner designs, however, suffer from a large performance loss under the hardware-constrained architectures required for operation at mmWave.

At the receive side, we propose a hybrid combiner which involves an analog phase shifter based BF, with fewer RF chains compared to the number of receive antennas and a digital (baseband) BF in OFDM domain. The analog BF helps reduce SI before analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). All BFs optimize alternatingly a weighted sum mean squared error (WSMSE) equivalent of the weighted sum rate over uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channels.

Offloading to MWBS is performed based on the average received power from the base stations of the two tiers, i.e., UHBS and MWBS tier. Both the UHBS and MWBS employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to support the users. Furthermore, the impact of the channel gain difference (CGD) between the users paired at the MWBS tier is investigated in detail. The numerical results show that offloading to MWBS achieves significant improvement in the outage probability of the offloaded user. In addition, offloading to MWBS tier also improves the outage performance at the UHBS tier. Besides, it is observed that the CGD between the paired users at the MWBS tier plays a vital role in the outage performance of the offloaded user. The analytical results are verified using Monte Carlo simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877297.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability of Ultra High Frequency and Millimeter Wave Based HetNets with NOMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Probability","Interference","Power system reliability","Signal to noise ratio","Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave communication","Monte Carlo methods","multi-access systems","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","NOMA","nonorthogonal multiple access","millimeter wave based HetNets","ultrahigh frequency base stations","heterogeneous network","UHBS","millimeter wave base stations","MWBS","channel gain difference","CGD","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access","millimeter wave communication","heterogeneous network","outage probability","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability of Ultra High Frequency and Millimeter Wave Based HetNets with NOMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877297/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079562","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability of Ultra High Frequency and Millimeter Wave Based HetNets with NOMA","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"C32_1570552740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083121S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877298,"authors":[{"name":"Mario G.

First, the non-zero coefficients of each signal are quantized and then mapped onto a finite field. Subsequently, measurements obtained by compressed sensing (CS) over finite fields, where Low-density Parity-check (LDPC) matrices are adopted as CS encoding matrices, are modulated and conveyed through separate additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Such an order for the encoder is named as \"first quantization, then compressed sensing\". For joint recovery, a novel joint belief propagation (JBP) algorithm is applied at the sink node, where a new type of constraint node, i.e., correlation constraint nodes is introduced, which connect two factor graphs that separately represent the CS encoding matrix of each signal. Experimental results prove that the proposed scheme outperforms the scheme that ignores the correlated information between the signals, especially when the correlation is high. Moreover, we compare the proposed framework vis-a-vis \"first compressed sensing, then quantization\" framework and validate the superiority in terms of recovery quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877301/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19079474","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877301/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Digital Codec for Jointly Sparse Correlated Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Digital Codec for Jointly Sparse Correlated Signals","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"1_1570552337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066559S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":8877306,"authors":[{"name":"Flavio Maschietti","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Flavio","lastName":"Maschietti","id":"37086274808"},{"name":"G\u00e1bor Fodor","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"G\u00e1bor","lastName":"Fodor","id":"37270461500"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"},{"name":"Paul de Kerret","affiliation":["EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"de Kerret","id":"37394374200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877306","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"abstract":"While acquiring channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) in time division duplexing systems can exploit channel reciprocity, acquiring accurate CSIT in frequency division duplexing massive multiple-input multiple-output systems is not trivial. The two main difficulties in these systems are the scalability of the downlink reference signals and the overhead associated with the required uplink feedback. Although several approaches for ensuring scalability and reducing overhead by leveraging some presumed channel properties have been studied, existing schemes do not offer a fully satisfactory solution. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative method which exploits low-rate beam-related information exchange between the mobile terminals, reduces the overhead under the assumption of the so-called grid-of-beams design, and strikes a balance between CSIT acquisition overhead, user spatial separability and coordination complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on

of different systems without precise time-frequency synchronization is limited due to high out-of-band emissions. Therefore, filtered-OFDM (F-OFDM) type spectrum enhancement can play a key role to relax the synchronization requirements as it provides well-contained spectrum through subband based filtering. This allows higher degree of flexible and dynamic spectrum use with minimized interference. However, this approach increases computational complexity compared with CP-OFDM. This paper presents a low-complexity solution for narrow-band F-OFDM transmitters based on the use of a look-up table (LUT) to store the F-OFDM waveform. This approach can be applied equally well for filtered version of the discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) waveform with small number of subcarriers. DFT-s-OFDM is commonly used in the uplink of OFDM-based systems to mitigate high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM. The scheme is particularly interesting for the transmitters of Internet-of-Things (IoT) or massive machine type communication (mMTC) devices operating at low data rate. The LUT approach requires only memory units and relatively low number of additions. Moreover, we propose a low-complexity solution to deal with the CP-length variations within the transmission frame. The required memory wordlengths are evaluated through simulations. Comparisons with time-domain filtering and fast-convolution-based filtering solutions are included as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877309.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Look-Up Table Based Implementation of Ultra-Low Complexity Narrowband OFDM Transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Table lookup","Long Term Evolution","Uplink","Discrete Fourier transforms","3GPP","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convolution","discrete Fourier transforms","filtering theory","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrow-band F-OFDM transmitters","filtered version","discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM waveform","DFT-s-OFDM","OFDM-based systems","massive machine type communication","low data rate","LUT approach","low-complexity solution","time-domain filtering","ultra-low complexity","cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing based radio access","CP-OFDM","precise time-frequency synchronization","out-of-band emissions","synchronization requirements","flexible spectrum use","dynamic spectrum use","computational complexity","low data rate","look-up table based implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NB-IoT","DFT-s-OFDM","filtered OFDM","multi-carrier waveforms","OFDM","look-up table","5G New Radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Look-Up Table Based Implementation of Ultra-Low Complexity Narrowband OFDM Transmitters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877309/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079566","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Look-Up Table Based Implementation of Ultra-Low Complexity Narrowband OFDM Transmitters","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"B25_1570548868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168408S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877311,"authors":[{"name":"Robert M.

for IoT (Internet of Things) services needs flexible wireless access techniques to support various types of IoT services without sacrifice of performance degradation, while satisfying low ACLP (Adjacent Channel Leakage Power) and low PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio) requirements. Various OFDM-based and DFTs-OFDM based waveforms have been proposed to satisfy these requirements. On the other hand, as an offset-QAM is known as a low PAPR modulation scheme compared with standard QAM scheme, application of OQAM to DFTs-OFDM seems an interesting approach. This paper proposes a novel Overlap-Windowed-OQAM-DFTs-OFDM scheme to achieve low PAPR and ACLP. It also describes performance evaluation results of the proposed scheme by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877312","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877312.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overlap-Windowed-OQAM-DFTs-OFDM Scheme to Achieve Low PAPR and ACLP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877312/","displayDocTitle":"An Overlap-Windowed-OQAM-DFTs-OFDM Scheme to Achieve Low PAPR and ACLP","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079477","htmlLink":"/document/8877312/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overlap-Windowed-OQAM-DFTs-OFDM Scheme to Achieve Low PAPR and ACLP","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"B24_1570542971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051897S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877322,"authors":[{"name":"Takumi Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Technology, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Takumi","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37085998521"},{"name":"Antti T\u00f6lli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"T\u00f6lli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"Shinsuke Ibi","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinsuke","lastName":"Ibi","id":"37403574200"},{"name":"Seiichi Sampei","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Technology, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Sampei","id":"38262497100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877322","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"This paper proposes concatenated beam- and antenna-domain belief propagation (BP) based signal detector for realizing low-complexity large multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) detection. As a low-complexity strategy for large-scale MU detection (MUD), group-specific signal detection in the beam domain has been proposed, where user equipments (UEs) are grouped based on the long-term channel statistics at a base station (BS) to design outer beamformer (OBF). In this case, the BP-based algorithm is effective as the subsequent signal detector to compensate for the performance degradation due to the dimensionality reduction caused by the OBF. However, the convergence characteristics of beam-domain BP is degraded as compared to the antenna-domain BP due to increased correlation between the beliefs. To avoid the impairments, we propose a novel concatenated structure of beam- and antenna-domain BP layers, which allows us to benefit from the advantages of both domains while maintaining low signal processing complexity. Numerical results show the validity of our proposed method in terms of the bit error rate (BER) performance both in the coded and uncoded cases and the computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems

However, it is found to be resource inefficient, since radio resources from more than one transmitters are required to serve a single user. Improving the performance enhancement vs. resource utilization tradeoff with MC is therefore a key design challenge. This work proposes a heuristic resource efficient latency-aware dynamic MC algorithm which activates MC selectively such that its benefits are harnessed for critical users, while minimizing the corresponding resource usage. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver the outage performance gains of legacy MC schemes while requiring up to 45% less resources.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877325","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877325.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"116","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Multi-Connectivity Activation for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Multi-Connectivity Activation for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877325/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079500","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877325/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Multi-Connectivity Activation for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"B22_1570554778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063529S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8877330,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumar","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Darbhanga College of Engineering, Bihar, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37087053841"},{"name":"A.

Furthermore, our results reveal that the distortion-aware LMMSE receiver can compensate in part for the performance loss due to nonlinear distortion over MU-MIMO-OFDM uplink system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877331.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"212","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Distortion-Aware Linear Receivers in Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Receivers","Hardware","OFDM","Numerical models","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion-aware linear receivers","uplink massive MIMO systems","single-cell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system","nonlinear distortion","base station","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing transmission","Bussgang's theorem","equivalent linear model","distortion-aware linear minimum","squared error-based receiver","distortion-aware LMMSE receiver","MU-MIMO-OFDM uplink system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser multiple-input multiple-output","up-link","nonlinear power amplifier","hardware impairments","Buss-gang\u2019s theorem","and linear receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Distortion-Aware Linear Receivers in Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877331/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079548","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Distortion-Aware Linear Receivers in Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"D40_1570554804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084845S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877334,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre M.

However, in remote rural areas, there is still a large number of people that do not have access to Internet broadband. To overcome this issue, a possible strategy is to exploit the excellent propagation conditions of very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF) bands by allowing a secondary spectrum reuse in the TV white space (TVWS) channels. But for that, a reliable channel model is required to perform valid coverage and capacity prediction studies. In this paper, a channel model is proposed that takes into account large and small scale fading effects, as well as the particularities of such remote rural areas. The proposed model is simple to implement and can be used to provide fast link-level and system-level simulations. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the model and a capacity evaluation is done considering single input single output (SISO) and different multiple input multiple output (MIMO) configurations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDL-based Channel Model for 5G MIMO Systems in Remote Rural Areas","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877334","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877334.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"CDL-based Channel Model for 5G MIMO Systems in Remote Rural Areas","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877334/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079516","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDL-based Channel Model for 5G MIMO Systems in Remote Rural Areas","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"5_1570552682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090353S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8877345,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Hence, the number of angles of arrivals with significant components is limited. Due to severe path losses, the receiver must be equipped with an antenna array capable of forming narrow beams. The channel estimation with narrow beams is challenging. Algorithms developed for sparse estimation problems can be utilized to overcome the problem. In this paper, the performance and computational complexity of channel estimation methods for millimeter and terahertz frequency bands are compared. The methods considered are based on Bayesian learning with the relevance vector machine, orthogonal matching pursuit and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator optimization. The conventional least squares channel estimator is used as a reference method. The complexity of the least squares estimator is found to be the smallest. The estimation accuracy of the Bayesian learning based estimator is the best but with increased computational complexity.","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877352.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"297","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation Algorithms for Hybrid Antenna Arrays: Performance and Complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation Algorithms for Hybrid Antenna Arrays: Performance and Complexity","htmlLink":"/document/8877352/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19079528","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation Algorithms for Hybrid Antenna Arrays: Performance and Complexity","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"E56_1570549637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105773S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8877353,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Yaoumi","affiliation":["IMT Atlantique, Lab-STICC, UMR CNRS 6285, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Yaoumi","id":"37087045972"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Leduc-Primeau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Leduc-Primeau","id":"38273560300"},{"name":"Elsa Dupraz","affiliation":["IMT Atlantique, Lab-STICC, UMR CNRS 6285, France"],"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Dupraz","id":"37972950700"},{"name":"Frederic Guilloud","affiliation":["IMT Atlantique, Lab-STICC, UMR CNRS 6285, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Guilloud","id":"37589576800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877353","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Energy consumption","Optimization","Signal to noise ratio","Error probability","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","energy consumption","evolutionary computation","iterative methods","parity check codes","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization problem","decoder energy consumption","protograph LDPC codes","LDPC decoders","quantized Min-Sum decoder","differential evolution"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the optimization of the energy consumption of LDPC decoders.

The main ingredient allowing FD is Self Interference Cancellation (SIC). To reach the required high level of SIC, normally several SIC techniques need to be combined, such as antenna isolation or circulator attenuation, analog and digital SIC. Some of these techniques, esp. analog SIC, do not scale well with the number of antennas as required for Massive MIMO. In this paper we consider two promising directions, namely Hybrid SIC (HSIC), and MIMO SI Nulling (SIN), which is based on separate transmit and receive antenna arrays. HSIC can be realized with a number of SIC branches that scale linearly with the number of antennas. On the other hand, the MIMO SI channel can be designed to be of reduced rank, leading to reduced zero-forcing requirements for MIMO SIN. Both HSIC and MIMO SIN can be combined with digital SIC which does not introduce additional hardware. In this paper we present simulation and measurement results to capture some of the characteristics of both approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877362","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Massive MIMO In-Band Full Duplex Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Massive MIMO In-Band Full Duplex Radio","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877362/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079574","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877362/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Massive MIMO In-Band Full Duplex Radio","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"A14_1570559464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086069S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877367,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Bakhshzad Mahmoodi","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Hamidreza Bakhshzad","lastName":"Mahmoodi","id":"37087054588"},{"name":"Jarkko Kaleva","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarkko","lastName":"Kaleva","id":"38229960800"},{"name":"Antti T\u00f6lli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"T\u00f6lli","id":"37284723300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2527-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2528-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"8877367","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877367","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Downlink","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Array signal processing","Interference","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cache storage","computational complexity","multicast communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content delivery performance","computational complexity","complexity reduction","multicast beamforming","local cache content exchange","transmission phase","D2D sub-phase","adjacent users","downlink sub-phase","Base station","detailed complexity analysis","downlink multicast beamformer design","content requests","D2D aided beamforming scheme"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877367","publicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864033/8877095/08877367.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity Reduction in Multicast Beamforming for D2D Assisted Coded Caching","abstract":"A novel D2D aided beamforming scheme is proposed, where the local cache content exchange among nearby users is exploited. The transmission phase is split into two sub-phases: local D2D content exchange and downlink transmission. In the D2D sub-phase, users can autonomously share content with the adjacent users. In the downlink sub-phase, the Base station (BS) simultaneously serves some number of users to fulfill their remaining content requests by utilizing multicast beamforming. We first explain the main procedure via two simple examples and show the complexity involved in beamformer design. Then, we present the general formulation and detailed complexity analysis. We show analytically that, by exploiting the D2D exchange, the complexity of downlink multicast beamformer design can be greatly decreased. This provides significantly enhanced overall content delivery performance in terms of computational complexity and total delivery time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877367/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19079532","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877367/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Complexity Reduction in Multicast Beamforming for D2D Assisted Coded Caching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity Reduction in Multicast Beamforming for D2D Assisted Coded Caching","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"D46_1570554819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096617S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864033","isNumber":"8877095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8877095","articleId":"8877367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877380,"authors":[{"name":"Abraham Montoya Obeso","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo de Tecnolog\u00eda Digital, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Tijuana, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Abraham Montoya","lastName":"Obeso","id":"37086594378"},{"name":"Jenny Benois-Pineau","affiliation":["Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France"],"firstName":"Jenny","lastName":"Benois-Pineau","id":"38277595200"},{"name":"Mireya Sara\u00ed Garc\u00eda V\u00e1zquez","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo de Tecnolog\u00eda Digital, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Tijuana, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Mireya Sara\u00ed Garc\u00eda","lastName":"V\u00e1zquez","id":"37087053176"},{"name":"Alejandro A.

To implement it on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), the state of the art offers two completely different methods: one relying on bit shifts and additions/subtractions, and another one using look-up tables and additions. So far, it was unclear which method performs best for a given constant and input/output data types. The main contribution of this work is a thorough comparison of both methods in the main application contexts of constant multiplication: filters, signal-processing transforms, and elementary functions. Most of the previous state of the art addresses multiplication by an integer constant. This work shows that, in most of these application contexts, a formulation of the problem as the multiplication by a real constant allows for more efficient architectures. Another contribution is a novel extension of the shift-and-add method to real constants. For that, an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation is proposed, which truncates each component in the shift-and-add network to a minimum necessary word size that is aligned with the approximation error of the coefficient. All methods are implemented within the open-source FloPoCo framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Table-Based versus Shift-And-Add Constant Multipliers for FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2019.00037","startPage":"151","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2019.00037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877381","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 26th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 26th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864032/8877381/08877383.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Table-Based versus Shift-And-Add Constant Multipliers for FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877383/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Jun 2019","accessionNumber":"19079461","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Table-Based versus Shift-And-Add Constant Multipliers for FPGAs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"336600a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137124S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864032","isNumber":"8877381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864032","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8877381","articleId":"8877383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877390,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Burgess","affiliation":["Architecture and Technology Group, Arm Ltd, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Burgess","id":"37322624700"},{"name":"Jelena Milanovic","affiliation":["Architecture and Technology Group, Arm Ltd, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Milanovic","id":"37087049361"},{"name":"Nigel Stephens","affiliation":["Architecture and Technology Group, Arm Ltd, France"],"firstName":"Nigel","lastName":"Stephens","id":"37087050468"},{"name":"Konstantinos Monachopoulos","affiliation":["ML Group, Arm Ltd, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Monachopoulos","id":"37087053939"},{"name":"David Mansell","affiliation":["ML Group, Arm Ltd, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mansell","id":"37087050157"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3366-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3367-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-2265"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"8877390","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Training","Error analysis","Digital arithmetic","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bfloat16 processing","high-performance processing","Neural Network accelerators","BF16 multiply-accumulation operation","low-cost hardware implementations","nonstandard rounding mode","IEEE exception flags","network-level accuracy","IEEE single-precision arithmetic","neural networks","IEEE floating-point standard features","FP32","GPU architectures","CPU architectures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["floating-point, rounding mode, neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877390","abstract":"Bfloat16 (\"BF16\") is a new floating-point format tailored specifically for high-performance processing of Neural Networks and will be supported by major CPU and GPU architectures as well as Neural Network accelerators.

As of now, some works have tackled this problem, developing ad-hoc architectures and reaching overall good generalization performances. In this work we try to understand to what extent state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for image classification are able to deal with a challenging abstract problem, the so-called same-different task. This problem consists in understanding if two random shapes inside the same image are the same or not. A recent work demonstrated that simple convolutional neural networks are almost unable to solve this problem. We extend their work, showing that ResNet-inspired architectures are able to learn, while VGG cannot converge. In light of this, we suppose that residual connections have some important role in the learning process, while the depth of the network seems not so relevant. In addition, we carry out some targeted tests on the converged architectures to figure out to what extent they are able to generalize to never seen patterns. However, further investigation is needed in order to understand what are the architectural peculiarities and limits as far as abstract reasoning is concerned.","doi":"10.1109/CBMI.2019.8877412","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing (CBMI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing (CBMI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863324/8877378/08877412.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMI.2019.8877412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing Deep Neural Networks on the Same-Different Task","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877412/","displayDocTitle":"Testing Deep Neural Networks on the Same-Different Task","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19079146","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing Deep Neural Networks on the Same-Different Task","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04402S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","isNumber":"8877378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863324","articleId":"8877412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877418,"authors":[{"name":"Shiho Moriai","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Koganei, Japan"],"firstName":"Shiho","lastName":"Moriai"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3366-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3367-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-2265"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"8877418","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Deep learning","Digital arithmetic","Encryption","Information and communication technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","data analysis","data privacy","financial data processing","fraud","neural nets","regression analysis","social sciences computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving deep learning","additively homomorphic encryption","social challenges","fourth industrial revolution","Big Data","social life","Society 5.0","super-smart society","privacy-preserving logistic regression","privacy-preserving financial data analytics systems","IoT","JST CREST AI","privacy issues","financial institutions"]}],"abstract":"We aim at creating a society where we can resolve various social challenges by incorporating the innovations of the fourth industrial revolution (e.g. IoT, big data, AI, robot, and the sharing economy) into every industry and social life. By doing so the society of the future will be one in which new values and services are created continuously, making people's lives more conformable and sustainable. This is Society 5.0, a super-smart society. Security and privacy are key issues to be addressed to realize Society 5.0. Privacy-preserving data analytics will play an important role. In this talk we show our recent works on privacy-preserving data analytics such as privacy-preserving logistic regression and privacy-preserving deep learning. Finally, we show our ongoing research project under JST CREST \u201cAI\u201d. In this project we are developing privacy-preserving financial data analytics systems that can detect fraud with high security and accuracy. To validate the systems, we will perform demonstration tests with several financial institutions and solve the problems necessary for their implementation in the real world.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning via Additively Homomorphic Encryption","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 26th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2019.00047","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 26th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864032/8877381/08877418.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2019.00047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning via Additively Homomorphic Encryption","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Jun 2019","accessionNumber":"19079438","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning via Additively Homomorphic Encryption","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"336600a198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018759S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2019","isNumber":"8877381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864032","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8877418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877425,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Serre","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Serre","id":"37086154932"},{"name":"Markus P\u00fcschel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"P\u00fcschel","id":"37284075500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3366-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3367-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-2265"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"8877425","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877425","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DSL","Hardware","Generators","Optimization","Sorting","Random access memory","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","electronic engineering computing","embedded systems","fast Fourier transforms","microprocessor chips","object-oriented programming","signal processing","sorting","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSL-based modular IP core generators","hardware generator","signal processing algorithms","processing elements","design space","hardware implementations","embedded domain-specific languages","hardware reuse","Scala type system","FFT","fast Fourier transform","sorting networks","arithmetic formats"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware generator","Streaming hardware","Domain specific language","Staging","FFT"]}],"abstract":"We present a hardware generator for signal processing algorithms that consist of a network of small processing elements, including the fast Fourier transform and sorting networks.

However, due its non-positional nature, modular reductions, required for example by Elliptic Curve (EC) Cryptography (ECC), become costlier. Traditional approaches to RNS modular reduction resort to the Montgomery algorithm, underpinned by large basis extensions. Recently, Hybrid-Positional Residue Number Systems (HPRs) have been proposed, providing a trade-off between the efficiency of RNS and the flexibility of positional number representations. Numbers are represented in a positional representation with the coefficients represented in RNS. By crafting primes of a special form, the complexity of reductions modulo those primes is mitigated, relying on extensions of smaller bases. Due to the need of crafting special primes, this approach is not directly extensible to group operations over currently standardised elliptic curves. In this paper, the Hybrid-Polynomial Residue Number System (HyPoRes) is proposed, enabling for improved modular reductions for any prime. Experimental results show that the modular reduction of HyPoRes, although at most 1.4 times slower than HPR for HPR-crafted primes, is up to 1.4 times faster than a generic RNS approach for primes of ECC standards.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Jun 2019","accessionNumber":"19079444","htmlLink":"/document/8877428/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2019","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HyPoRes: An Hybrid Representation System for ECC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HyPoRes: An Hybrid Representation System for ECC","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"336600a207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068044S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864032","isNumber":"8877381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864032","xplore-issue":"8877381","articleId":"8877428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877441,"authors":[{"name":"David Lutz","affiliation":["ARM Austin Design Center"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lutz","id":"37352907300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3366-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3367-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-2265"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"8877441","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARM Floating Point 2019: Latency, Area, Power","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 26th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864032/8877381/08877441.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 26th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2019.00025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877381","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2019.00025","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Digital arithmetic","Pipelines","Standards","Microarchitecture","Security","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","floating point arithmetic","random number generation","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARM floating point 2019","CPU datapaths","binary64 floating-point","2+2-cycle FMA","in-order vector reduction","bfloat16","datapath logic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877441","abstract":"We have had little or no speed increase from process in the past few years, but latency continues to decrease due to algorithmic improvements [1] and a decision to spend more area on CPU datapaths [2].

In this paper, we propose a novel Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on 3D Multi-scale Feature (3DMF) blocks and Gated Recurrent Fusion Unit (GRFU). Hippocampal Volumes Of Interest (VOI) are used as input. The method is applied on sMRI imaging modality standard for patients screening. First, multiscale features are extracted via 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). They are then taken as input to Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for performance improvement. Extensive experiments are performed on the public Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our 3DMF model combined with GRFU obtains the state-of-the-art performance compared with the existing conventional methods. Furthermore, proposed approach yields a significant enhancement in terms of avoiding high similarity between classes and overfitting issue. Hence, our proposed CAD has the potential to significantly improve the conventional recognition and classification strategies for use in clinical applications.","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing (CBMI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing (CBMI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8863324/8877378/08877477.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease on sMRI based on 3D Multi-Scale CNN Features and a Gated Recurrent Fusion Unit","doi":"10.1109/CBMI.2019.8877477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMI.2019.8877477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease on sMRI based on 3D Multi-Scale CNN Features and a Gated Recurrent Fusion Unit","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19128313","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease on sMRI based on 3D Multi-Scale CNN Features and a Gated Recurrent Fusion Unit","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052913S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2019","isNumber":"8877378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8863324","articleId":"8877477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877613,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandr Laruhin","affiliation":["Intelegent Grids, Ltd, Chebossary, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexandr","lastName":"Laruhin","id":"37087053400"},{"name":"Maxim Nikandrov","affiliation":["Intelegent Grids, Ltd, Chebossary, Russia"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Nikandrov","id":"37087054342"},{"name":"Leonid Slavutskii","affiliation":["Chuvash state University, Chebossary, Russia"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Slavutskii","id":"37087045776"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1743-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1742-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1744-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8877613","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transformers","Protective relaying","Computer crime","Mathematical model","Power engineering","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer crime","data mining","data structures","information networks","power engineering computing","power system protection","recurrent neural nets","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay protection operation","digital network model","power facility","anomalous modes","secondary equipment","electric power industry","adaptive neuro algorithms","information networks","information exchange","network hacking","virus attacks","modern security systems","automated control systems","data structure","artificial neural networks","recurrent neural network","information support","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["secondary equipment","anomaly recognition","adaptive algorithms","neural networks"]}],"abstract":"Secondary equipment of electric power industry and its information networks require protection from disruptions in information exchange, network hacking and virus attacks. Modern security systems used for this purpose may not be effective enough and require continuous improvement. Detection of anomalies in information flows during the operation of secondary equipment of the power facility (automated control systems and relay protection) is becoming an increasingly important task. The identification of such anomalies can be based on statistical outliers analysis, but the use of data mining (DM) techniques to detect \u201cnovelty\u201d in the data structure and system parameters can be a much more effective tool. It is proposed to use the apparatus of artificial neural networks (ANN) as one of the key tools of DM and, specifically, recurrent neural network with LSTM (Long short-term memory) architecture. To detect anomalies in the information support of secondary equipment of the power facility, training of ANN is con-ducted on the maximum possible number of normal modes. At the same time, emergency modes with adequate relay protection operation are also considered as normal. It is shown that the data for ANN training can be obtained on a laboratory bench consisting of a digital network model and a mathematical model of the power unit of the power facility.","doi":"10.1109/URALCON.2019.8877613","publicationTitle":"2019 International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Ural Conference on Electrical Power Engineering (UralCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8864962/8877608/08877613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URALCON.2019.8877613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877608","startPage":"399","endPage":"403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous Modes Recognizing Secondary Equipment in Electric Power Industry: Adaptive Neuro Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous Modes Recognizing Secondary Equipment in Electric Power Industry: Adaptive Neuro Algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877613/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19080027","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877613/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous Modes Recognizing Secondary Equipment in Electric Power Industry: Adaptive Neuro Algorithms","confLoc":"Chelyabinsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066932S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8864962","isNumber":"8877608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8864962","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877608","articleId":"8877613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877655,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir V.

In this work, we present a simple and intuitive method for multi-oriented text detection where each location of feature maps only associates with one reference box. The idea is inspired from the two-stage R-CNN framework that can estimate the location of objects with any shape by using learned proposals. The aim of our method is to integrate this mechanism into a one-stage detector and employ the learned anchor which is obtained through a regression operation to replace the original one into the final predictions. Based on RetinaNet, our method achieves competitive performances on several public benchmarks with a totally realtime efficiency (26.5fps at 800p), which surpasses all of anchor-based scene text detectors. In addition, with less attention on anchor design, we believe our method is easy to be applied on other analogous detection tasks.

We address these challenges in the context of autonomous, vision-based drone racing in dynamic environments. A racing drone must traverse a track with possibly moving gates at high speed. We enable this functionality by combining the performance of a state-of-the-art planning and control system with the perceptual awareness of a convolutional neural network. The resulting modular system is both platform independent and domain independent: it is trained in simulation and deployed on a physical quadrotor without any fine-tuning. The abundance of simulated data, generated via domain randomization, makes our system robust to changes of illumination and gate appearance. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on the task of agile drone flight. We extensively test the precision and robustness of our system, both in simulation and on a physical platform, and show significant improvements over the state of the art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877728/","volume":"36","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8877728/","accessionNumber":"19321098","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Drone Racing: From Simulation to Reality With Domain Randomization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Intel Network on Intelligent Systems"},{"fundingName":"Swiss National Center of Competence Research Robotics"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung"},{"fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation European Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Drone Racing: From Simulation to Reality With Domain Randomization","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"tro-loquercio-2942989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113245S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"8984601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8984601","articleId":"8877728","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8877730,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco D'Agostino","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"D'Agostino","orcid":"0000-0003-2529-8811","id":"37330284000"},{"name":"Flaminio Ferrara","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"firstName":"Flaminio","lastName":"Ferrara","orcid":"0000-0002-3286-0879","id":"37294026000"},{"name":"Claudio Gennarelli","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Gennarelli","orcid":"0000-0003-3090-9656","id":"37294026900"},{"name":"Rocco Guerriero","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"firstName":"Rocco","lastName":"Guerriero","orcid":"0000-0002-4966-6343","id":"37302875500"},{"name":"Massimo Migliozzi","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Migliozzi","orcid":"0000-0001-8161-3121","id":"37313360400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"8877730","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877730","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Antenna measurements","Antennas","Probes","Bandwidth","Open systems","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antenna testing","electromagnetic fields","interpolation","sampling methods","scanning antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gathered NR probe voltage samples","sampling expansion","NR sampling representations","spherical NFTFFT","NF data","NF measurements","scan sphere centers coincide","onset mounting case","near-field data","nonredundant amount","efficient spherical near-field-to-far-field transformation","spherical near-field facility","elongated antenna","offset mounting","nonredundant sampling representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna measurement techniques","near-field-to-far-field transformations (NFTFFTs)","nonredundant (NR) sampling representations","offset mounting","spherical scanning"]}],"abstract":"An efficient spherical near-field-to-far-field transformation (NFTFFT), which takes into account the offset mounting of an elongated antenna and employs the same nonredundant (NR) amount of near-field (NF) data as in the onset mounting case, is presented. The interest for this NFTFFT is due to the fact that, for practical reasons, a mounting where the antenna and the scan sphere centers coincide is not always possible. In this case, the amount of NF measurements required by the traditional spherical NFTFFT can significantly increase. In the developed NFTFFT, this drawback has been overcome by accurately recovering these NF data from the gathered NR probe voltage samples through a sampling expansion, attained by suitably using the NR sampling representations and assuming the antenna as enclosed in a prolate spheroid.

This article first reviews the recent studies focusing on applying the fault detection techniques to the IIoT networks. However, we find that numerous studies focus on the resource utilization and workload allocation. The fault detection toward IIoT facilities is still in its immature stage because the existing approaches are not accurate enough for the stringent fault detection in IIoT networks. To this end, we present a novel algorithm, named Gaussian Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBMs)-based deep neural network (DNN), to transform the fault detection into a classification problem. The real trace-driven experiments show that the proposed scheme outperforms other baseline machine learning methods. We anticipate that this article can inspire blooming studies on the related topics of smart IIoT networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Fault Detection for IIoT Facilities Using GBRBM-Based DNN","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948396","startPage":"5713","endPage":"5722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9138535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/9138535/08877731.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Fault Detection for IIoT Facilities Using GBRBM-Based DNN","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8877731/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2020","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2020","accessionNumber":"19768286","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61902445 and 61902236"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"19lgpy222"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China","grantNumber":"2019A1515011798"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Fault Detection for IIoT Facilities Using GBRBM-Based DNN","sourcePdf":"jiot-huang-2948396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092561S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"9138535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9138535","articleId":"8877731","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877732,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/9040688/8877732/wchen-2948433-small.gif","p":["Wei-Yu Chen received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan, in 2014, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2016.

First, we consider a multicell multiuser MIMO system with multiple base stations (BSs) and each BS could serve multiple downlink mobile stations (MSs) simultaneously. Second, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to simultaneously minimize the downlink powers of different groups of cells subject to the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraints. An indirect method is proposed to transform the MOP of multi-objective power minimization design of multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system to a semidefinite programming (SDP)-constrained MOP. In order to efficiently solve the multi-objective power minimization problem with a low computational complexity, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) with modification is proposed to guarantee the global convergence of Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the performance and show the superiority of the proposed multi-objective beamforming green design to minimize the downlink power consumption of MIMO beamforming system in different groups of cells simultaneously.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/9040688/08877732.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2019.2948433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2019.2948433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9040688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Power Minimization Design for Energy Efficiency in Multicell Multiuser MIMO Beamforming System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Array signal processing","Minimization","Power demand","Interference","Pareto optimization","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","computational complexity","evolutionary computation","MIMO communication","minimisation","Pareto optimisation","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective power optimization design","multicell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output beamforming system","energy efficiency","multiple base stations","multiple downlink mobile stations","multiobjective power minimization design","multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","green design","downlink power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization problem (MOP)","multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)","multicell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system","quality of service (QoS)","green communication design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Power Minimization Design for Energy Efficiency in Multicell Multiuser MIMO Beamforming System","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8877732/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19469983","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST-108-2221-E-007-009-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Power Minimization Design for Energy Efficiency in Multicell Multiuser MIMO Beamforming System","sourcePdf":"tgcn-chen-2948433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145683S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"9040688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","xplore-issue":"9040688","articleId":"8877732","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877733,"authors":[{"name":"Shaolin Zhou","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/8656606/8877733/zhou-2948254-small.gif","p":["Shaolin Zhou (M\u201916) received the B.S. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Optics and Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China, in 2011.

The electro-thermal behavior during the RESET phase transition is mimicked using a finite element model. Results indicate that the temperature distribution, potential drop and current density across the active region can be reshaped. Especially, the process of temperature evolution for phase transition is accelerated and thus the PCM cell can be reset under a lower voltage, e.g., from 2.2 V to 1.2 V for our typical configuration with a GST width of 40 nm and heater width of 20 nm. As a result, the lower RESET voltage decreases the leakage current and power consumption, potentially leading to an increased integration level for cross-point

recent years, with the diversity and variability of cancer information, the multi-omics data have been applied in various fields. Many existing models of principal component analysis can only process single data, which makes limitations on cancer research. Therefore, in this paper, a new model called integrative principal component analysis (IPCA) is proposed to achieve the unification of multi-omics data. In addition, in order to preserve the high-order manifold structure between the data, an integrative hypergraph regularization principal component analysis (IHPCA) is further proposed by applying the hypergraph regularization constraint. The effectiveness of IHPCA method is tested on four multi-omics datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than other representative methods on sample clustering and common expression genes (co-expression genes) network analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9108313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2948456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/9108313/08877734.pdf","startPage":"1823","endPage":"1834","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2019.2948456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrative Hypergraph Regularization Principal Component Analysis for Sample Clustering and Co-Expression Genes Network Analysis on Multi-Omics Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","displayDocTitle":"Integrative Hypergraph Regularization Principal Component Analysis for Sample Clustering and Co-Expression Genes Network Analysis on Multi-Omics Data","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8877734/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19843460","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2020","pubMedId":"31634852","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872220 and 61572284"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrative Hypergraph Regularization Principal Component Analysis for Sample Clustering and Co-Expression Genes Network Analysis on Multi-Omics Data","sourcePdf":"jbhi-liu-2948456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102387S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"9108313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9108313","articleId":"8877734","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8877735,"authors":[{"name":"Jessi E.

This work presents a millimeter-wave, radar-based system for performing accurate measurements of arterial pulse waveforms without contacting the region that is pulsing. Electromagnetic and radar-system simulation models are utilized to demonstrate the viability and safety of this approach. This is followed by hardware/software implementation and a study on 12 human subjects. Measured radial arterial waveforms exhibit signal strengths that are well above the noise floor of the system and a morphology that would be expected in an arterial pulse. Finally, comparison of the radar-based signals with a reference tonometer indicates a strong correlation between waveforms, as well as similar spectral signatures. The results observed suggest a millimeter-wave based approach for arterial pulse detection is very promising for future applications in pulse wave analysis and pulse transit time measurement for blood pressure tracking.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2948581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2948581","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8948273/08877735.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8948273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wearable Millimeter-Wave Device for Contactless Measurement of Arterial Pulses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Wearable Millimeter-Wave Device for Contactless Measurement of Arterial Pulses","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19312096","pubMedId":"31634846","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877735/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Infineon Technologies"},{"fundingName":"CardieX"},{"fundingName":"Thiel Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1746660"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wearable Millimeter-Wave Device for Contactless Measurement of Arterial Pulses","sourcePdf":"tbcas-johnson-2948581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09647S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8948273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8948273","articleId":"8877735","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877736,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8877736/qwang-2948367-small.gif","p":["Qiang Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Dalian Jiaotong University, Dalian, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

The major contribution of the paper is the proposal of a deep bidirectional echo state network (DBESN) framework for time series prediction with such incomplete dataset. Instead of data imputation methodology, a bidirectional fusion reservoir is here designed to extract the deep bidirectional feature along with forward and backward time scales, based on which a deep autoencoder echo state network (DAESN) and a deep bidirectional state echo state network (DBSESN) are constructed for the incomplete output and input samples, respectively. As for such two networks, a bidirectional echo state network (BESN) is proposed for connecting them to constitute the DBESN framework for prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, one synthetic time series as well as two real-world industrial datasets are employed to conduct the comparative experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other comparative ones at various missing rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"19087168","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877736/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time Series Prediction With Incomplete Dataset Based on Deep Bidirectional Echo State Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFA0700300"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61833003, 61533005 and 61873048"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"DUT18TD07 and DUT19JC40"},{"fundingName":"Outstanding Youth Sci-Tech Talent Program of Dalian","grantNumber":"2018RJ01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Time Series Prediction With Incomplete Dataset Based on Deep Bidirectional Echo State Network","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2948367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174521S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8877736","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8877737,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangtao Xu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8877737/xu-2948110-small.gif","p":["Jiangtao Xu (M\u201902) received the B.E. degree from Tianjin University, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Tianjin University, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to suppress lags by distinguishing the lag area and calculating ratio of bright to dark part in one trigger interval. The algorithm bases on the sensor's characteristics and image lag principle that the change of light intensity cannot be immediately reflected on the pulse generated from photoelectric accumulation. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified both on the sensor's behavior-level model and the real image sensor. In both experiments the curves of LSF (line spread function) and MTF (modulation transfer function) show the reconstructed edges after lag elimination algorithm are similar to the real edges both in sharpness and position. The indexes to evaluate image similarity including LMD (location mean deviation), PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) and SSIM (structural similarity index) improve respectively. In the experiment on sensor's model, when the simulation velocity of edge is low, the algorithm can reconstruct the perfect edges as input images. As velocity increases, the reconstructed edges are still sharp but with slight shifts. In the real experiment to film a turntable with a rotation speed of 6000r/min, the LMD, PSNR and SSIM improve from 22.2833 to 2.5167, 18.2485 to 21.8603 and 0.8345 to 0.9364 respectively.

OrthDNNs are theoretically motivated by generalization analysis of modern DNNs, with the aim to find solution properties of network weights that guarantee better generalization. To this end, we first prove that DNNs are of local isometry on data distributions of practical interest; by using a new covering of the sample space and introducing the local isometry property of DNNs into generalization analysis, we establish a new generalization error bound that is both scale- and range-sensitive to singular value spectrum of each of networks' weight matrices. We prove that the optimal bound w.r.t. the degree of isometry is attained when each weight matrix has a spectrum of equal singular values, among which orthogonal weight matrix or a non-square one with orthonormal rows or columns is the most straightforward choice, suggesting the algorithms of OrthDNNs. We present both algorithms of strict and approximate OrthDNNs, and for the later ones we propose a simple yet effective algorithm called Singular Value Bounding (SVB), which performs as well as strict OrthDNNs, but at a much lower computational cost.

In essence, NFV is about running Network Functions (NFs) as virtualized workloads on commodity hardware. This may optimize deployment costs and simplify the lifecycle management of NFs, but it introduces new fault management challenges and issues.

In this paper, we built a semi-supervised learning based Multi-part Convolutional Neural Network (MP-CNN) that classifies 35,992 animal images from ImageNet into 27 different classes of animals. The proposed model classifies the animals on both generic and fine-grained level. The animal breeds are accurately classified using Multi-part Convolutional Neural Network with a hybrid feature extraction framework of Fisher Vector based Stacked Autoencoder. Furthermore, with Semi-supervised learning based pseudo-labels, the model classifies new classes of unlabeled images too.

Particularly, permissioned blockchain such as Hyperledger Fabric shows great application prospects as the infrastructure of IoT security, credit management, etc. Many cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Oracle and IBM cloud currently provide blockchain as a service, in which tenants can quickly build permissioned blockchain and run smart contract based applications. However, the transactions throughput and scalability in the permissioned blockchain are not ideal, despite many optimization efforts in consensus protocol and parallel chain. Existing solutions still reveals some limitations like excessive CPU scheduling, inefficient block broadcast and high latency of initial blocks synchronization when new nodes join blockchain network. Inspired by the emerging RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) network, we propose BoR, an RDMA-based permissioned blockchain framework. By offloading the block transfer transaction into RDMA NICs, it can increase block broadcast speed and reduce block sync delay. We exploit the RDMA primitives to redesign the block synchronization protocol and accelerate DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus process for higher throughput and lower latency in kernel-bypass manner. As demonstrated in our evaluation with different workloads, BoR with lower CPU utilization significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art EoS blockchain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","volume":"13","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"19551828","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2020","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8877753/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"BoR: Toward High-Performance Permissioned Blockchain in RDMA-Enabled Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873309, 61572137 and 61728202"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Innovation Action Plan Project","grantNumber":"19510710500, 18510760200 and 18510732000"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"17DZ1101000"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BoR: Toward High-Performance Permissioned Blockchain in RDMA-Enabled Network","sourcePdf":"tsc-lu-2948009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138054S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9061109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","xplore-issue":"9061109","articleId":"8877753","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877759,"authors":[{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/9082033/8877759/zhang-2948406-small.gif","p":["Tiankui Zhang (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, BUPT.

In this article, each TD has a certain latency-critical computation task in each time slot to complete. Three computation strategies can be available to each TD. First, each TD can operate local computing by itself. Second, each TD can partially offload task bits to the UAV for computing. Third, each TD can choose to offload task bits to access point via UAV relaying. We propose a new optimization problem formulation that aims to minimize the total energy consumption including communication-related energy, computation-related energy and UAV's flight energy by optimizing the bits allocation, time slot scheduling, and power allocation as well as UAV trajectory design. As the formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to find the optimal solution, we propose to solve the problem by two parts, and obtain the near optimal solution by the Lagrangian duality method and successive convex approximation technique, respectively. By analysis, the proposed algorithm can be guaranteed to converge within a dozen of iterations. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the proposed algorithm, which is verified to be efficient and superior to the other benchmark cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","volume":"16","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"19589442","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2020","publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8877759/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Computation and Communication Design for UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing in IoT","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971060 and 61703197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Computation and Communication Design for UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing in IoT","sourcePdf":"tii-xiao-2948406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124811S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"9082033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"9082033","articleId":"8877759","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877761,"authors":[{"name":"Levent E.

Hybrid systems, combining Large-Area Electronics (LAE) and silicon-CMOS ICs to respectively provide diverse sensing and high-performance computation/control, enable a platform for such sensing. A key challenge is that hybrid systems require a large number of interfaces between the LAE and CMOS domains, particularly as the number of sensors scales. This paper presents an architecture that exploits the attribute of signal sparsity, commonly exhibited in large-scale tactile-sensing applications, to reduce the interfacing complexity to a level set by the sparsity rather than the number of sensors. This enhances scalability compared to sequential-scanning and active-matrix approaches. The architecture implements compressed sensing via thin-film transistor (TFT) switches, and is demonstrated in a force-sensing system with 20 force sensors, a TFT die (with 161 ZnO TFTs) per sensor, and a custom CMOS IC for system readout and control.

This can make it difficult to efficiently detect attacks. Visualization to date is mainly used to communicate patterns of raw logs, or to visualize the output of detection systems. In this paper we explore a novel approach to presenting cybersecurity-related information to analysts. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of using visualizations to make analysts become anomaly detectors using Pattern-of-Life Visual Metaphors. Unlike glyph metaphors, the visualizations themselves (rather than any single visual variable on screen) transform complex systems into simpler ones using different mapping strategies. We postulate that such mapping strategies can yield new, meaningful ways to showing anomalies in a manner that can be easily identified by analysts. We present a classification system to describe machine and human activities on a host machine, a strategy to map machine dependencies and activities to a metaphor. We then present two examples, each with three attack scenarios, running data generated from attacks that affect confidentiality, integrity and availability of machines. Finally, we present three in-depth use-case studies to assess feasibility (i.e. can this general approach be used to detect anomalies in systems?), usability and detection abilities of our approach. Our findings suggest that our general approach is easy to use to detect anomalies in complex systems, but the type of metaphor has an impact on user's ability to detect anomalies. Similar to other anomaly-detection techniques, false positives do exist in our general approach as well. Future work will need to investigate optimal mapping strategies, other metaphors, and examine how our approach compares to and can complement existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948490","startPage":"154018","endPage":"154034","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08877786.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Using Pattern-of-Life Visual Metaphors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Visualization","Anomaly detection","Complex systems","Computer security","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal mapping strategies","anomaly-detection techniques","detection abilities","detect anomalies","metaphor","map machine dependencies","host machine","classification system","showing anomalies","different mapping strategies","complex systems","glyph metaphors","anomaly detectors","detection systems","complex dependencies","Pattern-of-Life Visual Metaphors","anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyber security","visualization","anomaly detection","feasibility study","human factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Using Pattern-of-Life Visual Metaphors","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8877786/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"19087619","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010418","fundingName":"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Anomaly Detection Using Pattern-of-Life Visual Metaphors","sourcePdf":"access-happa-2948490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112635S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8877786","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8877818,"authors":[{"name":"Lingwei Xu","affiliation":["Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8877818/xu-2948475-small.gif","p":["Lingwei Xu was born in Shandong, China, in 1987.

In this article the Time-Frequency Packing technique, already successfully proposed for long-haul coherent optical links, is extended to direct-detection systems, based on pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), with the purpose of trading between detection complexity and SE, and of providing performance limits for advanced digital signal processing (DSP) at the receive side.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2019.2948386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8979455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2019.2948386","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8979455/08877820.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Performance Limits for Spectrally Efficient Optical Transmission Techniques in Short-Haul Metro/Access Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"On Performance Limits for Spectrally Efficient Optical Transmission Techniques in Short-Haul Metro/Access Links","volume":"38","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2020","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877820/","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2020","accessionNumber":"19320209","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877820/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Performance Limits for Spectrally Efficient Optical Transmission Techniques in Short-Haul Metro/Access Links","sourcePdf":"jlt-foggi-2948386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090416S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8979455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","xplore-issue":"8979455","articleId":"8877820","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877828,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel R.

The model is trained with the demographic data and medical care information of two population groups: on the one hand, people diagnosed with CKD in Colombia during 2018, and on the other, a sample of people without a diagnosis of this disease. Once the model is trained and evaluation metrics for classification algorithms are applied, the model achieves 95% accuracy in the test data set, making its application for disease prognosis feasible. However, despite the demonstrated efficiency of the neural networks to predict CKD, this machine-learning paradigm is opaque to the expert regarding the explanation of the outcome. Current research on eXplainable AI proposes the use of twin systems, where a black-box machine-learning method is complemented by another white-box method that provides explanations about the predicted values. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has proved to be an ideal complement as this paradigm is able to find explanatory cases for an explanation-by-example justification of a neural network's prediction. In this paper, we apply and validate a NN-CBR twin system for the explanation of CKD predictions.

Here, an attacker sends a high-rate burst of attack packets only after the router buffer is filled with TCP packets, causing the router to drop legitimate packets, and forcing the retransmission of TCP packets. As such, an FB-Shrew attack can cause maximum damage with minimum resources. In this paper, we challenge an assumption of constant round trip time adopted in the original FB-Shrew model. As a result, this model fails to achieve its expected attack effect. In response, we analyze the TCP congestion window and queue behaviors to develop two low-high burst models for maximizing the potency of the FB-Shrew attack. Model 1 is designed to achieve the attack effect expected of the original model. Then, the attack potency of Model 1 is enhanced by simply adjusting the starting time of the attack burst to form Model 2. Mode 1 only exploits the retransmission timeout (RTO) mechanism. Model 2 takes advantage of both the RTO mechanism and the fast retransmission mechanism. In this way, Model 2 further slows down the growth of the congestion window and extends the attack period. A combination of theoretical analyses and simulations are adopted to first validate the proper functioning and effectiveness of the two models for a standard network configuration, and then we assess their attack performances with variations in different network parameters. Our performance assessment demonstrates that one attack unit of Model 2 damages almost twice the number of TCP units as one attack unit of Model 1, which represents an increase in attack potency of nearly 200 percent. The present study provides an expanded basis to explore FB-Shrew attack patterns that may be utilized by attackers. Moreover, the damage that could be inflicted by such attack and the extent to which defense strategies are capable of mitigating the attack's impact could be assessed more precisely by defenders.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9523876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/9523876/08877856.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2019.2948167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2019.2948167","startPage":"2285","endPage":"2300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-High Burst: A Double Potency Varying-RTT Based Full-Buffer Shrew Attack Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877856/","displayDocTitle":"Low-High Burst: A Double Potency Varying-RTT Based Full-Buffer Shrew Attack Model","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877856/","volume":"18","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2021","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601467, U1533107 and U1433105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","grantNumber":"17JCZDJC30900"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3122018C003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low-High Burst: A Double Potency Varying-RTT Based Full-Buffer Shrew Attack Model","sourcePdf":"tdsc-meng-2948167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.212902S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9523876","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","xplore-issue":"9523876","articleId":"8877856","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8877858,"authors":[{"name":"Chintan Thakkar","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8910478/8877858/thakk-2943924-small.gif","p":["Chintan Thakkar (S\u201908\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electronics and electrical communication engineering from IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India, in 2007, and the M.S./Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 2012.","He currently manages the MM-Wave Research Team, PHY Research Lab, Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR, USA.

To this end, the proposed method can save a great amount of time, which will be a more realistic solution for the practical application.

Additionally, since EHR involve patients\u2019 personal privacy information, EHR holders would hesitate to directly outsource their data to cloud servers. A natural and favorite manner of conquering this issue is to encrypt these outsourced EHR such that only authorized medical workers can access them. Specifically, the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) supports fine-grained access over encrypted data and is considered to be a perfect solution of securely sharing EHR in the public cloud. In this paper, to strengthen the system security and meet the requirement of specific applications, we add functionalities of user revocation, secret key delegation and ciphertext update to the original ABE, and propose a revocable-storage hierarchical attribute-based encryption (RS-HABE) scheme, as the core building of establishing a framework for secure sharing of EHR in public cloud. The proposed RS-HABE scheme features of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">forward security</i>\n (a revoked user can no longer access previously encrypted data) and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">backward security</i>\n (a revoked user also cannot access subsequently encrypted data) simultaneously, and is proved to be selectively secure under a complexity assumption in bilinear groups, without random oracles. The theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed scheme surpasses existing similar works in terms of functionality and security, at the acceptable cost of computation overhead. Moreover, we implement the proposed scheme and present experiments to demonstrate its practicability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877867/","volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8877867/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RS-HABE: Revocable-Storage and Hierarchical Attribute-Based Access Scheme for Secure Sharing of e-Health Records in Public Cloud","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702549, 61960206014, 61822202 and 61872449"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005320","fundingName":"Xidian University","grantNumber":"ISN19-12"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RS-HABE: Revocable-Storage and Hierarchical Attribute-Based Access Scheme for Secure Sharing of e-Health Records in Public Cloud","sourcePdf":"tdsc-wei-2947920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.268309S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9523876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9523876","articleId":"8877867","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8877874,"authors":[{"name":"Himank Gupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4275028/9032249/8877874/gupta-2948457-small.gif","p":["Himank Gupta received the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree in computer science and engineering from the G.

The base station (gNodeB) of 5G is segregated into cost-efficient Central Units (CU) hosted on virtual platforms and cheaper & smaller Distributed Units (DU) present at the cell sites. Multiple CUs are pooled together in a single powerful central cloud, known as CU pool. The logical connection between DU and CU can be dynamically adjusted and can potentially affect the energy consumption of the CU pool. The deployment of NG-RAN imposes strict latency requirements on the fronthaul link that connects DUs to CU. To relax these strict latency requirements, various alternate architectures such as Flexible RAN Functional Splits have been proposed by 3GPP. In this paper, we first evaluate the energy consumption of DU and CU for various functional split options using OpenAirInterface (OAI), a real-time open source software radio solution. We find that lower layer splits have high energy consumption at CU as compared to higher layer split options. We also observe the variation in energy consumption due to traffic heterogeneity. Motivated by the above study, we formulate an optimization model, Apt-RAN, that optimizes the energy consumption of the CU pool and the number of handovers, considering different functional splits. To address the computational complexity of solving the optimization model, a lightweight polynomial time heuristic algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-art schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9032249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/9032249/08877874.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2019.2948457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2019.2948457","startPage":"473","endPage":"487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Apt-RAN: A Flexible Split-Based 5G RAN to Minimize Energy Consumption and Handovers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877874/","displayDocTitle":"Apt-RAN: A Flexible Split-Based 5G RAN to Minimize Energy Consumption and Handovers","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8877874/","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19449400","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2020","publicationDate":"March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"project CCRAN: Energy Efficiency in Converged Cloud Radio Next Generation Access Network, Intel India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Apt-RAN: A Flexible Split-Based 5G RAN to Minimize Energy Consumption and Handovers","sourcePdf":"tnsm-gupta-2948457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.215225S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"9032249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"9032249","articleId":"8877874","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8877876,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwei Hu","affiliation":["Division of Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/8989854/8877876/hu-2948323-small.gif","p":["Jingwei Hu received the BSc degree in electronic engineering from Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, in 2011, and the MEng degree in computer engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, in 2014, and the PhD degree in electronic engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2018.

Existing implementations focus on high speed while few of them take into account area or power efficiency, which are particularly decisive for low-cost or power constrained IoT applications. The solution we propose aims at maximizing the metric of area efficiency by rotating the QC-LDPC code representations amongst the block RAMs in digit level. Moreover, optimized parallelized computing techniques, lazy accumulation and block partition are exploited to improve key decapsulation in terms of area and timing efficiency. We show for instance that our area-optimized implementation for 128-bit security requires 6.82 x 105 cycles and 2.26 x 106 cycles to encapsulate and decapsulate a shared secret, respectively. The area-optimized design uses only 39 slices (3 percent of the available logic) and 809 slices (39 percent of the available logic) for key encapsulation and key decapsulation respectively, on a small-size low-end Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2019.2948323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2019.2948323","startPage":"327","endPage":"341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/8989854/08877876.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8989854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight Key Encapsulation Using LDPC Codes on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight Key Encapsulation Using LDPC Codes on FPGAs","volume":"69","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2020","accessionNumber":"19377848","publicationDate":"1 March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8877876/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Ministry of Education - Singapore","grantNumber":"MOE2016-T2-2-014(S)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight Key Encapsulation Using LDPC Codes on FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tc-hu-2948323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.419229S","chronDate":"March 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8989854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8989854","articleId":"8877876","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8877878,"authors":[{"name":"Jade Hind","affiliation":["LivingLens Limited Company, 49 Liverpool, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/9216708/8877878/hind-2948330-small.gif","p":["Jade Hind received the PhD degree in analysis of genetic data from Liverpool John Moores University in 2018.

Epistasis is commonly performed as a pairwise or limitless-arity capacity that considers variant networks as either variant vs variant or as high order interactions. This type of analysis extends the number of tests that were previously performed in a standard approach such as Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), in which False Discovery Rate (FDR) is already an issue, therefore by multiplying the number of tests up to a factorial rate also increases the issue of FDR. Further to this, epistasis introduces its own limitations of computational complexity and intensity that are generated based on the analysis performed; to consider the most intense approach, a multivariate analysis introduces a time complexity of O(n!). Proposed in this paper is a novel methodology for the detection of epistasis using interpretable methods and best practice to outline interactions through filtering processes. Using a process of Random Sampling Regularisation which randomly splits and produces sample sets to conduct a voting system to regularise the significance and reliability of biological markers, SNPs. Preliminary results are promising, outlining a concise detection of interactions. Results for the detection of epistasis, in the classification of breast cancer patients, indicated eight outlined risk candidate interactions from five variants and a singular candidate variant with high protective association.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8877878/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2020","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2020","accessionNumber":"20023468","pubMedId":"31634840","volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Detecting Epistasis using Random Sampling Regularisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Detecting Epistasis using Random Sampling Regularisation","sourcePdf":"tcbb-hussain-2948330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142628S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"9216708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","xplore-issue":"9216708","articleId":"8877878","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":8877911,"authors":[{"name":"William Cheng-Chung Chu","affiliation":["Tunghai University"],"bio":{"p":["William Cheng-Chung Chu is a distinguished professor in the Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taiwan.

First, a simple and effective classifier, i.e., the ridge regression for multivariate labels, is extended to its tensorial version by taking advantages of tensorial representation. Then, the discrimination information of different modes is exploited to further strengthen the capacity of the model. Moreover, the model can be simplified and solved easily. Different from traditional tensorial methods, the proposed model can be utilized to capture not only the intrinsic structure of data in a physical sense but also the generalized relationship of data in a logical sense. Our proposed approach is shown to be effective for different classification purposes on a series of instantiations. Specifically, our experiment results with hyperspectral images collected by the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer, the reflective optics spectrographic imaging system and the ITRES CASI-1500 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared to other tensor-based classifiers and multiple kernel learning methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

In contrast to the existing studies where DoS attacks on different channels are the same, the considered attacks compromise each channel independently. Correspondingly, a decentralized event-triggered scheme is adopted based on the tradeoff between the transmission efficiency and tolerable attack intensity with guarantees on the closed-loop stability. Inspired by the Lyapunov theory for switched systems, the proposed stabilization criteria reveals a link between the tolerable attack intensity and the event-triggering parameters. An example is finally provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2019.2944956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/9279348/08877995.pdf","startPage":"4886","endPage":"4895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2019.2944956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9279348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observer-Based Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Denial-of-Service With a Decentralized Event-Triggered Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Observer-Based Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Denial-of-Service With a Decentralized Event-Triggered Scheme","volume":"50","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2020","accessionNumber":"20261721","pubMedId":"31634857","htmlLink":"/document/8877995/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61621004, 61420106016 and 61773097"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011248","fundingName":"Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries","grantNumber":"2018ZCX03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observer-Based Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Denial-of-Service With a Decentralized Event-Triggered Scheme","sourcePdf":"tcyb-yang-2944956-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145747S","chronDate":"Dec.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"9279348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9279348","articleId":"8877995","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8877996,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Yuan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9112796/8877996/yuan-2948413-small.gif","p":["Zhenyu Yuan received the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2014.","Since 2016, he has been an Associate Professor with Northeastern University, Shenyang, China.

Discovering sequences with desired properties has long been an interesting intellectual pursuit. This article puts forth a new paradigm, AlphaSeq, to discover desired sequences algorithmically using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. AlphaSeq treats the sequence discovery problem as an episodic symbol-filling game, in which a player fills symbols in the vacant positions of a sequence set sequentially during an episode of the game. Each episode ends with a completely filled sequence set, upon which a reward is given based on the desirability of the sequence set. AlphaSeq models the game as a Markov decision process (MDP) and adapts the DRL framework of AlphaGo to solve the MDP. Sequences discovered improve progressively as AlphaSeq, starting as a novice, and learns to become an expert game player through many episodes of game playing. Compared with traditional sequence construction by mathematical tools, AlphaSeq is particularly suitable for problems with complex objectives intractable to mathematical analysis. We demonstrate the searching capabilities of AlphaSeq in two applications: 1) AlphaSeq successfully rediscovers a set of ideal complementary codes that can zero-force all potential interferences in multi-carrier code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems and 2) AlphaSeq discovers new sequences that triple the signal-to-interference ratio-benchmarked against the well-known Legendre sequence-of a mismatched filter (MMF) estimator in pulse compression radar systems.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2942951","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/9184294/08877997.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9184294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2942951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","startPage":"3319","endPage":"3333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AlphaSeq: Sequence Discovery With Deep Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8877997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"AlphaSeq: Sequence Discovery With Deep Reinforcement Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8877997/","volume":"31","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8877997/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2020","accessionNumber":"19910002","pubMedId":"31634848","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003802","fundingName":"General Research Funds established under the University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"14200417"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AlphaSeq: Sequence Discovery With Deep Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tnnls-liew-2942951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08008S","chronDate":"Sept.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"9184294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9184294","articleId":"8877997","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878004,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Hui Zhan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/9239417/8878004/zhan-2944873-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Hui Zhan (M\u201913\u2013SM\u201918) received the bachelor\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.","From 2013 to 2015, he was a Lecturer and an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University.

However, similar to the centralized algorithms, DDE also faces the difficulty of strategies' selection and parameters' setting. To deal with such problems effectively, this article proposes an adaptive DDE (ADDE) to relieve the sensitivity of strategies and parameters. In ADDE, three populations called exploration population, exploitation population, and balance population are co-evolved concurrently by using the master-slave multipopulation distributed framework. Different populations will adaptively choose their suitable mutation strategies based on the evolutionary state estimation to make full use of the feedback information from both individuals and the whole corresponding population. Besides, the historical successful experience and best solution improvement are collected and used to adaptively update the individual parameters (amplification factor F and crossover rate CR) and population parameter (population size N), respectively. The performance of ADDE is evaluated on all 30 widely used benchmark functions from the CEC 2014 test suite and all 22 widely used real-world application problems from the CEC 2011 test suite. The experimental results show that ADDE has great superiority compared with the other state-of-the-art DDE and adaptive differential evolution variants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2020","volume":"50","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"20095208","pubMedId":"31634855","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2020","publicationDate":"Nov. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8878004/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Distributed Differential Evolution","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Outstanding Youth Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61822602"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61772207 and 61873097"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team","grantNumber":"2018B030312003"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong\u2013Hong Kong Joint Innovation Platform","grantNumber":"2018B050502006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"NRF-2019H1D3A2A01101977"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Distributed Differential Evolution","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhan-2944873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185402S","chronDate":"Nov.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"9239417","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"9239417","articleId":"8878004","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8878013,"authors":[{"name":"Yingnan Pan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9488259/8878013/pan-2945063-small.gif","p":["Yingnan Pan received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

Previous approaches limit their basic unit to a word for feature extraction because sequence labeling is a tokenlevel task in which labels are annotated word-by-word. However, the text segment is an ultimate unit for labeling, and we are easily able to obtain segment information from annotated labels in a IOB/IOBES format. Most neural sequence labeling models expand their learning capacity by employing additional layers, such as a character-level layer, or jointly training NLP tasks with common knowledge. The architecture of our model is based on the charLSTM-BiLSTM-CRF model, and we extend the model with an additional segment-level layer called segLSTM. We therefore suggest a sequence labeling algorithm called charLSTM-BiLSTMCRF-segLSTMsLM which employs an additional segment-level long short-term memory (LSTM) that trains features by learning adjacent context in a segment. We demonstrate the performance of our model on four sequence labeling datasets, namely, Peen Tree Bank, CoNLL 2000, CoNLL 2003, and OntoNotes 5.0. Experimental results show that our model performs better than state-of-theart variants of BiLSTM-CRF. In particular, the proposed model enhances the performance of tasks for finding appropriate labels of multiple token segments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Context Using Segment-Level LSTM for Neural Sequence Labeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2019.2948773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8938144/08878020.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2019.2948773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8938144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","displayDocTitle":"Learning Context Using Segment-Level LSTM for Neural Sequence Labeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/8878020/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2019","publicationDate":"2020","accessionNumber":"19404841","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"NRF2016M3C4A7952587"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Context Using Segment-Level LSTM for Neural Sequence Labeling","sourcePdf":"taslp-shin-2948773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094279S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8938144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8938144","articleId":"8878020","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878022,"authors":[{"name":"Khurram Shahzad","affiliation":["Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Khurram","lastName":"Shahzad","orcid":"0000-0001-8430-0518","id":"37086234116"},{"name":"Xiangyun Zhou","affiliation":["Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0001-8973-9079","id":"37406420900"},{"name":"Shihao Yan","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Shihao","lastName":"Yan","orcid":"0000-0002-4586-1926","id":"37085496580"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"8878022","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Receivers","Wireless communication","Decoding","Error probability","Detectors","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","fading channels","synchronisation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covert wireless communication","multiantenna adversary","delay constraints","reliable information decoding","quasistatic wireless fading channels","single-antenna adversary","covert throughput","relaxed covertness requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","covert communication","multiple antennas"]}],"abstract":"Covert communication hides the transmission of a message from a watchful adversary, while ensuring reliable information decoding at the receiver, providing enhanced security in wireless communications.

The inverter module, called the mild hybrid starter and generator (MHSG), is integrated with its motor for size/volume reduction. However, the integrated motor-inverter presents supplementary challenges, such as limited cooling capabilities, in addition to the challenges resulting from the elevated voltage of 48 V of the mild hybrid systems. The proposed MHSG power module addresses these challenges. Parallel-connected metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) dies were solder-bonded onto a direct bonded copper (DBC) substrate, and three DBC substrates (providing six legs) were assembled in a custom housing mounted on a forced air cooler. Shunt resistors and surface-mount device components were also soldered onto the DBC substrates. For improved stability and balance, ribbon bonding was used instead of wire bonding, the module components were repositioned, and DBC patterns were adjusted. The aforementioned approaches minimized the parasitic inductance, unbalanced/concentrated current density, and maximum temperature of the 48 V MHSG inverter module. The proposed module was validated through multiphysics finite-element method (FEM) simulations, manufactured prototypes, and experiments, all of which confirmed that the proposed module exhibits the electrical/thermal characteristics required for 48 V integrated MHSG systems.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2019.2948644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2019.2948644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8935346/08878027.pdf","startPage":"11704","endPage":"11713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8935346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DBC-Packaged Inverter Power Module for Integrated Motor-Inverter Design Used in 48 V Mild Hybrid Starter-Generator (MHSG) System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"DBC-Packaged Inverter Power Module for Integrated Motor-Inverter Design Used in 48 V Mild Hybrid Starter-Generator (MHSG) System","volume":"68","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19404550","htmlLink":"/document/8878027/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hyundai Mobis Co., Ltd."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DBC-Packaged Inverter Power Module for Integrated Motor-Inverter Design Used in 48 V Mild Hybrid Starter-Generator (MHSG) System","sourcePdf":"tvt-yoon-2948644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08514S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8935346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8935346","articleId":"8878027","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8878074,"authors":[{"name":"Belal Ali Al-Maytami","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile communication, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","Ibb University, Ibb, Yemen"],"firstName":"Belal Ali","lastName":"Al-Maytami","orcid":"0000-0002-1997-197X","id":"37086687623"},{"name":"Pingzhi Fan","affiliation":["Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Pingzhi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37277801400"},{"name":"Abir Hussain","affiliation":["Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, U.K."],"firstName":"Abir","lastName":"Hussain","orcid":"0000-0001-8413-0045","id":"37286675800"},{"name":"Thar Baker","affiliation":["Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, U.K."],"firstName":"Thar","lastName":"Baker","orcid":"0000-0002-5166-4873","id":"37590423900"},{"name":"Panos Liatsis","affiliation":["Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Panos","lastName":"Liatsis","id":"37086558988"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2169-3536"}],"articleNumber":"8878074","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1696},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/index.html"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"We measuring the performance through three factors Makespan, speedup and efficiency in this work.

Put simply, in a heterogeneous computing system, task scheduling algorithms, which allow the transfer of incoming tasks to machines, are needed to satisfy high performance data mapping requirements. The appropriate mapping between resources and tasks reduces makespan and maximises resource utilisation. In this contribution, we present a novel scheduling algorithm using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based on the Prediction of Tasks Computation Time algorithm (PTCT) to estimate the preeminent scheduling algorithm for prominent cloud data. In addition, the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement with respect to the makespan and reduces the computation and complexity via employing Principle Components Analysis (PCA) and reducing the Expected Time to Compute (ETC) matrix.

In order to provide channel state information for the base station, channel feedback is essential, especially in frequency division duplexing systems. However, in large antenna systems, the size of channel matrix is huge, and the overhead of feedback complete channel is not acceptable. To reduce the feedback overhead for hybrid beamforming, leveraging the property that the millimeter wave path angles of departure vary more slowly than the path gains, we propose a two-timescale hybrid beamforming/combining algorithm for downlink multi-streams millimeter wave systems. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm with perfect channel state information, and the analytical and simulation results show that proposed algorithm can achieve the same performance of full digital singular value decomposition algorithm. We also analyze the rate gap between the proposed algorithm with perfect channel state information and limited feedback. The rate gap caused by quantization of radio frequency and baseband precoder codebooks are decoupled, and the quantization error is analyzed. At last, we provide a closed-form expression of relationship between feedback bits and rate gap.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"153475","endPage":"153488","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08878080.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Two-Timescale Limited Feedback Hybrid Beamforming/Combining Design for Millimeter Wave Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8878080/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Two-Timescale Limited Feedback Hybrid Beamforming/Combining Design for Millimeter Wave Systems","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087385","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China MIIT","grantNumber":"2018ZX03001001-003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Two-Timescale Limited Feedback Hybrid Beamforming/Combining Design for Millimeter Wave Systems","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2948573-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130777S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8878080","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8878081,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8878081/hu-2948639-small.gif","p":["Wei Hu (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetic fields and microwave technology from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2013.

By employing a compact dual-loop antenna element, the proposed array obtains two broad bandwidths of 12.2% and 15.4% for sub-6GHz operation. To reduce the mutual coupling between antenna elements, a novel dual-band decoupling method is proposed by employing a multi-slot structure. The proposed MIMO array achieves 15.5-dB and 19.0-dB isolations across the two operating bands. Furthermore, three decoupling modes generated by different bent slots can be independently tuned. Zero ground clearance is also realized by the coplanar arrangement of the antenna elements and decoupling structures. The proposed MIMO array was simulated, fabricated, and measured. Experimental results agree well with the simulations, showing that the dual-band MIMO array has good impedance matching, high isolation, and high efficiency. In addition, the envelope correlation coefficient and channel capacity are calculated and analyzed to validate the MIMO performance of the 5G terminal array. Such a dual-band high-isolation eight-element MIMO array with zero ground clearance is a promising candidate for 5G or future mobile applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08878081.pdf","startPage":"153910","endPage":"153920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Band Eight-Element MIMO Array Using Multi-Slot Decoupling Technique for 5G Terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Band Eight-Element MIMO Array Using Multi-Slot Decoupling Technique for 5G Terminals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878081/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19087551","htmlLink":"/document/8878081/","volume":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Young Talent Fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China","grantNumber":"20170105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2018JM6038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N032497/1, EP/P015840/1 and EP/S005625/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"RC1902"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Dual-Band Eight-Element MIMO Array Using Multi-Slot Decoupling Technique for 5G Terminals","sourcePdf":"access-hu-2948639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122241S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8878081","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8878084,"authors":[{"name":"Fanbo Wei","affiliation":["Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8878084/wei-2948656-small.gif","p":["Fanbo Wei received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2017.

Network coding (NC) has the advantages of compressing data and high spectral efficiency, and it plays a crucial role in two-way relay networks. However, conventional two-way relay networks suffer from throughput limitations due to the use of OMA scheme. In this paper, we utilize a hybrid concept to design a two-way relaying system (namely Hybrid-TWRS) which combines NOMA and NC. Furthermore, we investigate the size-mismatch problem caused by asymmetric channel in the NOMA scheme and propose a bit-match scheme and a symbol-match scheme based on the Hybrid-TWRS. Theoretical derivation and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method distinctly outperforms both (i) traditional two-way relaying system with OMA in the uplink and NC in the downlink (namely NC-TWRS); and (ii) NOMA-based two-way relaying system (namely NOMA-TWRS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","accessionNumber":"19087223","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2019","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8878084/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Two-Way Relay Networks: A Joint Mechanism Using NOMA and Network Coding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801461 and 61801460"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"XDC02070800"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Municipality of Science and Technology Commission Project","grantNumber":"18XD1404100 and 17QA1403800"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Two-Way Relay Networks: A Joint Mechanism Using NOMA and Network Coding","sourcePdf":"access-hu-2948656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087426S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8878084","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8878085,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Zollner","affiliation":["Bavarian Police Institute for Further Education, Training Institute of the Bavarian Police, Ainring, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Zollner","id":"37087085131"},{"name":"Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo","affiliation":["University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Kim-Kwang Raymond","lastName":"Choo","orcid":"0000-0001-9208-5336","id":"37428299900"},{"name":"Nhien-An Le-Khac","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"Nhien-An","lastName":"Le-Khac","id":"37657837500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2169-3536"}],"articleNumber":"8878085","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1990},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/index.html"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Bitcoin forensics.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"26KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/8600701/8878085/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2948774.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/8600701/8878085/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2948774.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bitcoin","Forensics","Microsoft Windows","Public key","Cryptographic hash function","Browsers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer crime","cryptocurrencies","digital forensics","Internet","Microsoft Windows (operating systems)","online front-ends","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated live forensic","postmortem analysis","Windows systems","forensic acquisition","forensic research","live data forensics","forensic traces","open source tool","Bitcoin clients","Web Wallets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bitcoin forensics","bitcoin web wallet","cryptocurrency forensics","automated forensic process","digital forensics"]}],"abstract":"Bitcoin is popular not only with consumers, but also with cybercriminals (e.g., in ransomware and online extortion, and commercial online child exploitation).

However, there has been limited forensic research of Bitcoin in the literature. The general focus of existing research is on postmortem analysis of specific locations (e.g. wallets on mobile devices), rather than a forensic approach that combines live data forensics and postmortem analysis to facilitate the identification, acquisition, and analysis of forensic traces relating to the use of Bitcoins on a system. Hence, the latter is the focus of this paper where we present an open source tool for live forensic and postmortem analysing automatically.

However, adversarial examples challenge the further deployment and application of DNNs. Analysis has been carried out for studying the reasons of DNNs' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation and focused on model architecture. No research has been done on investigating the impact of optimization algorithms (namely, optimizers in DNNs) employed in training DNN models on models' sensitivity to adversarial examples. This paper aims to study this impact from an experimental perspective. We analyze the sensitivity of a model not only from the aspect of white-box and black-box attack setups, but also from the aspect of different types of datasets. Four common optimizers, SGD, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam, are investigated on structured and unstructured datasets. Extensive experiment results indicate that an optimization algorithm does pose effects on the DNN model sensitivity to adversarial examples. That is, when training models and generating adversarial examples, Adam optimizer can generate better quality adversarial examples for structured datasets, and Adadelta optimizer can generate better quality adversarial examples for unstructured datasets. In addition, the choice of optimizers does not affect the transferability of adversarial examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087376","htmlLink":"/document/8878095/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Assessing Optimizer Impact on DNN Model Sensitivity to Adversarial Examples","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672092"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"2018JBZ103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Assessing Optimizer Impact on DNN Model Sensitivity to Adversarial Examples","sourcePdf":"access-chang-2948658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12592S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8878095","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878111,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Qiu","affiliation":["College of Meteorology and Oceanology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/8977810/8878111/qiu-small.gif","p":["Wei Qiu received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communication engineering from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2008, 2010, and 2014, respectively.

Traditional compressive sensing (CS) based 3-D imaging methods with sparse data convert the 3-D data into a long vector, and then complete the sensing and recovery steps. This 1-D vectorized model, however, faces challenges of high computational complexity and huge memory usage and may not be viable in real applications. In this article, we solve the 3-D sparse imaging problem efficiently in a tensor way. For this aim, we firstly derive the 3-D imaging model from a tensor perspective under some assumptions. Then we review three kinds of sparse data sampling schemes that are common on the existing 3-D compressive radar imaging applications. Subsequently, with the help of prior information hidden in the radar signal, i.e., sparsity and low-rank property, we propose efficient image reconstruction algorithms for different sampling schemes to produce 3-D images with sidelobes and artifacts suppressed significantly. Finally, extensive experiments based on simulated and real-measured datasets are carried out. Results show that the proposed methods can effectively generate competitive images with small reconstruction error even when the data sampling ratio is low, which confirm the validity of proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2019.2948776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2019.2948776","startPage":"263","endPage":"275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8977810/08878111.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8977810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor Representation for Three-Dimensional Radar Target Imaging With Sparsely Sampled Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","displayDocTitle":"Tensor Representation for Three-Dimensional Radar Target Imaging With Sparsely Sampled Data","publicationDate":"2020","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2020","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878111/","accessionNumber":"19351741","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878111/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601484"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor Representation for Three-Dimensional Radar Target Imaging With Sparsely Sampled Data","sourcePdf":"tci-qiu-2948776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087606S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8977810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8977810","articleId":"8878111","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8878115,"authors":[{"name":"Shujun Han","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8935346/8878115/han-2948761-small.gif","p":["Shujun Han (S\u201918) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering and the M.S. degree in electronics and communication engineering both from Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

Due to the close spatial representations on the motor cortex area of the brain, the discrimination of the different motor imagery tasks is challenging. In this paper, phase synchronization information was proposed to classify motor imagery EEG within the same limb. In addition, non-portable was compared with portable EEG acquisition equipment for the purpose of making the brain computer interface (BCI) system more practical. In the non-portable case, the average accuracy of the binary classification and 3-class classification was 60.6% and 42.7%. In the portable case, the average EEG decoding accuracy of 58.5% and 39.9% was achieved for the two and three tasks. Furthermore, in both two cases, different sets of electrode pairs got the similar results. Moreover, we found that the proposed phase information based method was less sensitive to the number of EEG channels and had less performance degradation in portable EEG equipment. These results show it is possible to use phase synchronization information to discriminate different motor imagery tasks within the same limb. Eventually, this will potentially make the control of neuroprosthesis or other rehabilitation device more natural and intuitive.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08878122.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"153842","endPage":"153852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Synchronization Information for Classifying Motor Imagery EEG From the Same Limb","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase Synchronization Information for Classifying Motor Imagery EEG From the Same Limb","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087672","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8878122/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFB1001303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673114, 91648206, 61803201 and 61673105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20170803"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Phase Synchronization Information for Classifying Motor Imagery EEG From the Same Limb","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2948676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092034S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8878122","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878125,"authors":[{"name":"Gauri Jagatap","affiliation":["Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/8977810/8878125/jagat-2948758-small.gif","p":["Gauri Jagatap received the bachelor's degree in electrical and electronics engineering and the master's degree in physics from BITS Pilani University (India) in 2015.

Fourier ptychography is an image acquisition scheme that uses an array of images to produce high-resolution images in microscopy as well as long-distance imaging, to mitigate the effects of diffraction blurring. The number of measurements is typically much larger than the size of the signal (image or video) to be reconstructed, which translates to high storage and computational requirements. The issue of high sample complexity can be alleviated by utilizing structural properties of the image (or video). In this article, we first discuss a range of subsampling schemes which can reduce the amount of measurements in Fourier ptychography setups; however, this makes the problem ill-posed. Correspondingly, we impose structural constraints on the signals to be recovered, to regularize the problem. Through our novel framework of recovery algorithms, we show that one can reconstruct high-resolution images (or video) from fewer samples, via simple and natural assumptions on the structure of the images (or video). We demonstrate the validity of our claims through a series of experiments, both on simulated and real data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8977810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2019.2948758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8977810/08878125.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"357","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2019.2948758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample Efficient Fourier Ptychography for Structured Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","displayDocTitle":"Sample Efficient Fourier Ptychography for Structured Data","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8878125/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2020","accessionNumber":"19351743","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1566281, CCF-1815101 and CCF-1750920"},{"fundingName":"Black and Veatch Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample Efficient Fourier Ptychography for Structured Data","sourcePdf":"tci-jagatap-2948758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120617S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8977810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8977810","articleId":"8878125","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8878127,"authors":[{"name":"Huaijin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, USA","SenseBrain Technology LLC., San Jose, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/8977810/8878127/chen-2948755-small.gif","p":["Huaijin Chen received the B.S. degree (magna cum laude) in imaging science from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA, in 2013, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, in 2016 and 2019, respectively, where he worked with Prof. Ashok Veeraraghavan on leveraging physics-based model for data-driven computational imaging.

In such framework, besides the regular ConvNets responsible for RGB frame inputs, a second network is introduced to handle the temporal representation, usually the optical flow (OF). However, OF or other task-oriented flow is computationally costly, and is thus typically pre-computed. Critically, this prevents the two-stream approach from being applied to reinforcement learning (RL) applications such as video game playing, where the next state depends on current state and action choices. Inspired by the early vision systems of mammals and insects, we propose a fast event-driven representation (EDR) that models several major properties of early retinal circuits: (1) logarithmic input response, (2) multi-timescale temporal smoothing to filter noise, and (3) bipolar (ON/OFF) pathways for primitive event detection. Trading off the directional information for fast speed (>9000 fps), EDR enables fast real-time inference/learning in video applications that require interaction between an agent and the world such as game-playing, virtual robotics, and domain adaptation. In this vein, we use EDR to demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for Atari games, something that has not been possible with pre-computed OF. Moreover, with UCF-101 video action recognition experiments, we show that EDR performs near state-of-the-art in accuracy while achieving a 1,500x speedup in input representation processing, as compared to optical flow.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Retinomorphic Event-Driven Representations for Video Gameplay and Action Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2019.2948755","endPage":"290","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8977810/08878127.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","startPage":"276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2019.2948755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8977810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Retina","Task analysis","Real-time systems","Streaming media","Cells (biology)","Reinforcement learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","convolutional neural nets","image colour analysis","image motion analysis","image recognition","image representation","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","retinal recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical flow","fast retinomorphic event-driven representations","video gameplay","video understanding","video recognition","two-stream networks","ConvNets","RGB frame inputs","task-oriented flow","reinforcement learning","video game playing","fast event-driven representation","early retinal circuits","multitimescale temporal smoothing","event detection","Atari games","UCF-101 video action recognition experiments","noise filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart cameras","retina","real-time systems","streaming media","cells (biology)","reinforcement learning","video signal processing","video"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Retinomorphic Event-Driven Representations for Video Gameplay and Action Recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8878127/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2020","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2020","accessionNumber":"19351745","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF EAGER","grantNumber":"1502875"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1652633"},{"fundingName":"Texas Instruments Distinguished Graduate Student Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"IARPA via DoI/IBC","grantNumber":"D16PC00003"},{"fundingName":"NSF NeuroNex","grantNumber":"DBI-1707400"},{"fundingName":"NSF EAGER","grantNumber":"1502875"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1652633"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Retinomorphic Event-Driven Representations for Video Gameplay and Action Recognition","sourcePdf":"tci-patel-2948755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146366S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8977810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","xplore-issue":"8977810","articleId":"8878127","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8878130,"authors":[{"name":"Irmak Aykin","affiliation":["The University of Arizona, Tucson, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8962108/8878130/aykin-2947938-small.gif","p":["Irmak Aykin received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2012, and the M.S. degree from Bilkent University, in 2014.

In this paper, we propose a communication protocol called SmartLink, which exploits the clustering phenomenon at mmW frequencies to establish a multi-beam link between a base station and a user. By utilizing multiple clusters, SmartLink enables efficient link maintenance and sustained throughput. We develop a logarithmic-time search algorithm called multi-lobe beam search (MLBS), which is used in SmartLink to discover the clusters. MLBS probes several directions simultaneously, using multi-lobe beam patterns. The number of simultaneous lobes is selected to minimize the search time of the clusters. We provide detailed analysis of the false alarm and misdetection probabilities for the designed beam patterns. Following cluster discovery, SmartLink divides antennas into sub-arrays to generate the optimal multi-lobe beam pattern that maximizes the average data rate under blockage. Extensive simulations using actual channel traces obtained by utilizing phased-array antennas at 29 GHz are used to verify the efficiency of SmartLink. MLBS decreases the discovery time by up to 88% compared to common existing search schemes, and exploiting multiple clusters improves the average data rate by 10%.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2947938","startPage":"2772","endPage":"2785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8962108/08878130.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8962108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-beam Transmissions for Blockage Resilience and Reliability in Millimeter-Wave Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Multi-beam Transmissions for Blockage Resilience and Reliability in Millimeter-Wave Systems","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2020","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878130/","accessionNumber":"19348941","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878130/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1409172, CNS-1513649, CNS-1563655, CNS-1731164 and IIP-1822071"},{"fundingName":"Broadband Wireless Access and Applications Center (BWAC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-beam Transmissions for Blockage Resilience and Reliability in Millimeter-Wave Systems","sourcePdf":"jsac-aykin-2947938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135054S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8962108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8962108","articleId":"8878130","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":8878131,"authors":[{"name":"Xinping Yi","affiliation":["The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8960485/8878131/yi-2948638-small.gif","p":["Xinping Yi (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in electronics and communications from T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Paris, France, in 2015.

In this paper, we consider a variant of the TIM problem with uncertainty in network topology, where the channel state with partial connectivity is only known to belong to one of M states at the transmitters. In particular, the transmitter has access to all network topological information over M states, but is unaware of which state it falls in exactly for communication. The receiver at any state is aware of the exact state it falls in besides the network topologies of all states, and wish to recover as much highly-prioritized information at current state as possible. We formulate it as the opportunistic TIM problem with network uncertainty modeled by M state-varying network topologies. To adapt to network topology uncertainty and different message decoding priority, joint encoding and opportunistic decoding are enabled at the transmitters and receivers respectively. Specifically, being aware of all possible network topologies, each transmitter sends a signal jointly encoded from all messages desired over M states, say M distinct messages, and at a certain State m, Receiver k wishes to opportunistically decode the first \u03c0\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n(m) \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , M} higher-priority messages. Under this opportunistic TIM setting, we construct a multi-state conflict graph to capture the mutual conflict of messages over M states, and characterize the optimal DoF region of two classes of network topologies via polyhedral combinatorics. A remarkable fact is that, under an additional mild monotonous condition, the optimality conditions of orthogonal access and one-to-one interference alignment still apply to TIM with uncertainty in network topology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"68","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19266582","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8878131/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Topological Interference Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Topological Interference Management","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yi-2948638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120506S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8960485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8960485","articleId":"8878131","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8878139,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Fan","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8960485/8878139/fan-2948597-small.gif","p":["Ye Fan received the B.S. degree from the Department of Information Engineering, Chang\u2019an University, in 2012, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Increasing the size of the active aperture leads to an increase in the image quality of the ultrasound system at the expense of increased system cost. An alternate approach is to get rid of the requirement of having consecutive active receive elements and instead place them in a random order in a larger aperture. This, in turn, creates an undersampled situation where there are only M active elements placed in a larger aperture, which can accommodate N consecutive receive elements (with M <; N). It is possible to formulate and solve the above-mentioned undersampling situation using a compressed sensing (CS) approach. In our previous work, we had proposed Gaussian undersampling strategy for reducing the number of active receive elements. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, namely Gaussian undersampling-based CS framework (GAUCS) with wave atoms as a sparsifying basis for CFB imaging method. The performance of the proposed method is validated using simulation and in vitro phantom data. Without an increase in the active elements, it is found that the proposed GAUCS framework improved the lateral resolution (LR) and image contrast by 27% and 1.5 times, respectively, while using 16 active elements and by 39% and 1.1 times, respectively, while using 32 active elements. Thus, the GAUCS framework can play a significant role in improving the performance, especially, of affordable point-of-care ultrasound systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/9011693/08878140.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2948652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2948652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9011693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategic Undersampling and Recovery Using Compressed Sensing for Enhancing Ultrasound Image Quality","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Ultrasonic imaging","Finite element analysis","Image quality","Array signal processing","Radio frequency","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","compressed sensing","Gaussian processes","image resolution","image sampling","medical image processing","phantoms","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GAUCS framework","image contrast","point-of-care ultrasound systems","ultrasound image quality","conventional focused beamforming","active aperture size","ultrasound transducer array","ultrasound system","consecutive active receive elements","M active elements","compressed sensing approach","Gaussian undersampling strategy","Gaussian undersampling-based CS framework","CFB imaging method","in vitro phantom data","lateral resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)","Gaussian subsampling","sparse receive","sparse recovery","sparsity","ultrasound"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Muscle, Skeletal","Phantoms, Imaging","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Strategic Undersampling and Recovery Using Compressed Sensing for Enhancing Ultrasound Image Quality","volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8878140/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19445061","pubMedId":"31634832","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India, through the Half-Time Research Assistantship (HTRA) stipend"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology for support through the Fund for Improvement of S & T Infrastructure in Universities and Higher Educational Institutions (FIST)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategic Undersampling and Recovery Using Compressed Sensing for Enhancing Ultrasound Image Quality","sourcePdf":"tuffc-thittai-2948652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114175S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"9011693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9011693","articleId":"8878140","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878146,"authors":[{"name":"Jinping Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8878146/wang-2948627-small.gif","p":["Jinping Wang (M\u201916) was born in Hunan, China, in 1984.

There are DC offset and AC ripple on the neutral-point (NP) voltage when SLMDPWM is used, which causes an appearance of low frequency harmonics (LFHs) in the output voltage. Aiming at this drawback, reduced LFHs (RLFHs) method is then proposed. While using RLFHs, the self-equilibrium ability of NP voltage is thus lost. So, active neutral-point voltage control (ANPVC) is also proposed. The performances of NPC TLI with the proposed DPWM and other DPWMs are compared by simulation and experimental results. The results show that switching loss, LFHs can be reduced significantly and the NP voltage can be controlled within an allowable range. Therefore, the multiple control objectives of reduced switching loss, no LFHs and allowable NP voltage are achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8878146/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19105572","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discontinuous PWM Strategy for Neutral Point Clamped Three-Level Inverter to Achieve Multiple Control Objectives","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"JZ2019HGTB0074 and PA2019GDPK0080"},{"fundingName":"Tianchang-HFUT Industrial Innovation Lead Key Funds Project","grantNumber":"JZ2019AHDS0002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Discontinuous PWM Strategy for Neutral Point Clamped Three-Level Inverter to Achieve Multiple Control Objectives","sourcePdf":"access-wei-2948627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087331S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8878146","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8878148,"authors":[{"name":"Huihui Ma","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Huihui","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0002-9486-1359","id":"37087234325"},{"name":"Haihong Tao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Haihong","lastName":"Tao","id":"37275333800"},{"name":"Jia Su","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Su","id":"37085561979"},{"name":"Bin Liao","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liao","orcid":"0000-0003-4636-4339","id":"37085676037"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8878148","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with vector arrays composed of spatially spread dipole quints. A new method for estimating the azimuth-elevation angles and polarization parameters is devised. Particularly, we first divide both the transmit and receive arrays into five subarrays, then estimate the directions-of-departure (DODs) and directions-of-arrival (DOAs) by making use of the shift invariant properties. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed one does not need to estimate the steering vector of each source. Moreover, it can resolve the targets without the priori knowledge of the dipole quints' spacing. Unlike the MIMO systems with colocated electromagnetic vector sensors, the proposed one can make better use of the spatial diversity of antennas, refine the direction-finding accuracy with fewer antennas, as well as reduce the mutual coupling effect and hardware cost.

Based on the analysis of traditional pulse coupled neural network, the simplified PCNN model based on SCM is designed. In order to highlight the different feature of different modality images, the adaptive parameters of SPCNN are set on the basis of the inherent characteristics of images, and the fused method in NSST is proposed. Firstly, the source image is decomposed by NSST with multiple scales and multiple directions. In the high-frequency coefficients, the SPCNN with adaptive parameters is adopted to calculate the firing time of each coefficient, the high-frequency coefficients are fused by comparing the firing times. In order to protect the details and edge information of the low-frequency coefficients, the combining of regional energy and energy of gradient is regarded as the active level, the low-frequency coefficients is fused by the weighted fusion rule. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by inverse NSST transform. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the other five classical methods, the fused results of the proposed method are consistence in the human visual perception system. The contrast and detail of fused image are perfect.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2019.2948783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2948783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors

the diffraction grating system based on the Terahertz source is expensive and bulky. In this letter, a long-wave infrared source with a wavelength of 10.6 um is used to establish an optical neural network transfer model using the Sommerfeld diffraction theory. Diffraction grating design, processing, and error analysis applied to deep neural networks are carried out. The MNIST handwritten database is used as the data set to train and optimize the phase parameters by forward propagation and backpropagation. The neuron size is 5um; the number of neurons is 200*200; the entire grating area is 1mm. Compared with the existing light diffraction neural network, the feature size of the deep learning neural network is reduced by 80 times. The Ge (Germanium)-based diffraction grating of 5 layers of neurons with four relative step heights is engraved by semiconductor standard processing technology.

Traditional inverse problem solvers minimize a cost function consisting of a data-fit term, which measures how well an image matches the observations, and a regularizer, which reflects prior knowledge and promotes images with desirable properties like smoothness. Recent advances in machine learning and image processing have illustrated that it is often possible to learn a regularizer from training data that can outperform more traditional regularizers. We present an end-to-end, data-driven method of solving inverse problems inspired by the Neumann series, which we call a Neumann network. Rather than unroll an iterative optimization algorithm, we truncate a Neumann series which directly solves the linear inverse problem with a data-driven nonlinear regularizer. The Neumann network architecture outperforms traditional inverse problem solution methods, model-free deep learning approaches, and state-of-the-art unrolled iterative methods on standard datasets. Finally, when the images belong to a union of subspaces and under appropriate assumptions on the forward model, we prove there exists a Neumann network configuration that well-approximates the optimal oracle estimator for the inverse problem and demonstrate empirically that the trained Neumann network has the form predicted by theory.","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2019.2948732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8977810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2019.2948732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8977810/08878159.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neumann Networks for Linear Inverse Problems in Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Neumann Networks for Linear Inverse Problems in Imaging","volume":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878159/","publicationDate":"2020","accessionNumber":"19351747","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878159/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1740707, 1447449 and 0353079"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-18-1-0166"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neumann Networks for Linear Inverse Problems in Imaging","sourcePdf":"tci-gilton-2948732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155106S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8977810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8977810","articleId":"8878159","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8878162,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Dytso","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Alex Dytso is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.

It is well known that, in this case, when n=1 the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete with finitely many mass points, and when n > 1 the capacity-achieving input distribution is supported on finitely many concentric shells. However, due to the previous proof technique, not even a bound on the exact number of mass points/shells was available. This paper provides an alternative proof of the finiteness of the number mass points/shells of the capacity-achieving input distribution while producing the first firm bounds on the number of mass points and shells, paving an alternative way for approaching many such problems. The first main result of this paper is an order tight implicit bound which shows that the number of mass points in the capacity-achieving input distribution is within a factor of two from the number of zeros of the downward shifted capacity-achieving output probability density function. Next, this implicit bound is utilized to provide a first firm upper on the support size of optimal input distribution, an O(A\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) upper bound where A denotes the constraint on the input amplitude. The second main result of this paper generalizes the first one to the case when n > 1, showing that, for each and every dimension n \u2265 1, the number of shells that the optimal input distribution contains is O(A\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n). Finally, the third main result of this paper reconsiders the case n = 1 with an additional average power constraint, demonstrating a similar O(A\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8878162/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2020","publicationDate":"April 2020","accessionNumber":"19469619","volume":"66","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Capacity Achieving Distribution for the Amplitude Constrained Additive Gaussian Channel: An Upper Bound on the Number of Mass Points","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1908308"},{"fundingName":"United States???Israel Binational Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BSF-2018710"},{"fundingName":"United States???Israel Binational Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BSF-2018710"},{"fundingName":"European Union???s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","grantNumber":"694630"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Capacity Achieving Distribution for the Amplitude Constrained Additive Gaussian Channel: An Upper Bound on the Number of Mass Points","sourcePdf":"tit-dytso-2948636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119727S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9039774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9039774","articleId":"8878162","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8878166,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Xiao","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Light Propagation and Transformation, College of Information Science and Technology, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"p":["Qinghua Xiao received the B.S. degree in optical information science and technology from the Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China, in 2016.

We first introduce PS-16 QAM mapping scheme with 16-point constellation reshaped from 32 symbols into splitter-based DMT-WDM-PON. The DMT-WDM-PON employing PS-16 QAM can achieve superior receiver power sensitivity (RPS) and enhanced spectral efficiency (SE) compared with the unshaped one. Compatible with the forward error correction (FEC) implemented in most of the optical transponders today, an optimized bit-interleaved coded modulation iterative decoding (BICM-ID) system based on LDPC coding is proposed to encode the PS-16 QAM DMT signal without any extra shaping codes or overheads. Then the labeling optimization with the assistance of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart is investigated, in which the extrinsic messages are transferred between the PS demapper and the LDPC decoder for retrieving the PS-16 QAM DMT signal. Furthermore, the experimental results show that 1.5-dB RPS improvement and 2-dB fiber nonlinear effect tolerance enhancement are respectively realized over a 20-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) link by using joint applications of DFT-spread scheme and PS-16 QAM mapping in proposed DMT-WDM-PON system, which can thus provide abundant system loss budget for the legacy optical distribution networks (ODNs).","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2019.2948145","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8986818/08878166.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8986818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2019.2948145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DFT-Spread DMT-WDM-PON Employing LDPC-Coded Probabilistic Shaping 16 QAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2020","displayDocTitle":"DFT-Spread DMT-WDM-PON Employing LDPC-Coded Probabilistic Shaping 16 QAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878166/","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2020","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19341673","htmlLink":"/document/8878166/","volume":"38","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401166"},{"fundingName":"Fujian Province Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2016J06015 and 11166004"},{"fundingName":"Quanzhou City Science and Technology Program of China","grantNumber":"2018C116R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DFT-Spread DMT-WDM-PON Employing LDPC-Coded Probabilistic Shaping 16 QAM","sourcePdf":"jlt-dong-2948145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117165S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2020","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8986818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","xplore-issue":"8986818","articleId":"8878166","onlineDate":"21 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-23"},{"_id":8878209,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hsueh Tsai","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hsueh","lastName":"Tsai","orcid":"0000-0002-3168-0892","id":"37085771999"},{"name":"Federico Pepe","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Pepe","orcid":"0000-0002-9555-5775","id":"38246114800"},{"name":"Giovanni Mangraviti","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Mangraviti","orcid":"0000-0001-5134-7205","id":"38233359500"},{"name":"Zhiwei Zong","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Zong","id":"37086640417"},{"name":"Jan Craninckx","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Craninckx","orcid":"0000-0002-3980-0203","id":"37268745200"},{"name":"Piet Wambacq","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Piet","lastName":"Wambacq","id":"37274342300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-9603"}],"articleNumber":"8878209","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":615},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Bandwidth","Jitter","Oscillators","Tuning","Frequency conversion","Frequency synthesizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","circuit tuning","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital phase locked loops","field effect MIMIC","field effect MMIC","jitter","oscillators","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["128 QAM","IEEE-802.11ad","frequency multiplication factor","transformer feedback","jitter performance","tunable source-bridged capacitor","low phase noise","digitally controlled oscillator","PLL bandwidth","mm-wave communication","low-phase-noise bang-bang digital phase-locked loop","millimeter-wave communication","fast-lock bang-bang digital PLL","gear-shift algorithm","RMS jitter","power 25.0 mW","noise figure -239.0 dB","frequency 22.5 GHz to 27.7 GHz","time 780 mus to 45 mus","frequency 60 GHz","PN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast-lock phase-locked loop (PLL)","IEEE 802.11ad","mm-wave"]}],"abstract":"We present a 22.5-27.7-GHz fast-lock low-phase-noise bang-bang digital phase-locked loop (PLL) for mm-wave communication.

Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes in Recognition of Hand-Writing Number","abstract":"Current technological developments spur the application of pattern recognition in various fields, such as the introduction of signature patterns, fingerprints, faces, and handwriting. Human handwriting has differences between one another and often is difficult to read or difficult to recognize and this can hamper daily activities, such as transaction activities that require handwriting. Even though one of the human biometric features is handwriting. The purpose of this paper is to compare the algorithm of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes (GNB) in handwriting number recognition. Both of these algorithms are quite reliable in performing the classification process. ANN can do pattern recognition and provide good results. If the size of the training data is small, the accuracy of GNB provides good results. To recognize the handwriting pattern, the characteristics of the handwriting object are extracted using an invariant moment. The test results show that GNB produces a higher level of accuracy of 28.33% compared to the ANN of 11.67%. The resulting accuracy level is still very low. This is because the result extraction data has a small distance for each class or any number character.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878651/","accessionNumber":"19082476","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878651/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","conferenceDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes in Recognition of Hand-Writing Number","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes in Recognition of Hand-Writing Number","confLoc":"Makassar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"58_1570497030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098452S","chronDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8869568","isNumber":"8878325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869568","xplore-issue":"8878325","articleId":"8878651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8878658,"authors":[{"name":"I Nyoman Gede Arya Astawa","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Politeknik Negeri Bali, Badung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"I Nyoman Gede Arya","lastName":"Astawa","id":"37086875133"},{"name":"I Gusti Ngurah Bagus Caturbawa","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Politeknik Negeri Bali, Badung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"I Gusti Ngurah Bagus","lastName":"Caturbawa","id":"37087058610"},{"name":"Elina Rudiastari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Politeknik Negeri Bali, Badung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Elina","lastName":"Rudiastari","id":"37087056355"},{"name":"Made Leo Radhitya","affiliation":["Technology Informatic STMIK STIKOM Indonesia, Denpasar, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Made Leo","lastName":"Radhitya","id":"37087060121"},{"name":"Ni Kadek Dessy Hariyanti","affiliation":["Bussiness Administration Politeknik Negeri Bali, Badung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ni Kadek Dessy","lastName":"Hariyanti","id":"37086873367"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8050-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8049-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8051-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8878658","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Licenses","Character recognition","Convolutional neural networks","Feature extraction","Training","Databases","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","character recognition","convolutional neural nets","feature extraction","image recognition","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN method","character extraction results","character features","pre-prepared character feature database","license plate recognition","artificial intelligence technology","number plate recognition","Android application","vehicle number plates","deep learning methods","character recognition process","convolutional neural network method implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["number plate","android","character recognition","CNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878658","abstract":"Each vehicle is equipped with an identity in the form of a number plate.

In this study, the character recognition of vehicle number plates using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the deep learning methods. The character recognition process is realized by the segmentation process, which is taking the characters in the number plate. Next is the process of extracting characters with the CNN method. Character extraction results in the form of features. Character features are matched with the pre-prepared character feature database. The test results are very satisfying, which is 94% of the corresponding characters and 6% of characters are not suitable.","doi":"10.1109/EIConCIT.2018.8878658","startPage":"176","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"2018 2nd East Indonesia Conference on Computer and Information Technology (EIConCIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIConCIT.2018.8878658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878325","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 2nd East Indonesia Conference on Computer and Information Technology (EIConCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869568/8878325/08878658.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Method Implementation for License Plate Recognition in Android","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878658/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Method Implementation for License Plate Recognition in Android","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878658/","accessionNumber":"19082515","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","conferenceDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Network Method Implementation for License Plate Recognition in Android","confLoc":"Makassar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"37_1570495419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097696S","chronDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8869568","isNumber":"8878325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869568","xplore-issue":"8878325","articleId":"8878658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878664,"authors":[{"name":"Herman Santoso Pakpahan","affiliation":["Universitas Mulawarman, Samarinda, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Herman Santoso","lastName":"Pakpahan","id":"37086611891"},{"name":"Haviluddin","affiliation":["Universitas Mulawarman, Samarinda, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Haviluddin","id":"37085687497"},{"name":"Masna Wati","affiliation":["Universitas Mulawarman, Samarinda, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Masna","lastName":"Wati","id":"37086353831"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8050-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8049-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8051-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8878664","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878664","abstract":"Geothermal utilization in Indonesia is mostly for electricity generation. Electricity consumption has increased while geothermal production has not increased, so it is necessary to develop geothermal wells. One of the efforts is the prediction of well behavior so that the well performance can be known which a need for well development is. To predict the behavior of geothermal wells temperature prediction (T) and pressure (P) with location parameters (x and y), well depth (z) injection flow rate (qinj) and injection temperature (Tinj) using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. The first is the generation of well production models, M-1, M-2 and M-3, each model has 6 wells. Data is generated during one year of production and data separation is carried out, i.e. data for 11 months is used as ANN training data and data for the last 1 month is used as test data. The results of the prediction with ANN will be compared with the test data. Calculation of errors between the predicted results and the test data on M-1 is 0.0251 for temperature (T) and 0.0303 for pressure (P), while the MSE value is 0.00378. At M-2 is 0.0283 for temperature (T) and 0.0468 for pressure (P), while the MSE value is 0.000795. At M-3 is 0.0445 for temperature (T) and 0.0566 for pressure (P), while the MSE value is 0.0121. Based on the results obtained the error value and MSE are relatively small, so ANN can be used to predict the behavior of geothermal wells. Then the variation in the number of hidden layers is done. H-15 has the best error value and MSE, while h-50 has the best regression value (R).","doi":"10.1109/EIConCIT.2018.8878664","startPage":"330","endPage":"335","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 2nd East Indonesia Conference on Computer and Information Technology (EIConCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869568/8878325/08878664.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 2nd East Indonesia Conference on Computer and Information Technology (EIConCIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIConCIT.2018.8878664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of Geothermal Reservoir Determination using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature distribution","Reservoirs","Production","Data models","Training","Information technology","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","geothermal power stations","mean square error methods","neural nets","power consumption","power engineering computing","regression analysis","reservoirs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geothermal reservoir determination","geothermal utilization","electricity generation","electricity consumption","geothermal production","geothermal wells temperature prediction","injection temperature","artificial neural network method","well production models","ANN training data","MSE value","error value","regression value"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural network","geothermal wells","pressure","temperature"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Geothermal Reservoir Determination using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878664/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","conferenceDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"19082520","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Geothermal Reservoir Determination using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","confLoc":"Makassar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"70_1570502234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050581S","chronDate":"6-7 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8869568","isNumber":"8878325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869568","xplore-issue":"8878325","articleId":"8878664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8878665,"authors":[{"name":"Yulita Salim","affiliation":["Universitas Muslim Indonesia, Makassar, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Yulita","lastName":"Salim","id":"37087058548"},{"name":"Mukhlisulfatih Latief","affiliation":["State University of Gorontalo, Gorontalo, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mukhlisulfatih","lastName":"Latief","id":"37087056524"},{"name":"Novri Kandowangko","affiliation":["State University of Gorontalo, Gorontalo, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Novri","lastName":"Kandowangko","id":"37087060383"},{"name":"Rampi Yusuf","affiliation":["State University of Gorontalo, Gorontalo, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rampi","lastName":"Yusuf","id":"37087061774"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8050-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8049-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8051-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8878665","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Image segmentation","Training","Clustering algorithms","Testing","Thresholding (Imaging)","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image colour analysis","image processing","image segmentation","neural nets","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gorontalo herbal plant image identification system","digital imaging processing method","extraction techniques","thresholding method","extraction process","color characteristics","11 test images","clustering accuracy","artificial neural network algorithm accuracy","case artificial neural networks","K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural network","image processing","K-means"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878665","abstract":"The objective of this study was to analyze the comparison between artificial neural network algorithm and k-means clustering to see the extent of the effectiveness of this algorithm on the identification of Gorontalo herbal plant image.

It is a technological revolution that makes devices smarter, computations intelligent and communications more informative. While IoT still presuming different definitions, its application had set a broader footprint in almost all walks of our daily life. The voluminous amount of data generated by the millions of IoT devices imposes a higher demand on the computation and storage resources. The compute resources to serve the IoT applications need to be chosen depending upon the heterogeneity of the IoT devices. The various constraints of IoT make resource provisioning in the cloud a non trivial task. Fog computing is the apt platform to deal with such constraints of IoT. The IoT challenges like heterogeneity, scalability and low latency can be addressed by fog computing by adapting intelligence features of machine learning in its resource management techniques. In this paper, we propose a resource management technique for fog computing in which an agent adapts centralized learning and distributed scheduling of IoT tasks. This paper considers the micro data center as the resource that have the hardware and software capability to use TCP/IP protocol suite in fog computing paradigm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8870340/8878677/08878821.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)","doi":"10.1109/ICSCAN.2019.8878821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCAN.2019.8878821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Agent based Resource Provision for IoT through Machine Learning in Fog Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet of Things","Edge computing","Cloud computing","Resource management","Containers","Computer architecture","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-agent systems","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT devices","machine learning","resource management technique","IoT tasks","fog computing paradigm","storage resources","IoT applications","agent based resource provision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog computing","Virtual containers","Reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"An Agent based Resource Provision for IoT through Machine Learning in Fog Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878821/","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"19082768","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Agent based Resource Provision for IoT through Machine Learning in Fog Computing","confLoc":"Pondicherry, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCAN_2019_paper_114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063228S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8870340","isNumber":"8878677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8870340","xplore-issue":"8878677","articleId":"8878821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878833,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a key component of the LTE wireless system, the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna has attracted significant research power in the recent years for its well-known advantages of increasing transmission capacity and reducing multipath fading. A MIMO antenna consists of at least two radiating elements placed at certain distance to have high isolation between them, but the available space is very limited in the modern portable wireless front-ends. Various techniques have been proposed to improve isolation in MIMO antenna for LTE application. Mutual coupling between the perpendicularly placed antennas can be reduced by using narrow stubs in the ground plane and slots in the radiating elements. The designed antenna has simple structure and compact size of 50 X 20 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

This work employs a soft-computing assisted procedure to threshold and segment the SM to identify the phase. The thresholding is executed with the Bat Algorithm (BA) and Otsu's thresholding and the extraction is employed with the Watershed scheme. After extracting the SM slice, a relative study is applied to find the similarity level among the ground-truth and the SM to validate the performance. Further, the ABCD rule is also applied to identify the crucial SM parameters, such as Asymmetry (A), Border abnormality (B) and Diameter (D) to classify the considered SM images into Benign/Malignant. The outcome of this work confirms that, implemented practice works well on the chosen SM images.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCAN.2019.8878860","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8870340/8878677/08878860.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCAN.2019.8878860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ABCD Rule Implementation for the Skin Melanoma Assesment \u2013 A Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878860/","displayDocTitle":"ABCD Rule Implementation for the Skin Melanoma Assesment \u2013 A Study","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"19128748","htmlLink":"/document/8878860/","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ABCD Rule Implementation for the Skin Melanoma Assesment \u2013 A Study","confLoc":"Pondicherry, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCAN_2019_paper_274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099998S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8870340","isNumber":"8878677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8870340","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8878677","articleId":"8878860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8878864,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Effective resource allocation between secondary and primary users is the most significant key aspect in this environment. In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), resource allocation is used for total utilization of frequency spectrum. Limitations such as transmission power, interference threshold of primary users and traffic demands of secondary users builds the challenge for maximizing the energy-efficiency. In order to overcome the problem of maximum energy consumption and minimum energy efficiency, a Hybrid Water Filling (HWF) Algorithm is proposed. Combination of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Iterative Water Filling (IWF) algorithm is baptized as HWF. MOPSO is used to optimize the sub channels and energy allocation to achieve the highest capacity under the total energy constraint. Thus by combining IWF with MOPSO, the energy efficiency is augmented and provides optimal energy transmission for resource allocation. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm could achieve the optimal energy allocation than the existing one in less amount of time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878864/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19082817","publicationDate":"March 2019","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8878864/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Based on Hybrid Water Filling Algorithm for Energy Efficiency Enhancement in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation Based on Hybrid Water Filling Algorithm for Energy Efficiency Enhancement in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Pondicherry, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCAN_2019_paper_146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059495S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8870340","isNumber":"8878677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8870340","xplore-issue":"8878677","articleId":"8878864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8878867,"authors":[{"name":"Devasenathipathi N.

The intention of solving these problems is to find a better path (solution) among enormous, feasible, available solutions. The better (or best) solution should provide a cost effective path which would enable a anyone (or device) to travel to all the given cities (location) one and only once and finally return to the starting city(location). Approaches like Brute Force would not work since it is not feasible to calculate cost for all the possible paths (because rise in the number of cities would exponentially increase the number of all possible permutation of cities). Approaches like heuristics can be trusted reasonably as it uses reduced amount of computing power. Heuristic techniques are used because it gives quick and better solution even if it does not guarantee the best solution. In this research work, the authors propose a mutation operator called (m - mutation) that could be applied in genetic algorithm to solve permutation problems. The efficiency of the proposed mutation operator is compared with the efficiency of existing mutation operators in solving the same permutation problem and the results are encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCAN.2019.8878867","pdfPath":"/iel7/8870340/8878677/08878867.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on System,

associated design trade-offs. With an emphasis on beamforming to overcome mm-wave propagation challenges, a systematic link budget analysis has been carried out from 3GPP 5G NR standards to derive individual specifications for an RF front end module and RFIC. A detailed analysis of the effect of non-idealities on key figure of merits for receive and transmit chains is presented. Practical beamforming simulations is performed using a 2X4 dual polarized patch antenna array. It is also demonstrated that floorplan, power and thermal requirements play an important role in terms of decisions on technology-nodes, package-substrate selection and heterogenous integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878913/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"19082185","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8878913/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"System Budget to System Realization-A 5G mm-wave Beamformer Perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Budget to System Realization-A 5G mm-wave Beamformer Perspective","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076798S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8868012","isNumber":"8878909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8868012","xplore-issue":"8878909","articleId":"8878913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8878953,"authors":[{"name":"Yali Song","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yali","lastName":"Song","id":"37086402976"},{"name":"Yinghong Wen","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinghong","lastName":"Wen","id":"37594735200"},{"name":"Jinbao Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinbao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37601190500"},{"name":"Dan Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085359964"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0562-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0564-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8878953","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8878953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Mathematical model","Integrated circuit modeling","Biological neural networks","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","electromagnetic compatibility","electronic engineering computing","neural nets","railways"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NN model","BTM system","electromagnetic susceptibility","neural network modeling method","EMS data","NN algorithm","back-propagation NN modeling method","Balise transmission module system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","BTM system","electromagnetic susceptibility"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8878953","pdfPath":"/iel7/8868012/8878909/08878953.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","startPage":"0445","endPage":"0448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8878953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Prediction Model for the Susceptibility of Balise Transmission Module System Based on Neural Network","abstract":"In this paper, the Electromagnetic Susceptibility (EMS) of BTM system is predicted by Neural Network (NN) modeling method.

Furthermore, the stability condition for BuECs-G is proved and an edge spreading optimization method is proposed to design the structured GC-LDPC codes by predicting the iterative decoding thresholds of corresponding protographs.

The sensor head consists of an atomic vapor cell (filled with cesium atoms) embedded inside a waveguiding structure/antenna. Rydberg atom-based receivers/sensors are inherently different from conventional systems, as the vapor cell replaces the antenna and electronic components in the front-end of traditional RF systems and can operate over a frequency range from 500 MHz to 1 THz. For example, in a Rydberg atom system there is no need for traditional down-conversion electronics because the interaction between the optical probes, RF fields, and atoms automatically down-converts the carrier frequency to an intermediate frequency, which contains the signal of interest. We show several examples of phase and amplitude measurements of an RF field with this embedded Rydberg-atom sensor. We also demonstrate the discrimination of the polarization of an RF field and the ability to receive phase-modulated carrier communications signals with this integrated atomic sensor.

This embedded atomic sensor is also capable of receiving modulated communications signals. In this configuration, the PPWG antenna serves two functions. First, the PPWG antenna acts as a source for a local oscillator (LO) field. The LO is required to use an atomic vapor cell (a glass cell containing a Rydberg atom vapor) as a Rydberg atom-based mixer, which detects the amplitude and phase of a second RF field incident from some remote location. The second function of the PPWG antenna is to capture the RF field arriving from a remote location and concentrate it at the location of the atomic vapor cell for detection. To demonstrate this, we show several examples of phase and amplitude measurements of an RF field with the embedded Rydberg-atom sensor. We also demonstrate the discrimination of the polarization of an RF field and the ability to receive phase-modulated carrier communications signals with this integrated atomic sensor. Embedding the atomic sensor in an antenna allows for the full characterization of a radio frequency field, in that the magnitude, phase, and polarization of an RF field can be measured with one compact integrated quantum-based sensor. Furthermore, the embedded sensor head allows one to easily vary the LO in order to maximize the ability to measure phase and amplitude of the field or modulated signal.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949017","startPage":"164975","endPage":"164985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08878963.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedding a Rydberg Atom-Based Sensor Into an Antenna for Phase and Amplitude Detection of Radio-Frequency Fields and Modulated Signals","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/8600701/8878963-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Embedding a Rydberg Atom-Based Sensor Into an Antenna for Phase and Amplitude Detection of Radio-Frequency Fields and Modulated Signals","publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2019","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8878963/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"19144176","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8878963/","openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Embedding a Rydberg Atom-Based Sensor Into an Antenna for Phase and Amplitude Detection of Radio-Frequency Fields and Modulated Signals","sourcePdf":"access-holloway-2949017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095328S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8878963","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8878980,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Vasanelli","affiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Vasanelli","id":"38547504900"},{"name":"Benedikt Meinecke","affiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Benedikt","lastName":"Meinecke","id":"37086993464"},{"name":"Jonathan Mayer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Mayer","id":"37085779199"},{"name":"Omar Elsayad","affiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Elsayad","id":"37087058990"},{"name":"Philipp H\u00fcgler","affiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"H\u00fcgler","id":"37085767991"},{"name":"Fabian Roos","affiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Roos","id":"37085581967"},{"name":"Thomas Zwick","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zwick","id":"37085355507"},{"name":"Christian Waldschmidt","affiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Waldschmidt","id":"37281001700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0562-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0564-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8878980","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Radar antennas","MIMO radar","Antenna radiation patterns","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conformal antennas","direction-of-arrival estimation","millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mm-wave conformal antenna arrays","multiple-input multiple-output radars","radar sensor performance","optimization algorithm","antenna placement","nonplanar arrangement","experimental characterization","radar measurements","experimental 3\u00d78 MIMO radar sensor","direction of arrival estimation","beampatterns"]}],"abstract":"In a number of applications millimeter-wave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars are widely employed.

The design follows our previously reported analytical formalism [1]-[3], developed on the basis of [4], considering an array of four capacitively-loaded wires in one period \u039b = \u03bb/(sin\u03b8in-sin\u03b8out) [Fig. 1(a)], chosen such that only four Floquet-Bloch (FB) modes are propagating when the MG is excited from \u03b8in: two in transmission (direct ray and anomalous refraction) and two in reflection (specular and anomalous reflection) [3]. The formulation utilizes the degrees of freedom of the structure, namely, the four capacitor widths, and the respective horizontal and vertical offsets of the wires, to simultaneously enforce the design requirements: elimination of spurious FB modes using reactive loading [4], while minimizing induced currents (minimizing absorption) [1], [2]. As shall be presented, to yield fabrication-ready devices, we extend our previous derivation [2] to apply to multilayer PCB MGs, rigorously incorporating the dielectric substrate into the forward and backward scattering problem. This allows the entire design, up to the detailed PCB layout, to be completed without as much as a single run in a full-wave solver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Metagratings for Perfect Anomalous Refraction: Theory and Experiment","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8879145","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8868012/8878909/08879145.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8879145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Metagratings for Perfect Anomalous Refraction: Theory and Experiment","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879145/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19149457","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Metagratings for Perfect Anomalous Refraction: Theory and Experiment","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070996S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8868012","isNumber":"8878909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8868012","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8878909","articleId":"8879145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879175,"authors":[{"name":"Debdeep Sarkar","affiliation":["Royal Military College, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Debdeep","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37072099600"},{"name":"Yahia Antar","affiliation":["Royal Military College, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Yahia","lastName":"Antar","id":"37281053200"},{"name":"Said Mikki","affiliation":["University of New Haven, West Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Mikki","id":"37540727700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0562-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0564-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8879175","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Noise measurement","Time-domain analysis","MIMO communication","Antennas","Mutual coupling","Finite difference methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antennas","finite difference time-domain analysis","Green's function methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general antenna systems","thin-wire dipoles","far-field correlation coefficients","FDTD-IDM-CGF approach","mutual coupling","near-field correlation coefficients","temporal Poynting energy dynamics","FDTD-IDM-CGF method","unified computational scheme FDTD-IDM-CGF","finite-difference time-domain technique","infinitesimal dipole modelling","cross-correlation Greens functions","FDTD-IDM-CGF methodology","spatial correlation","spatio-temporal near-field energy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a unified computational scheme FDTD-IDM-CGF, which combines the well-known finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique with the infinitesimal dipole modelling (IDM) and cross-correlation Greens functions (CGF).

In the ES-FEM, the computational domain is first decomposed into a number of non-overlapping smoothing domains associated with each edge of tetrahedrons. Unlike the traditional FEM, the smoothed gradient technique is then applied to averaging the gradient of nodal basis functions in ES-FEM and leads to an averaged stiff matrix. Since adjacent geometry information is considered in the ES-FEM, it is much more stable to mesh distortions. A multiscale electrostatic lens is modeled to demonstrate the capabilities of the ES-FEM. Therefore, the ES-FEM shows great potential to solve practical complex multiscale problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8868012/8878909/08879207.pdf","startPage":"0780","endPage":"0782","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8879207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8879207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Edge-Based Smoothed FEM for Multiscale Electrostatic Lens Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","Smoothing methods","Electrostatics","Lenses","Solid modeling","Numerical models","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic lenses","finite element analysis","geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ES-FEM","traditional FEM","smoothed gradient technique","edge-based smoothed FEM","multiscale electrostatic lens modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiscale","edge-based","smoothed FEM","mesh distortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","displayDocTitle":"An Edge-Based Smoothed FEM for Multiscale Electrostatic Lens Modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879207/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19128661","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Edge-Based Smoothed FEM for Multiscale Electrostatic Lens Modeling","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085268S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8868012","isNumber":"8878909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8868012","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8878909","articleId":"8879207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879211,"authors":[{"name":"Hideki Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Muroran Institute of Technology, Muroran, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37270375400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0562-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0564-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8879211","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Integral equations","Harmonic analysis","Boundary conditions","Green's function methods","Current density"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absorbing boundary condition","FDTD method","surface equivalence theorem","spherical harmonics expression","finite-difference time-domain method","time-domain surface integral equation","incident angle","ABC location","perfectly matched layer","surface integral equation","harmonic Green's function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain method","absorbing boundary condition","perfectly matched layer","time-domain surface integral equation","surface equivalent theorem","electric and magnetic surface charge and current densities","spherical harmonics expression","multi-pole expansion"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers speed-up of a calculation of an absorbing boundary condition (ABC) of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method based on a time-domain surface integral equation.

The most popular class of surrogates, data-driven (or approximation) models suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which limits both the number of parameters and their ranges that can be effectively handled. A recently proposed nested kriging modeling framework allows us to work around these limitations by restricting the surrogate model domain to the vicinity of a set of reference designs pre-optimized with respect to the selected performance figures. This significantly improves the model reliability while reducing the number of training data samples necessary to set up the surrogate. In this paper, an improved design of experiments (sampling scheme) is proposed, which further reduces the modeling error as demonstrated using two high-frequency structures: a dual-band uniplanar dipole antenna, and a miniaturized impedance matching transformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8879213/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19082095","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Surrogate Modeling of High-Frequency Structures Using Nested Kriging and Improved Sampling Strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surrogate Modeling of High-Frequency Structures Using Nested Kriging and Improved Sampling Strategy","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059796S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8868012","isNumber":"8878909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8868012","xplore-issue":"8878909","articleId":"8879213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8879272,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa ELsaadouny","affiliation":["Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"ELsaadouny","id":"37087052590"},{"name":"Jan Barowski","affiliation":["Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Barowski","id":"37070204700"},{"name":"Jochen Jebramcik","affiliation":["Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Jebramcik","id":"37086153742"},{"name":"Ilona Rolfes","affiliation":["Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Ilona","lastName":"Rolfes","id":"37300150000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0562-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0564-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8879272","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Three-dimensional displays","Synthetic aperture radar","Microwave imaging","Microwave theory and techniques","Radar polarimetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image filtering","matched filters","microwave imaging","millimetre wave imaging","nondestructive testing","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","three-dimensional printing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave SAR imaging","nondestructive testing","NDT","3D printed samples","synthetic aperture radar imaging","microwave imaging","SAR measurements","image formation","SAR images","sample inner structure","3D-printed technology","positioning table","rectangular-scan mode","matched filter technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-printed technology","Microwave imaging","SAR processing","Matched filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879272","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8879272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2019.8879272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8878909","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8868012/8878909/08879272.pdf","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter Wave SAR Imaging for the Non-Destructive Testing of 3D-printed Samples","abstract":"This paper provides a method for the non-destructive testing (NDT) of 3D printed samples, based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging.

The tested sample has been placed on a positioning table which has been used to achieve a rectangular-scan mode for the SAR imaging. The gathered SAR measurements have been processed by the matched filter technique for image formation.

However, within the initial deployment of 5G, mm-waves are still relegated and there is a generalized idea that the mm-wave channel for radio access, in comparison to the sub-6 GHz channel, is not only sparse but also troublesome for outdoor applications. In the present paper we introduce simultaneous multi-band measurements comparing the sub-6 GHz with the mm-waves channel at 30 GHz and 60 GHz in street canyon scenarios using the same measurement equipment in Germany and Japan. An analysis on the propagation and radio channel characteristics shows that the mm-waves channel offers similar opportunities as the sub-6 GHz. Consequently, the challenge relies on the design of an adequate radio interface matching the channel characteristics. In that regard, aspects as the location of clusters and spatial consistency gain importance within geometry-based stochastic channel models (GBSCMs). The analysis of the large-scale parameters (LSPs) has shown a large influence of the geometry of the scenario on the channel, encouraging the introduction of deterministic modelling components within GBSCMs targeting these scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08879468.pdf","startPage":"160385","endPage":"160396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Band Propagation and Radio Channel Characterization in Street Canyon Scenarios for 5G and Beyond","topic":"Millimeter-wave and Terahertz Propagation, Channel Modeling and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Band Propagation and Radio Channel Characterization in Street Canyon Scenarios for 5G and Beyond","volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2019","accessionNumber":"19124522","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8879468/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879468/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD, Projektbezogener Personenaustausch mit Japan 2017)"},{"fundingName":"Article Processing Charge by the German Research Foundation (DFG)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007826","fundingName":"Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-Band Propagation and Radio Channel Characterization in Street Canyon Scenarios for 5G and Beyond","sourcePdf":"access-dupleich-2948869-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097404S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Millimeter-wave and Terahertz Propagation, Channel Modeling and Applications"],"articleId":"8879468","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879484,"authors":[{"name":"Lalit Chettri","affiliation":["5G IoT Lab, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Sikkim Manipal University, Majitar, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8955685/8879484/chett-2948888-small.gif","p":["Lalit Chettri received the Bachelor in Engineering degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Visveswaraya Technological University, Karnataka, India, in 2014, and the M.Tech. degree in digital electronics and communication engineering from Sikkim Manipal University, Majitar, India, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with a dissertation titled \u201cDesign of 5G wireless technology enabling machine type communication.\u201d","He has been involved in 5G research in 2016 and his research work on 5G has been published in different international journal and conference proceedings.

In the context of wireless technology, fifth-generation (5G) technology has become a most challenging and interesting topic in wireless research. This article provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G wireless systems. IoT in the 5G system will be a game changer in the future generation. It will open a door for new wireless architecture and smart services. Recent cellular network LTE (4G) will not be sufficient and efficient to meet the demands of multiple device connectivity and high data rate, more bandwidth, low-latency quality of service (QoS), and low interference. To address these challenges, we consider 5G as the most promising technology. We provide a detailed overview of challenges and vision of various communication industries in 5G IoT systems. The different layers in 5G IoT systems are discussed in detail. This article provides a comprehensive review on emerging and enabling technologies related to the 5G system that enables IoT. We consider the technology drivers for 5G wireless technology, such as 5G new radio (NR), multiple-input-multiple-output antenna with the beamformation technology, mm-wave commutation technology, heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the role of augmented reality (AR) in IoT, which are discussed in detail. We also provide a review on low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), security challenges, and its control measure in the 5G IoT scenario. This article introduces the role of AR in the 5G IoT scenario. This article also discusses the research gaps and future directions. The focus is also on application areas of IoT in 5G systems. We, therefore, outline some of the important research directions in 5G IoT.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948888","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/08879484.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948888","startPage":"16","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8955685/08879484.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8955685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Survey on Internet of Things (IoT) Toward 5G Wireless Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Survey on Internet of Things (IoT) Toward 5G Wireless Systems","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19260601","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879484/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comprehensive Survey on Internet of Things (IoT) Toward 5G Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-chettri-2948888-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.223858S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8955685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"8955685","articleId":"8879484","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879493,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Yang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-5497-524X","id":"37533846800"},{"name":"Jin Cao","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Cao","orcid":"0000-0002-2474-3795","id":"37088513142"},{"name":"Zerong Shang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zerong","lastName":"Shang","id":"37086616107"},{"name":"Yaping Cai","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yaping","lastName":"Cai","orcid":"0000-0002-8608-3454","id":"37085441902"},{"name":"Jianping Xu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-8453-8777","id":"37279198600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8879493","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":451},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Buck converters","Frequency conversion","Sensitivity","Impedance","Frequency control","Equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","dynamic response","electric impedance","frequency control","power factor correction","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic response","constant on-time control","COT-controlled buck converter","phase shifted voltage","double-line frequency output voltage ripple","power factor correction converter","quasisingle stage AC-DC converter","double-line frequency ripple suppression","DLF ripple suppressor","closed-loop audio sensitivity","output impedance","DLF output voltage ripple","PFC converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power factor correction (PFC)","DLF output voltage ripple","constant on-time (COT) control","dynamic response","stability analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879493","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/9204872/08879493.pdf","startPage":"2074","endPage":"2078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2019.2948942","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2019.2948942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9204872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-Line Frequency Ripple Suppression of a Quasi-Single Stage AC\u2013DC Converter","abstract":"Owing to the instantaneous difference between variable AC input power and the constant DC output power, power factor correction (PFC) converter suffers from serious double-line frequency (DLF) output voltage ripple.

Prior anti-jamming work mainly discussed fixed transmission time and considered saturated scenarios in which the agent always had packets to transmit. But HF dynamic spectrum environment and time-varying communication demand make traditional anti-jamming methods ineffective. To cope with above challenge, dynamic transmission time and packet scheduling are considered in this manuscript. The transmitter selects the working channel and the number of packets to be transmitted according to current jamming environment and buffer state. Simultaneously, channel diversity which allows the transmitter to select multiple channels to send same packet is also considered to overcome the unreliable and unstable characteristics of HF channel. We formulate the decision making process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose an interference-aware reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm combining Q learning with upper confidence bounds for trees (UCT) balances exploration and exploitation of action set. Simulation results show that higher network throughput and less packet loss are obtained by the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08879499.pdf","startPage":"157072","endPage":"157084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Selection and Data Scheduling in HF Jamming Environment: An Interference-Aware Reinforcement Learning Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Selection and Data Scheduling in HF Jamming Environment: An Interference-Aware Reinforcement Learning Approach","volume":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879499/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19124394","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879499/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20160034"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61961010"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Key Laboratory Fund of Embedded Technology and Intelligent System","grantNumber":"2018B-1"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory Found of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing, Ministry of Education (Guilin University of Electronic Technology)","grantNumber":"CRKL180203"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Channel Selection and Data Scheduling in HF Jamming Environment: An Interference-Aware Reinforcement Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2948935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15442S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8879499","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879505,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hassanin","affiliation":["University of Delaware, Newark, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8960485/8879505/hassa-2948908-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Hassanin received the B.Sc. degree (magna cum laude) in electronics engineering from The American University in Cairo, Egypt, in 2011, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Delaware in 2015 and 2018, respectively.

We will first study a simplified version assuming no ISI, developing a scheme to adapt space filling curves to this environment, and studying the theoretical limits. Then, we will extend the analysis to the end-to-end acoustic channel (including ISI), discussing the proposed system in this case. Finally, we will present simulation results of the proposed communication system for the simplified (no ISI) and end-to-end channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"68","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19266612","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879505/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analog Mappings for Non-Linear Channels With Applications to Underwater Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CIF-0915800 and CCF-1618653"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Mappings for Non-Linear Channels With Applications to Underwater Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hassanin-2948908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12814S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8960485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8960485","articleId":"8879505","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879506,"authors":[{"name":"Akihiko Kanda","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiko","lastName":"Kanda","orcid":"0000-0003-2699-531X","id":"37864265100"},{"name":"Takashi Kurafuji","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Kurafuji","id":"37086635590"},{"name":"Koichi Takeda","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37953722100"},{"name":"Tomoya Ogawa","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"38580633500"},{"name":"Yasuhiko Taito","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiko","lastName":"Taito","id":"37727977400"},{"name":"Kazuo Yoshihara","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Yoshihara","id":"37086920930"},{"name":"Masaya Nakano","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaya","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37085504734"},{"name":"Takashi Ito","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Ito","id":"38581033900"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Kondo","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37320984200"},{"name":"Takashi Kono","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Kono","id":"38580526400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-9603"}],"articleNumber":"8879506","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879506","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded systems","Memory management","Dielectric breakdown","Noise measurement","Flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SG-MONOS","split-gate MONOS","factory program","high-speed program mode","low-noise program mode","peak current consumption","high-k metal gate CMOS process technology","embedded Hash system","automotive applications","over-the-air software update","read operations","embedded flash system","software switching","eFlash system","program throughput","byte rate 46.0 GByte/s","time 1.0 ms","temperature -40.0 degC to 170.0 degC","size 28 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded flash (eFlash) memory","high-speed read","low-noise program","over-the-air software update (OTA)","split-gate MONOS (SG-MONOS)","time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB)"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents an embedded Hash (eFlash) system based on 28-nm split-gate MONOS (SG-MONOS) with high-k metal gate CMOS process technology for automotive applications.

Owing to the discrete-phase constraints, this problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINP) and is generally NP-hard. To handle it, an alternating optimization approach is employed. Specifically, for the digital beamformer, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming is utilized. For the discrete-phase analog beamformer, we first derive an equivalent continuous reformulation and then solve it by leveraging an inexact majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, which is built upon the first-order method and MM update.

Dependability is one of the main aspects that need to be investigated and tackled in order to profitably use NFV in the future. The main objective of this paper is to propose a comprehensive approach to estimate the end-to-end NFV-deployed service availability and present a quantitative assessment of the network factors that affect the availability of the service provided by an NFV architecture. To achieve this goal, we adopted a two-level availability model where i) the low level considers the network topology structure and NFV connectivity requirements through the definition of the system structure function based on minimal-cut sets and ii) the higher level examines dynamics and failure modes of network and NFV elements through stochastic activity networks. By using the proposed model, we have carried out an extensive sensitivity analysis to identify the impact on the service availability of the different service elements involved in the delivery, and their deployment across the network. The results highlight the significant impact that network nodes have on the end-to-end network service. Less robust network nodes may reduce the availability of an NFV-enabled service by more than one order of magnitude even though NFV elements like VNFs or MANO are provided with redundancy. Moreover, the results show that adopting an SDN-integrated network degrades the service availability and increases the vulnerability of the network service to SDN controllers unless adequately protected.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/8930332/08879511.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2019.2948725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2019.2948725","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Aware Availability Modeling of an End-to-End NFV-Enabled Service","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879511/","displayDocTitle":"Network-Aware Availability Modeling of an End-to-End NFV-Enabled Service","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879511/","volume":"16","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"19334797","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Marie Curie Actions project","grantNumber":"607584 (the CleanSky project)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Aware Availability Modeling of an End-to-End NFV-Enabled Service","sourcePdf":"tnsm-tola-2948725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072765S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8930332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8930332","articleId":"8879511","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8879512,"authors":[{"name":"Lingxuan Shao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/9204502/8879512/shao-2948907-small.gif","p":["Lingxuan Shao received the B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2018.

However, the existing design automation techniques have not thoroughly considered the reliability model to reduce the induced concentration errors during sample preparation. This article proposes a fast reliability-aware sample preparation (RASP) method for determining the optimized sequence of mixing steps (mixing process) with the enhanced reliability. In RASP, a probabilistic concentration prediction model is proposed for analyzing the reliability of a given mixing process. Based on this probabilistic model, a lookup table construction algorithm along with the table query method is proposed to obtain the optimized mixing process. The simulation results show that for any user-specified target concentration, RASP can effectively determine the optimized mixing process, which generates the droplets with target concentration within the error tolerance of 0.1%. Compared with the state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithm, RASP improves the reliability-related accuracy by 91.4% on average via 2048 testcases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/9204502/08879512.pdf","startPage":"2708","endPage":"2721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2019.2948907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2019.2948907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9204502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lookup Table-Based Fast Reliability-Aware Sample Preparation Using Digital Microfluidic Biochips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biochips","Reliability","Biological system modeling","Probabilistic logic","Nonhomogeneous media","Predictive models","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","drops","electronic design automation","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","mixing","query processing","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["table query method","optimized mixing process","user-specified target concentration","RASP","state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithm","reliability-related accuracy","lookup table-based fast reliability-aware sample preparation","digital microfluidic biochips","prepared fluidic samples","automated sample preparation","induced errors","resultant concentration values","automation techniques","reliability model","induced concentration errors","probabilistic concentration prediction model","probabilistic model","lookup table construction algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips","lookup table","reliability","sample preparation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Lookup Table-Based Fast Reliability-Aware Sample Preparation Using Digital Microfluidic Biochips","volume":"39","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8879512/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2020","accessionNumber":"19984818","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2221- E-007-118-MY3 and 104-2220-E-007-021"},{"fundingName":"Technical University of Munich-Institute for Advanced Study through the German Excellence Initiative and the European Union Seventh Framework Program","grantNumber":"291763"},{"fundingName":"SERB, Government of India through the Early Career Research Award","grantNumber":"ECR/2016/001921"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61674093 and 61974084"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lookup Table-Based Fast Reliability-Aware Sample Preparation Using Digital Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tcad-yao-2948907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13058S","chronDate":"Oct.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"9204502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9204502","articleId":"8879512","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879514,"authors":[{"name":"Qingsong Xie","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8879514/xie-2948857-small.gif","p":["Qingsong Xie received the B.S. degree in electronic information engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2015.

The recent advancement in deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has renewed the interest in applying deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of heartbeat classification. So far, the results are not very exciting. Most of the existing methods are based on ECG morphological information, which makes deep learning difficult to extract discriminative features for classification. Towards an opposite direction of feature extraction or selection, this paper proceeds along a recent proposed direction named feature enrichment (FE). To exploit the advantage of deep learning, we develop a FE-CNN classifier by enriching the ECG signals into time-frequency images by discrete short-time Fourier transform and then using the images as the input to CNN. Experiments on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database show FE-CNN obtains sensitivity (Sen) of 75.6%, positive predictive rate (Ppr) of 90.1%, and F1 score of 0.82 for the detection of supraventricular ectopic (S) beats. Sen, Ppr, and F1 score are 92.8%, 94.5%, and 0.94, respectively, for ventricular ectopic (V) beat detection. The result demonstrates our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms including other CNN based methods, without any hand-crafted features, especially F1 score for S beat detection from 0.75 to 0.82. This FE-CNN classifier is simple, effective, and easy to be applied to other types of vital signs.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948857","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08879514.pdf","startPage":"153751","endPage":"153760","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Enrichment Based Convolutional Neural Network for Heartbeat Classification From Electrocardiogram","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Feature Enrichment Based Convolutional Neural Network for Heartbeat Classification From Electrocardiogram","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"19087582","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8879514/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China","grantNumber":"2018AAA0100700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004921","fundingName":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","grantNumber":"WF220103010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61874171"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Feature Enrichment Based Convolutional Neural Network for Heartbeat Classification From Electrocardiogram","sourcePdf":"access-xie-2948857-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12227S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8879514","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8879517,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/9040688/8879517/li-2948643-small.gif","p":["Hao Li was born in Shanxi, China, in 1991.

Most previous works on Massive MIMO systems have focused on the power optimization to maximize the system energy efficiency, in which the ergodic achievable sum-rate is replaced with a lower bound closed-form expression, which can result in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to optimize the power assignment to achieve the maximum energy efficiency for a downlink system of single-cell Massive MIMO based on a tight approximate expression for the achievable sum-rate. Considering two linear precoding strategies at base station, i.e., maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing, we first derive the corresponding approximate closed-form of the achievable sum-rate under imperfect channel state information. Furthermore, an energy-efficient power allocation scheme is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. An iterative power allocation algorithm that maximizes the system energy efficiency is developed based on the Lagrangian dual approach. Simulation results demonstrate the tightness of the proposed approximate closed-form expressions, and show that our designed algorithm yields much better energy efficiency performance over the existing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for an Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO System With Imperfect CSI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2019.2948643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/9040688/08879517.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2019.2948643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9040688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for an Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO System With Imperfect CSI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8879517/","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2020","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19469995","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation for an Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO System With Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tgcn-li-2948643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126508S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"9040688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","xplore-issue":"9040688","articleId":"8879517","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879518,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Lu","affiliation":["University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8879518/lu-2948976-small.gif","p":["Wenjie Lu received the B.S. degree in mechatronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

This reduced space is found by a sparse search tree, which is enabled by a Metric Function (MF) built on a neural network. The offline-learnt MF estimates the minimum traveling cost between any two nodes in a fixed small workspace with various obstacles. It allows connections of two sparse nodes without path planning, where the connections represent the traveling costs (not paths). It is proven that the asymptotic optimality is preserved in the RSBP (assuming a zero-error MF) and the optimality degeneration is bounded (assuming a bounded-error MF). The computational complexity during planning is shown linear to the Lebesgue measure of the entire search space (assuming the same sampling density across environments). Numerical simulations have shown that in tested large and cluttered environments the RSBP is at least as fast as the bidirectional fast marching tree* and informed rapidly exploring random tree*, with planned paths of similar optimality. The results also have shown the RSBP's improved scalability to large environments and enhanced efficiency in dealing with narrow passages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8879518/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087590","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Sampling-Based Optimal Path Planning Approach via Search Space Reduction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"LP150100935"},{"fundingName":"Roads and Maritime Services of NSW"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001775","fundingName":"University of Technology Sydney"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Scalable Sampling-Based Optimal Path Planning Approach via Search Space Reduction","sourcePdf":"access-lu-2948976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097793S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8879518","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8879542,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Our closed-form solution for 3D intensity distribution for a finite-size LED is consistent with Lambert's Cosine Law, which provides the 3D intensity distribution for an infinitesimal, flat light source. We also derive the formula for the 2D intensity distribution on a diode surface showing its similarity to a Gaussian function, which is typically used to approximate the surface light intensity profile for an LED and a laser diode. Our 2D intensity distribution function produces light propagation similar to the Gaussian beam propagation in space. However, unlike the Gaussian approximation, our formula invariably produces this behavior without assuming the refractive index inside the diode follows a quadratic function of the transverse spatial domains. Our 2D and 3D spatial intensity formulas in near-field for LEDs offer a unique way to calculate the peak intensity that occurs at the center of the flat LED source. We demonstrate, as expected, that the peak intensity increases with the size of the LED source as well as the brightness of each radiative electron-hole pair, which is a function of the drive current and quantum efficiency of the LED.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","externalId":"8201219","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879542/","impactStatement":"We present closed-form analytic formulas for near-field 3D & 2D light distributions for a finite LED.

As nodes across distributed networks must co-exist, it is important that all transmitters and receivers are aware of their radio frequency (RF) surroundings so that they can adapt their transmission and reception parameters to best suit their needs. To this end, machine learning techniques have become popular as they can learn, analyze and predict the RF signals and associated parameters that characterize the RF environment. However, in the presence of adversaries, malicious activities such as jamming and spoofing are inevitable, making most machine learning techniques ineffective in such environments. In this paper we propose the Radio Frequency Adversarial Learning (RFAL) framework for building a robust system to identify rogue RF transmitters by designing and implementing a generative adversarial net (GAN). We hope to exploit transmitter specific \u201csignatures\u201d like the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance (i.e., the I/Q imbalance) present in all transmitters for this task, by learning feature representations using a deep neural network that uses the I/Q data from received signals as input. After detection and elimination of the adversarial transmitters RFAL further uses this learned feature embedding as \u201cfingerprints\u201d for categorizing the trusted transmitters. More specifically, we implement a generative model that learns the sample space of the I/Q values of known transmitters and uses the learned representation to generate signals that imitate the transmissions of these transmitters. We program 8 universal software radio peripheral (USRP) software defined radios (SDRs) as trusted transmitters and collect \u201cover-the-air\u201d raw I/Q data from them using a Realtek Software Defined Radio (RTL-SDR), in a laboratory setting. We also implement a discriminator model that discriminates between the trusted transmitters and the counterfeit ones with 99.9% accuracy and is trained in the GAN framework using data from the generator. Finally, after elimination of the adversarial transmitters, the trusted transmitters are classified using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to demonstrate building of an end-to-end robust transmitter identification system with RFAL. Experimental results reveal that the CNN, DNN, and RNN are able to correctly distinguish between the 8 trusted transmitters with 81.6%, 94.6% and 97% accuracy respectively. We also show that better \u201ctrusted transmission\u201d classification accuracy is achieved for all three types of neural networks when data from two different types of transmitters (different manufacturers) are used rather than when using the same type of transmitter (same manufacturer).","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2019.2948919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9112755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2019.2948919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/9112755/08879545.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RFAL: Adversarial Learning for RF Transmitter Identification and Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"RFAL: Adversarial Learning for RF Transmitter Identification and Classification","volume":"6","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879545/","publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19673096","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879545/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Munitions Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin AFB, FL, USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RFAL: Adversarial Learning for RF Transmitter Identification and Classification","sourcePdf":"tccn-roy-2948919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110229S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"9112755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"9112755","articleId":"8879545","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879551,"authors":[{"name":"William J.

This is accomplished through a combination of passive measurements using a vector network analyzer (VNA) and active measurements on a fully functioning integrated voltage regulator system.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2019.2948825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/9014414/08879551.pdf","startPage":"6208","endPage":"6220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2019.2948825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9014414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Thin-Film Magnetic Inductors Applied to Integrated Voltage Regulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879551/","displayDocTitle":"Study of Thin-Film Magnetic Inductors Applied to Integrated Voltage Regulators","volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19409023","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879551/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Thin-Film Magnetic Inductors Applied to Integrated Voltage Regulators","sourcePdf":"tpel-lambert-2948825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092904S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"9014414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9014414","articleId":"8879551","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8879552,"authors":[{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0001-7566-626X","id":"37087095453"},{"name":"Weisheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-0430-1201","id":"37279192600"},{"name":"Xiaojing Wu","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37087748229"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2267"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2275"}],"articleNumber":"8879552","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879552","abstract":"In this article, complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with proportional delays and inhibitory factors are proposed. First, the global exponential stability of the model addressed is investigated by employing the Halanay inequality technique and the matrix measure method. Some criteria are derived to guarantee the global exponential stability of CVNNs with proportional delays and inhibitory factors. The obtained criteria are applicable not only to systems with proportional delays but also to systems with arbitrary delays. Here, the Lyapunov functions are not constructed. Compared with the Lyapunov method, the matrix measure method makes the obtained criteria more concise, and the Halanay inequality makes the analytical procedure more compact. Furthermore, the global exponential synchronization of two neural-network models with proportional delays and inhibitory factors is also studied. By designing a feedback controller and giving some limitation conditions, the drive system and the response system realize global exponential synchronization. Finally, numerical simulation examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2019.2946076","startPage":"2142","endPage":"2152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with high order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The proposed construction is structurally similar to a Raptor code consisting of an inner Luby transform (LT)-style code and an outer low density parity check (LDPC) code. The main novelty is that the output degree distribution for the LT part is time-varying and the degree of the parity bits decreases with time, parity bits with the same degree are clustered together rather than random, which is totally different from traditional fixed degree distributions. Simulation results with a joint iterative decoding algorithm demonstrate that both the goodput and the bit error rate (BER) performance of our proposed scheme are better than those of newly reported Raptor codes for the AWGN channel in most cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"24","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19262390","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879556/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Raptor Codes With Descending Order Degrees for AWGN Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CCF","grantNumber":"1619085"},{"fundingName":"JSPS through the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C)","grantNumber":"18K04132"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009105","fundingName":"Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications","grantNumber":"195007002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571329 and 61831018"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Key Research and Development Program Major Science and Technology Projects","grantNumber":"2018B010115002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Raptor Codes With Descending Order Degrees for AWGN Channels","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wu-2948906-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067551S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8952820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8952820","articleId":"8879556","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879563,"authors":[{"name":"Chunfeng Liu","affiliation":["Chair of Electronic Design Automation, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/9204502/8879563/liu-2948904-small.gif","p":["Chunfeng Liu received the bachelor\u2019s degree in automation and the master\u2019s degree in microelectronics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

As the integration of such chips is increasing, a flexible general reconfigurable platform, fully programmable valve array (FPVA), has emerged. Such a 2-D array comprises regularly arranged valves using which flow-networks with different geometry, size, and connectivity can be constructed dynamically. However, the test generation for such arrays becomes challenging due to the large number of potential flow-networks and transportation paths that can be configured on-chip. In this article, we propose a strategy to generate efficient test patterns for FPVAs based on the concepts of test paths and cuts. These patterns together can cover multiple faults in both flow and control layers. We also introduce the concept of test trees and multiple cuts for a test pattern to deal with faults in FPVAs with multiple ports. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to generate test patterns for traditional flow-based biochips with predefined architectures. The simulation results demonstrate that defects in FPVAs can be detected reliably by a limited number of test patterns generated by the proposed method. For traditional biochips with predefined architectures, these patterns also exhibit an improved test efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2019.2948904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/9204502/08879563.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2019.2948904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9204502","startPage":"2530","endPage":"2543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test Generation for Flow-Based Microfluidic Biochips With General Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Test Generation for Flow-Based Microfluidic Biochips With General Architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2020","accessionNumber":"19984804","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879563/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through TUM International Graduate School of Science and Engineering"},{"fundingName":"INAE Chair Professorship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013357","fundingName":"Nanotechnology Research Triangle through the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011102","fundingName":"Technical University of Munich\u2014Institute for Advanced Study through the German Excellence Initiative and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"291763"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Generation for Flow-Based Microfluidic Biochips With General Architectures","sourcePdf":"tcad-li-2948904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143704S","chronDate":"Oct.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"9204502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","xplore-issue":"9204502","articleId":"8879563","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879568,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantina N.

The proposed methodology requires the input segmented silhouettes from the three simultaneously acquired frames, and it is capable of detecting fall events in every location of the imaged environment. The presented algorithm uses the model of fisheye image formation that is based on the spherical projection followed by central projection. Under this model, vertical structures are imaged as straight lines passing through the center of field of view, by a camera with approximately vertical optical axis. The main advantages of this article are the simplicity of the detecting rule, the speed of execution, and the utilization of heterogeneous omnidirectional cameras that allows simultaneous imaging along any direction.

However, in CS, the number of measurements needed to reconstruct the sparse signal is determined by the actual sparsity order of the signal, which, in practice, is often unknown and dynamically varying. Thus, in practice, an excessive number of measurements has to be chosen, and choosing such a number degrades the sensing performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a two-step adaptive compressive spectrum sensing (TS-ACSS) method to estimate the sparsity order. By using a simple statistical analysis of the compressive measurements, a coarse estimation of the sparsity order can be obtained, and an accurate estimation can be acquired by comparing multiple iterations. Compared with existing CS approaches, the proposed TS-ACSS method can not only adaptively adopt an optimal number of measurements without a priori knowledge about current sparsity order but can also detect a sensing failure that can happen if the wideband signal is not sparse in the frequency domain and if the noise level is too large to sense successfully. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of our method in dynamic spectrum changing scenarios. The results show that our method can work in both low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and high SNRs environments, and can also be applied in the condition of different energy coefficients and positions of channel occupancy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","volume":"68","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"19404541","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8879571/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Compressive Spectrum Sensing Based on Sparsity Order Estimation in Wideband Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Compressive Spectrum Sensing Based on Sparsity Order Estimation in Wideband Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"tvt-luo-2948966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092644S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8935346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"8935346","articleId":"8879571","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8879573,"authors":[{"name":"Guanhua Qiao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8955685/8879573/qiao-2945640-small.gif","p":["Guanhua Qiao is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.","His current research interests include mobile edge computation and caching in wireless heterogeneous network, resource management, and network optimization."]},"firstName":"Guanhua","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085775483"},{"name":"Supeng Leng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8955685/8879573/leng-2945640-small.gif","p":["Supeng Leng received the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.","He is a Full Professor and a Vice Dean with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

We formulate the joint optimization problem as a double time-scale Markov decision process (DTS-MDP), based on the fact that the time-scale of content timeliness changes less frequently as compared to the vehicle mobility and network states during the content delivery process. At the beginning of the large time-scale, the content placement/updating decision can be obtained according to the content popularity, vehicle driving paths, and resource availability. On the small time-scale, the joint vehicle scheduling and bandwidth allocation scheme is designed to minimize the content access cost while satisfying the constraint on content delivery latency. To solve the long-term mixed integer linear programming (LT-MILP) problem, we propose a nature-inspired method based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework to obtain a suboptimal solution with a low computation complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative caching system can reduce the system cost, as well as the content delivery latency, and improve content hit ratio, as compared to the noncooperative and random edge caching schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"7","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19260633","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879573/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Content Caching in Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFC0807101"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Sichuan Province, China","grantNumber":"2019YFH0007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016Z011"},{"fundingName":"EU H2020 Project COSAFE","grantNumber":"MSCA-RISE-2018-824019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Content Caching in Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-leng-2945640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121616S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8955685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8955685","articleId":"8879573","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879578,"authors":[{"name":"Fran Casino","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Pireas, Greece"],"firstName":"Fran","lastName":"Casino","orcid":"0000-0003-4296-2876","id":"37085633049"},{"name":"Constantinos Patsakis","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Pireas, Greece"],"firstName":"Constantinos","lastName":"Patsakis","orcid":"0000-0002-4460-9331","id":"37298828800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9391"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0040"}],"articleNumber":"8879578","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Technology Management Council","url":"http://www.ieee.org/tmc"}],"abstract":"Information overload is a phenomenon of our days due to the unprecedented penetration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in our daily lives. As a result, people often end up with more options than they can process to choose from and therefore may opt for choices which do not fit best to their preferences. To address these issues, recommender systems (RSs) were proposed and have gained a lot of interest from the research community and industry. However, privacy is a big concern in these systems. While decentralized recommenders can protect privacy, they lack the needed efficiency to be widely adopted. In this article, we use blockchain as the backbone of a decentralized RS, managing to equip it with a broad set of features while simultaneously, preserving user's privacy. We introduce a new architecture, based on decentralized locality sensitive hashing classification as well as a set of recommendation methods, according to how data are managed by users. Extensive experimental results illustrate the performance and efficacy of our approach compared with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a discussion about its benefits and opportunities provides ground for further research.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blockchain","Privacy","Computer architecture","Data privacy","Security","Collaboration","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative filtering","data privacy","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information overload","unprecedented penetration","communication technologies","recommender systems","research community","decentralized recommenders","decentralized RS","decentralized locality sensitive hashing classification","recommendation methods","blockchain-based privacy-preserving collaborative filtering architecture","information and communication technologies","ICT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","collaborative filtering (CF) decentralized file storage","privacy","recommender systems (RSs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879578","doi":"10.1109/TEM.2019.2944279","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/17/9226631/08879578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2019.2944279","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9226631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Filtering Architecture","topic":"Blockchain Ecosystem: Technological and Management Challenges and Opportunities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Filtering Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879578/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8879578/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2020","publicationDate":"Nov. 2020","accessionNumber":"20056590","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020)"},{"fundingName":"CyberSec4Europe","grantNumber":"830929"},{"fundingName":"LOCARD","grantNumber":"832735"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Filtering Architecture","sourcePdf":"tem-patsakis-2944279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177305S","chronDate":"Nov.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"17","isNumber":"9226631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9226631","topics":["Blockchain Ecosystem: Technological and Management Challenges and Opportunities"],"articleId":"8879578","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879579,"authors":[{"name":"Hangjun Zhou","affiliation":["Hunan University of Finance and Economics, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8879579/hzhou-2948949-small.gif","p":["Hangjun Zhou received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the National University of Defense Technology.

Financial credit risk is by far one of the most significant risks that commercial banks have to face, however, when confronting to the massively growing financial data from multiple sources including Internet, mobile networks or IoT, traditional statistical models and neural network models might not operate fairly or accurately enough for credit risk assessment with those diverse data. Hence, there is a practical need to establish more powerful risk prediction models with artificial intelligence based on big data analytics to predict default behaviors with better accuracy and capacity. In this article, a big data mining approach of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Backpropagation (BP) neural network is proposed for financial risk management in commercial banks with IoT deployment, which constructs a nonlinear parallel optimization model with Apache Spark and Hadoop HDFS techniques on the dataset of on-balance sheet item and off-balance sheet item. The experiment results indicate that this parallel risk management model has fast convergence rate and powerful predictive capacity, and performs efficiently in screening default behaviors. In the meanwhile, the distributed implementation on big data clusters largely reduces the processing time of model training and testing.","topic":"Data Mining for Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"19087539","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8879579/","publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Big Data Mining Approach of PSO-Based BP Neural Network for Financial Risk Management With IoT","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hunan Provincial Education Science 13th Five-Year Plan","grantNumber":"XJK016BXX001"},{"fundingName":"Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province","grantNumber":"17YBA049"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","grantNumber":"2017JJ2016"},{"fundingName":"Open foundation for University Innovation Platform from Hunan Province, China"},{"fundingName":"2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Big Data for Financial and Economical Asset Development and Utility in Universities of Hunan Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Big Data Mining Approach of PSO-Based BP Neural Network for Financial Risk Management With IoT","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2948949-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09917S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Data Mining for Internet of Things"],"articleId":"8879579","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8879588,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaxing Wei","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/9378756/8879588/wei-2948836-small.gif","p":["Jiaxing Wei received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2019.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University.

The dominant degradation mechanism is demonstrated to be the injection of negative charges into the gate oxide interface along the channel. It results in the increase in threshold voltage ( V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n) and the increase in ON-state resistance ( R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dson</sub>\n) under low gate bias condition. Furthermore, the influences of different stages during an entire switching process on the degradation trend of the device are verified. It is found that the charges are mainly injected into the gate oxide during the conduction stage. Even though the turn-on stage rarely results in the injection directly, it increases the junction temperature ( T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n), contributing to the injection of charges during the conduction stage. However, the turn-off stage barely degrades the performance of the device. The research also proves the robustness of SiC power MOSFETs under repetitive out-of-safe operating area (SOA) switching conditions. Moreover, the degradation of switching behaviors of the device is analyzed. The increased V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n increases the Miller plateau voltage ( V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gp</sub>\n), leading to the increase in turn-on time and the decrease in turn-off time.

Simultaneously, dramatic improvements in machine learning and deep neural network architectures have enabled unprecedented analytical capabilities, which we see in increasingly common applications and production technologies, such as self-driving vehicles and intelligent mobile applications. Predictably, these technologies have seen rapid adoption, which has left many implementations vulnerable to threats unforeseen or undefended against. Moreover, such technologies can be used by malicious actors, and the potential for cyber threats, attacks, intrusions, and obfuscation that are only just being considered, applied, and countered. In this paper, we consider the good, the bad, and the ugly use of machine learning for cybersecurity and CPS/IoT. In detail, we consider the numerous benefits (good use) that machine learning has brought, both in general, and specifically for security and CPS/IoT, such as the improvement of intrusion detection mechanisms and decision accuracy in CPS/IoT. More pressing, we consider the vulnerabilities of machine learning (bad use) from the perspectives of security and CPS/IoT, including the ways in which machine learning systems can be compromised, misled, and subverted at all stages of the machine learning life-cycle (data collection, pre-processing, training, validation, implementation, etc.).

Emotion recognition is considered a highly valuable aspect of EC. Numerous studies have examined emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, but the recognition rate is unreliable. In this paper, a feature extraction method is proposed that is based on double tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) and machine learning. The emotions of 16 subjects are induced under video stimulation, and the original signal is acquired using a Neuroscan device. Both EEG and electromyography (EMG) signal are then eliminated by band-pass filtering, and the reconstructed signal of each frequency band is obtained by DTCWT. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is utilized to classify three kinds of emotions: calm, happy, and sad, obtaining a classification accuracy of 90.61%. Results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the feature vector and improve the problem of low accuracy in multiple class recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08879592.pdf","startPage":"154114","endPage":"154120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion Recognition Based on Double Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Machine Learning in Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879592","topic":"Green Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879592/","displayDocTitle":"Emotion Recognition Based on Double Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Machine Learning in Internet of Things","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19087569","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879592/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFA0209101"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61205057 and 11574136"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Emotion Recognition Based on Double Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Machine Learning in Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"access-yang-2948884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100863S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Green Internet of Things"],"articleId":"8879592","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879601,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxi Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8952842/8879601/wu-2946277-small.gif","p":["Jianxi Wu received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2016, and the M.S degree from the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2019.

The FMCW chirp is provided by a mixedmode phase-locked loop (PLL). A dual rising-edge fractionalphase detector based on time-to-digital converter (TDC) is proposed to overcome the problem caused by the rising and falling time mismatch. A 2.3 ns detection range, 10 ps resolution Vernier TDC is employed in the detector to cover the two consecutive rising edges with less power consumption. A self-calibrated delay chain is employed in the Vernier TDC to overcome process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. Furthermore, sampling-edge selection technique is utilized to avoid the glitch during phase detection. A divider-less frequency error estimator is presented to save area and power. By employing a coarsefine segmented digital-to-analog converter (DAC), the generator supports triangular and sawtooth-like FMCW chirp with reconfigurable period and bandwidth. An LC voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO) with split varactor is proposed to improve the linear tuning range. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the FMCW generator consumes 99 mW power and 0.7 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm chip area. The measurement results show that the phase noise from 78.7 GHz carrier is -87.4-dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The measured rootmean-square (RMS) frequency error of a sawtooth-like FMCW chirp with 4 GHz bandwidth and 0.1 ms period is 205 kHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879601/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"67","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19265593","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879601/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 77-GHz Mixed-Mode FMCW Generator Based on a Vernier TDC With Dual Rising-Edge Fractional-Phase Detector","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"Z191100007519005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 77-GHz Mixed-Mode FMCW Generator Based on a Vernier TDC With Dual Rising-Edge Fractional-Phase Detector","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chi-2946277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085213S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8952842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8952842","articleId":"8879601","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879603,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8952842/8879603/yang-2943569-small.gif","p":["Ming Yang (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in aerodynamic engineering from the Department of Aeronautics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2012, and the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

A hierarchical approach is adopted to analyze the propagation of PAM-symbol and FEC-symbol errors through a two-layer Markov model. A series of techniques including state aggregation, time aggregation, state reduction, and dynamic programming are introduced making the time complexity to compute post-FEC BER below 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-15</sup>\n reasonable. Error bounds associated with each method are found. The efficiency of the proposed model allows it to handle a larger state space, more DFE taps, and more sophisticated linear block codes than prior work. A 4-PAM 60 Gb/s wireline transceiver fabricated in a 7 nm FinFET technology is used as a test vehicle to validate this model. Measured data with two different channels reveals that the statistical model can properly predict the post-FEC error floor with standard FEC codes. While this paper demonstrates the method for capturing DFE error propagation, the method is general and can be applied to model other communication systems having memory effects. Moreover, our proposed model can be easily extended to higher-level PAM schemes and other advanced equalizer architectures to assist in making architectural choices for wireline transceivers.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2943569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2943569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8952842/08879603.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical BER Analysis of Wireline Links With Non-Binary Linear Block Codes Subject to DFE Error Propagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Statistical BER Analysis of Wireline Links With Non-Binary Linear Block Codes Subject to DFE Error Propagation","volume":"67","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879603/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19265598","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879603/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003151","fundingName":"Fonds de Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Nature et Technologies","grantNumber":"208736"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"CRDPJ 505827-16 and CGSD2-518889"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Statistical BER Analysis of Wireline Links With Non-Binary Linear Block Codes Subject to DFE Error Propagation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-yang-2943569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087444S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8952842","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8952842","articleId":"8879603","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879604,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaus Hammler","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8952842/8879604/hamml-2946974-small.gif","p":["Nikolaus Hammler (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in telematics from the Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 2019.","From 2011 to 2012, he was with NXP Semiconductors, Gratkorn, Austria, where he was involved in the development of smartcards and security application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs).

When it is implemented as an RC op-amp circuit, a nonlinear element (the amplifier) is placed within a frequency-dependent feedback loop. Conventional techniques allow us to obtain the nonlinear error easily at certain frequencies only. Furthermore, when the integrator is periodically reset, the circuit is not in steady-state and conventional techniques assuming a steady-state behavior do not apply. It is not obvious how the actual error relates to the circuit parameters when the integrator is driven with a wideband signal. In this paper we present an approach to quickly estimate the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) as a function of the circuit and signal parameters. We show that, to first-order, the NMSE is proportional to the ratio of the signal bandwidth and the dominant pole of the integrator. For an integrator with reset, the signal builds up from zero and results in an additional, integration-time dependent NMSE reduction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879604/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"67","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19265584","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879604/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distortion Analysis of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RC$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Integrators With Wideband Input Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion Analysis of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RC$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Integrators With Wideband Input Signals","sourcePdf":"tcsi-hammler-2946974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103017S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8952842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"8952842","articleId":"8879604","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879606,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong Yong Kong","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic, and Control Engineering, Kongju National University, Cheonan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8952842/8879606/kong-2946584-small.gif","p":["Byeong Yong Kong (S\u201911\u2013M\u201917) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2011, 2013, and 2017, respectively.","From 2017 to 2018, he was a Senior Researcher with the Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, where he was involved in the research of guided missile systems.

Two respective processors for the overlap split and the connected component analysis (CCA) are the key components in a multi-touch detector. Exploiting the simplicity of typical intensity maps in practice, the two processors are first redesigned under a principle that every pixel is processed only once in a raster-scan order. More specifically, the concept of valley point is introduced, and a simple yet effective overlap-split scheme called valley-point division (VPD) is newly developed based on the concept. In addition, equivalent labels in the CCA are handled on the fly instead of being kept to be processed later, and the logics and memories for corner cases that never occur in practice are unloaded. Enabled by the redesign, subsequently, the two processors are integrated into one to concurrently conduct both the VPD and the CCA during the same raster scan. As a result, the proposed detector completes the whole detection procedure with a single raster scan of a map, and is exempted from a large memory required to hold an entire map. Implementation results in a 65-nm CMOS for a large panel of 400 \u00d7 250 sensors demonstrate that the proposed detector takes less than a half latency of the existing ones while occupying only 17% silicon area and consuming 52% power on average.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2946584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2946584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits

To deal with this, we introduce a general framework for the estimation of the transmitter-LIM and LIM-receiver cascaded channel, and propose a two-stage algorithm that includes a sparse matrix factorization stage and a matrix completion stage.

However, those repetitions necessarily increase energy consumption and latency in the whole NB-IoT system. The extent to which the whole system is affected depends on the scheduling of the uplink and downlink channels. We address this question, not treated previously, by developing a tractable model of NB-IoT connectivity, comprising message exchanges in random-access, control, and data channels. The model is then used to analyze the impact of channel scheduling and interaction of coverage classes on the performance of IoT devices through the derivation of the expected latency and battery lifetime. These results are subsequently employed in determining the optimized operation points, i.e., (i) scheduling of data and control channels for a given set of users and respective coverage classes, or (ii) determining the optimal set of coverage classes and served users per coverage class for a given scheduling strategy. Simulations results show the validity of the analysis and confirm that channel scheduling and coexistence of coverage classes significantly affect latency and battery lifetime performance of NB-IoT devices.","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2019.2948591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2019.2948591","startPage":"57","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/9040688/08879621.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9040688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Latency-Energy Performance of NB-IoT Systems in Providing Wide-Area IoT Connectivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"On the Latency-Energy Performance of NB-IoT Systems in Providing Wide-Area IoT Connectivity","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2020","accessionNumber":"19469987","publicationDate":"March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879621/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Service-Oriented Optimization of Green Mobile Networks and Artificial Intelligence for Green Networks Projects"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"648382"},{"fundingName":"Danish Council for Independent Research SEMIOTIC","grantNumber":"8022-00284B"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Latency-Energy Performance of NB-IoT Systems in Providing Wide-Area IoT Connectivity","sourcePdf":"tgcn-azari-2948591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118785S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"9040688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9040688","articleId":"8879621","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879626,"authors":[{"name":"Shiyi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/9046115/8879626/yang-2948853-small.gif","p":["Shiyi Yang received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2000, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering \u2013 systems from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical and mechatronics engineering from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in 2019.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Mechanical Systems Control Group at the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, the University of Waterloo.

The proposed approach attempts to improve the existing shape estimation via tactile exploration, which uses Gaussian process regression for implicit surface modeling with sequential sampling. The main objective is to make the process of sample point selection more efficient and systematic such that the unknown shape can be estimated fast and accurately with highly limited sample points (e.g., less than 1% of the original dataset). Specifically, we propose to select the next best sample point based on two optimization criteria: 1) the mutual information (MI) for uncertainty reduction, and 2) the local curvature for fidelity enhancement. The combination of these two objectives leads to an optimal sampling process that balances between the exploration of the whole shape and the exploitation of the local area where the higher fidelity (or more sampling) is required. Simulation and experimental results successfully demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in terms of estimation speed and accuracy over the conventional methods. Our approach allows us to reconstruct recognizable three dimensional shapes using only around optimally selected 0.4% of the original dataset.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Three-dimensional displays","Estimation","Surface treatment","Mutual information","Ground penetrating radar","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","feature selection","Gaussian processes","image enhancement","image sampling","optimisation","regression analysis","shape recognition","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample point selection","optimization criteria","three dimensional shapes","multifidelity sampling","tactile exploration","touch-down points","Gaussian process regression","implicit surface","sequential sampling","fidelity enhancement","uncertainty reduction","mutual information","implicit surface modeling","Bayesian shape estimation","multifidelity-based optimal sampling method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian process","implicit surface","local curvature","shape estimation","tactile exploration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2948853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/9046115/08879626.pdf","startPage":"4478","endPage":"4488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9046115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2948853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multifidelity Sampling for Fast Bayesian Shape Estimation With Tactile Exploration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multifidelity Sampling for Fast Bayesian Shape Estimation With Tactile Exploration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879626/","volume":"16","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879626/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19548683","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2015-05273, RTI-2018-00414 and STPGP 506987"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000196","fundingName":"Canada Foundation for Innovation","grantNumber":"LOF 30788"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT","grantNumber":"NRF-2018R1A2B6008063"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korea government","grantNumber":"2018R1A4A1025986"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multifidelity Sampling for Fast Bayesian Shape Estimation With Tactile Exploration","sourcePdf":"tii-choi-2948853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08976S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"9046115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9046115","articleId":"8879626","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8879657,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Hua Hu","affiliation":["Rocket Force University of Engineering, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/9123771/8879657/hu-2947839-small.gif","p":["Chang-Hua Hu received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in control science and engineering from the Rocket Force University of Engineering, Xi'an, China, in 1987 and 1990, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China, in 1996.","He is currently a Cheung Kong Professor of Control Science and Engineering with the Rocket Force University of Engineering, Xi'an, China.

The main focus of the RUL prediction is to accurately predict the future failure event, and thus, how to quantify the prediction uncertainty will be a major concern. However, current deep learning based RUL prediction methods are difficult to reflect the uncertainty of the RUL prediction results. Toward this end, we propose a RUL prediction model based on the deep belief network (DBN) and diffusion process (DP) in this article. The proposed method consists of two parts: feature extraction combining DBN and locally linear embedding (LLE), DP-based RUL prediction. In the first part, DBN is used to extract deep hidden features behind the monitoring signals, and then the features with higher tendency are screened as the input of LLE. The health index that can truly reflect the bearing health condition is further determined through LLE. In the second part, a health index evolving model based on DP is presented and the probability density function (PDF) of the predicted RUL is accordingly derived in the sense of the first hitting time (FHT). As such, the proposed method holds promise to improve the prediction accuracy and facilitate the prognostic uncertainty. Finally, experimental studies on the bearing degradation data and the associated comparative analysis verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

wavelength modulated optical fiber-based symmetrical long-range surface plasmon resonance (sLRSPR) biosensor with high quality factor (Q-F) of 56.70 RIU\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n and temperature self-reference was proposed and demonstrated. The multilayered architecture of the sLRSPR biosensor consisted of cladding/dielectric-buffer-layer (DBL)/Au-nanofilm/DBL/analyte, and the DBLs on both sides of the Au-nanofilm were identical, which greatly increased the matching degree of the permittivities of analyte and the DBL near cladding and reduced the loss of long-range surface plasmon-polaritons. Therefore, the sLRSPR sensor displayed excellent sensing performance, and its Q-F was 3.27-folds higher than that of the conventional SPR sensor. Furthermore, the sLRSPR sensor was employed as a biosensor for the measurement of average refractive index (RI) of cell, and the temperature-sensitive optical adsorption characteristic of the DBL was utilized to provide temperature self-reference for the RI measurement. The sLRSPR biosensor realized simultaneous measurement of RI and temperature at the exactly same location, which can eliminate the measurement error introduced by temperature to RI measurement. The sLRSPR biosensor proposed in this paper possessed higher detection precision and presented greatly promising application prospects in the field of biochemistry.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/8599030/08879659.pdf","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1143","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2019.2947697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2019.2947697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8599030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Fiber-Based Symmetrical Long-Range Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor With High Quality Factor and Temperature Self-Reference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Fiber-Based Symmetrical Long-Range Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor With High Quality Factor and Temperature Self-Reference","htmlLink":"/document/8879659/","publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2019","accessionNumber":"19124329","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N180402023 and N172002001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Fiber-Based Symmetrical Long-Range Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor With High Quality Factor and Temperature Self-Reference","sourcePdf":"tnano-jing-2947697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08377S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"8599030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8599030","articleId":"8879659","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8879661,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbin Qiu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/9119488/8879661/qiu-2944761-small.gif","p":["Jianbin Qiu (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechatronics engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2009.","He is currently a Full Professor with the School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China.

This digital OPM is entirely based on the fixed-point unrolled and pipelined radix-2 COordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm, which is suitable for outphasing transmitters based on both IQ and phase modulation architectures. The outphasing angle is calculated by a mixture of single-CORDIC and double-CORDIC algorithm, which significantly reduces the critical path delay. Due to architectural advantages, its error performance, sampling rate, power efficiency, and area efficiency are improved. According to FPGA implementation measurements, this architecture enables a 12-bit OPM to achieve error vector magnitude (EVM) of 0.062% and peak sampling rate of 0.74 GSample/s.

An iterative search strategy based on dichotomy is proposed to provide a finite number of rotor position angles with good accuracy. These position angles are used to calculate the back electromotive force (EMF) in d-axis. The optimal rotor position angle is the one that yields a back EMF minimizing the defined cost function. With the increase of the iterations, the accuracy of rotor position angle increases geometrically. To effectively extract the back EMF signal under the low-speed condition, the high-frequency signal injection method is used to realize the low-speed operation of the motor. A hybrid control strategy is adopted to achieve the smooth switching from the low-speed to high-speed. The performance of the proposed method has been validated experimentally and compared with that of the conventional phase locked loop under different conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2019.2947875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2019.2947875","startPage":"6089","endPage":"6100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/9034213/08879664.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9034213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speed Sensorless Control for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors Based on Finite Position Set","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Speed Sensorless Control for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors Based on Finite Position Set","volume":"67","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2020","accessionNumber":"19449329","publicationDate":"July 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879664/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51875261"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20180046 and BK20170071"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","grantNumber":"17KJA460005"},{"fundingName":"Six Categories Talent Peak of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"2015-XNYQC-003"},{"fundingName":"Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"SJCX19_0574"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speed Sensorless Control for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors Based on Finite Position Set","sourcePdf":"tie-sun-2947875-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110303S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"9034213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"9034213","articleId":"8879664","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879668,"authors":[{"name":"Fen Fang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8835130/8879668/fang-2947792-small.gif","p":["Fen Fang received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering, majoring in computer graphics, from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2014.

Elongated objects are examples. To address the problem of low ORPs for elongated object detection, we propose a hybrid approach which employs a Faster R-CNN to achieve robust detections of object parts, and a novel model-driven clustering algorithm to group the related partial detections and suppress false detections. First, we train a Faster R-CNN with partial region proposals of suitable and stable ORPs. Next, we introduce a deep CNN (DCNN) for orientation classification on the partial detections. Then, on the outputs of the Faster R-CNN and DCNN, the algorithm of adaptive model-driven clustering first initializes a model of an elongated object with a data-driven process on local partial detections, and refines the model iteratively by model-driven clustering and data-driven model updating. By exploiting Faster R-CNN to produce robust partial detections and model-driven clustering to form a global representation, our method is able to generate a tight oriented bounding box for elongated object detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two typical elongated objects in the COCO dataset, and other typical elongated objects, including rigid objects (pens, screwdrivers and wrenches) and non-rigid objects (cracks). Experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a large margin of improvements for both detection and localization of elongated objects in images.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2019.2947792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2019.2947792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8835130/08879668.pdf","startPage":"2052","endPage":"2065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8835130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","displayDocTitle":"Combining Faster R-CNN and Model-Driven Clustering for Elongated Object Detection","volume":"29","pubMedId":"31647436","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19463411","htmlLink":"/document/8879668/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2019","publicationDate":"2020","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"A*STAR AME Programmatic, Singapore","grantNumber":"A18A2b0046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Faster R-CNN and Model-Driven Clustering for Elongated Object Detection","sourcePdf":"tip-fang-2947792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139946S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8835130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8835130","articleId":"8879668","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879680,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University (BUAA), Beijing, China","Ningbo Institute of Technology, Beihang University (BUAA), Ningbo, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/9123771/8879680/liu-2947852-small.gif","p":["Gang Liu received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees in industrial automation, from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 1992 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in water conservancy and hydropower engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2001.","He is currently a Ph.D. Supervisor with the School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University (BUAA), Beijing, China, in 2008.

At the same time, the main sources of unbalance vibration are also analyzed. Finally, an improved adaptive notch filter based on double input is designed. The filter takes the rotor radial X, Y two-channel displacement sensor signals as inputs, and uses the characteristics orthogonal to each other to simultaneously enter the system. The rotor can be automatically balanced by adjusting the convergence factor and the compensation angle to adaptively suppress the synchronous current in a widely operating speed range. Simulation and experimental results show that the method can effectively eliminate the synchronous current in a widely operating speed range and improve the stability of the system.

By defining a virtually desired sideslip angle of which the tangent-nonlinearity is exactly identified by a finite-time sideslip observer, the hyperbolic-tangent LOS (HLOS) guidance laws collaboratively governing heading, surge, and virtual ship velocity are devised in a finite-time manner such that cross-track error sensitively excites heading guidance. With the aid of nonsmooth auxiliary dynamics, guidance errors are finely dominated with finite-time convergence. Finite-time heading and surge controllers are further synthesized by integral and nonsingular terminal sliding-mode techniques, and ensure that HLOS guidance signals can be exactly tracked, whereby complex unknowns are exactly compensated by finite-time unknown observer. Eventually, nonsmooth analysis together with Lyapunov approach guarantees that the entire HLOS-FPF scheme is globally finite-time stable and contributes to exact path-following under heading-surge collaborative guidance. Simulation results and comprehensive comparisons with typical methods demonstrate remarkable superiority of the innovative HLOS-FPF scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2020","volume":"67","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"19727963","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2020","publicationDate":"Oct. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879681/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hyperbolic-Tangent LOS Guidance-Based Finite-Time Path Following of Underactuated Marine Vehicles","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51009017 and 51379002"},{"fundingName":"Dalian Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2016RJ10"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012591","fundingName":"Program for Liaoning Innovative Talents in University","grantNumber":"LR2017024"},{"fundingName":"Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program","grantNumber":"XLYC1807013"},{"fundingName":"Stable Supporting Fund of Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Laboratory","grantNumber":"SXJQR2018WDKT03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3132019344"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A1A1A05001325"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperbolic-Tangent LOS Guidance-Based Finite-Time Path Following of Underactuated Marine Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tie-wang-2947845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119793S","chronDate":"Oct.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"9123771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"9123771","articleId":"8879681","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879693,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Shen","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8879693/shen-2947591-small.gif","p":["Yifei Shen (S\u201918) is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)."]},"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086423399"},{"name":"Yuanming Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8952731/8879693/shi-2947591-small.gif","p":["Yuanming Shi (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), in 2015.

Machine learning-based methods have recently emerged as a disruptive way to obtain near-optimal performance for MINLPs with affordable computational complexity. There have been some attempts in applying such methods to resource management in wireless networks, but these attempts require huge amounts of training samples and lack the capability to handle constrained problems. Furthermore, they suffer from severe performance deterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens and is referred to as the task mismatch problem. In this paper, to reduce the sample complexity and address the feasibility issue, we propose a framework of Learning to Optimize for Resource Management (LORM). In contrast to the end-to-end learning approach adopted in previous studies, LORM learns the optimal pruning policy in the branch-and-bound algorithm for MINLPs via a sample-efficient method, namely, imitation learning. To further address the task mismatch problem, we develop a transfer learning method via self-imitation in LORM, named LORM-TL, which can quickly adapt a pre-trained machine learning model to the new task with only a few additional unlabeled training samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that LORM outperforms specialized state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves near-optimal performance, while providing significant speedup compared with the branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, LORM-TL, by relying on a few unlabeled samples, achieves comparable performance with the model trained from scratch with sufficient labeled samples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08879693.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2947591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2947591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LORM: Learning to Optimize for Resource Management in Wireless Networks With Few Training Samples","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Machine learning algorithms","Wireless networks","Training","Machine learning","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","integer programming","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear programming","radio networks","telecommunication computing","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-to-end learning approach","optimal pruning policy","branch-and-bound algorithm","MINLP","sample-efficient method","imitation learning","task mismatch problem","transfer learning method","named LORM-TL","pre-trained machine","additional unlabeled training samples","achieves near-optimal performance","unlabeled samples","sufficient labeled samples","wireless networks","effective resource management","mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems","machine learning-based methods","affordable computational complexity","constrained problems","severe performance deterioration","network parameters change","sample complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation","mixed-integer nonlinear programming","wireless communications","few-shot learning","transfer learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"LORM: Learning to Optimize for Resource Management in Wireless Networks With Few Training Samples","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8879693/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19262642","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"General Research Funding from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"16210719"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601290"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LORM: Learning to Optimize for Resource Management in Wireless Networks With Few Training Samples","sourcePdf":"twc-zhang-2947591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161313S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8879693","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879695,"authors":[{"name":"Liying Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/9184294/8879695/zhu-2940466-small.gif","p":["Liying Zhu received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Ludong University, Yantai, China, in 1995, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2007.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), Jinan.

To be practical, imperfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) are taken into account. More particularly, two representative NOMA scenarios are proposed, namely non-cooperative NOMA and cooperative NOMA. For the non-cooperative NOMA, the base station (BS) directly performs NOMA with all users. For the cooperative NOMA, the BS communicates with NOMA users with the aid of an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay, and the direct links between BS and users are existent. To characterize the performance of the proposed networks, new closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and energy efficiency (EE) are derived, respectively. Specifically, we also design the relay location optimization algorithms from the perspectives of minimize the asymptotic OP. For non-cooperative NOMA, it is proved that the OP at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is a function of threshold, distortion noises, estimation errors and fading parameters, which results in 0 diversity order. In addition, high SNR slopes and high SNR power offsets achieved by users are studied. It is shown that there are rate ceilings for the EC at high SNRs due to estimation error and distortion noise, which cause 0 high SNR slopes and \u221e high SNR power offsets. For cooperative NOMA, similar results can be obtained, and it also demonstrates that the outage performance of cooperative NOMA scenario exceeds the non-cooperative NOMA scenario in the high SNR regime.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2947670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2947670","startPage":"680","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8952731/08879698.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residual Transceiver Hardware Impairments on Cooperative NOMA Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Residual Transceiver Hardware Impairments on Cooperative NOMA Networks","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2020","accessionNumber":"19262620","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879698/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Henan Scientific and Technological Research Project","grantNumber":"182102210307"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Henan Province","grantNumber":"NSFRF180309"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003488","fundingName":"Henan Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"J2019-4"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601414"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P009719/2"},{"fundingName":"H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015","grantNumber":"690750"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual Transceiver Hardware Impairments on Cooperative NOMA Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2947670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.233049S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8952731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"8952731","articleId":"8879698","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879699,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8946860/8879699/liu-2944821-small.gif","p":["Xin Liu received the B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2017.

The proposed DPD can solve the hardware implementation issue of conventional DPD architecture in HBF array by estimating and linearizing the main beam signal while avoiding the complex feedback configurations. Different from the far-field OTA measurements, the OTA feedback receivers are placed symmetrically inside the transmit array according to its geometric structure. Theoretical analysis proves that it is possible to derive the main beam signal from the OTA feedback information directly by adjusting the phase shifter of each branch using a relative simple procedure which allows the predistorter to be identified based on the estimated main beam signal. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm for eliminating uncorrelated coupling interference from other subarrays in the feedback signal is proposed. Measurement results on a 1 \u00d7 4 transmitter and a 2 \u00d7 3 transmitter as well as simulations on a 4 \u00d7 64 array are presented to benchmark the proposed DPD technique against the existing techniques. Better than 15-dB adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) improvement has been realized with the proposed DPD.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8946860/08879699.pdf","startPage":"5235","endPage":"5248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2019.2944821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2019.2944821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8946860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearization for Hybrid Beamforming Array Utilizing Embedded Over-the-Air Diversity Feedbacks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Receivers","Antenna arrays","Antenna feeds","Feedback loop","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","feedback","iterative methods","linearisation techniques","phase shifters","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearization","hybrid beamforming array","over-the-air diversity feedbacks","modified beam-oriented digital predistortion","hybrid beamforming large-scale array","hardware implementation issue","conventional DPD architecture","HBF array","complex feedback configurations","far-field OTA measurements","OTA feedback receivers","transmit array","OTA feedback information","feedback signal","OTA DFB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion (DPD)","hybrid beamforming (HBF) array","massive multi-in multi-out (mMIMO)","over-theair diversity feedbacks (OTA DFBs)","power amplifiers (PAs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","displayDocTitle":"Linearization for Hybrid Beamforming Array Utilizing Embedded Over-the-Air Diversity Feedbacks","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8879699/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19244221","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801603 and 2017YFF0206201"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001024"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801259"},{"fundingName":"Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearization for Hybrid Beamforming Array Utilizing Embedded Over-the-Air Diversity Feedbacks","sourcePdf":"tmtt-liu-2944821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086949S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8946860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8946860","articleId":"8879699","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":8879704,"authors":[{"name":"Hongfeng You","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8964506/8879704/you-2945591-small.gif","p":["Hongfeng You was born in Nantong, Jiangsu, China, in 1991.

Using a single model or a traditional sequential joint model, it is easy to lose deep features during feature mining. This article proposes a new feature extraction method that uses the word embedding method from natural language processing to generate bidirectional real dense vectors to reflect the contextual relationships between the pixels. A bidirectional independent recurrent neural network (BiIndRNN) is combined with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the sliced recurrent neural network (SRNN) algorithm model, which is then constructed in parallel with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) under an attention mechanism to fully exploit the deep features of images and to capture the semantic information of the context.

Under this regime, the modules at the two ends of a mesochronous interface receive the same clock signal, thus operating under the same clock frequency, but the edges of the arriving clock signals may exhibit an unknown phase relationship. In such cases, clock synchronization is needed when sending data across modules. In this brief, we present a novel mesochronous dual-clock first-input-first-output (FIFO) buffer that can handle both clock synchronization and temporary data storage, by synchronizing data implicitly through the explicit synchronization of only the flow-control signals. The proposed design can operate correctly even when the transmitter and the receiver are separated by a long link whose delay cannot fit within the target operating frequency. In such scenarios, the proposed mesochronous FIFO can be extended to support multicycle link delays in a modular manner and with minimal modifications to the baseline architecture. When compared with the other state-of-the-art dual-clock mesochronous FIFO designs, the new architecture is demonstrated to yield a substantially lower cost implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","volume":"28","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19245084","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8879706/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Mesochronous Dual-Clock FIFO Buffer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Mesochronous Dual-Clock FIFO Buffer","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-dimitrakopoulos-2946348-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056072S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8945454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8945454","articleId":"8879706","onlineDate":"22 October 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8879774,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Khavalko","affiliation":["Lviv Polytechnic National University, Lviv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Khavalko","id":"37085793165"},{"name":"Ivan Tsmots","affiliation":["Lviv Polytechnic National University, Lviv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Tsmots","id":"37704053400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3883-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8879774","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879774","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Biological neural networks","Task analysis","Image segmentation","Streaming media","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","autoassociative neural network","geometric transformations","image recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image classification","neural network","image recognition","system of technical vision","model of successive geometric transformations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879774","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869682/8879768/08879774.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 2nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 2nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","startPage":"1118","endPage":"1121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8879768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Classification and Recognition on the Base of Autoassociative Neural Network Usage","abstract":"The problem of images classification is considered.

Track circuits are a key component of automatic train control system and used to detect whether the rail section is free or occupied. Amplitude-modulated signals used in track circuits have low noise immunity, therefore the power wide-band-frequency interference generated by an electrified railway can cause failure operation of track circuits. To ensure the safety of the track circuits, they are subjected to periodic maintenance with registration of the signal current to the computer and measurements of its parameters. The detection of time intervals during which the interference in the track circuits exceeds certain limit values is performed by simple visual analysis of the recorded signal and is time consuming and expensive. In order to automate the revealing and identification of disturbances in audio frequency track circuits with values exceeding the certain level, a new method for processing of the recorded signal have been proposed. At the first stage, the segments of a signal with interference exceeding a certain permissible level are revealed using the wavelet packet energy Shannon entropy. At the second stage, for the revealed segment with disturbances, a detailed analysis of the signal should be carried out using the digital wavelet packet transform to determine the type and parameters of the disturbances. For automatic identification of the track circuits signal disturbances, an artificial neural network classifier has been used. As a result of investigation the features of the signal disturbances in audio frequency track circuits have been extracted. The processing of the track circuits signals in accordance with the proposed method show high effectiveness in the revealing and identification of the signal disturbances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audio Frequency Track Circuits Monitoring Based on Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network Classifier","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 2nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","doi":"10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879833","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 2nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869682/8879768/08879833.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8879768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Audio Frequency Track Circuits Monitoring Based on Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network Classifier","conferenceDate":"2-6 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8879833/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"19082661","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audio Frequency Track Circuits Monitoring Based on Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network Classifier","confLoc":"Lviv, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"0491-0496-031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053256S","chronDate":"2-6 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8869682","isNumber":"8879768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869682","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8879768","articleId":"8879833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8879867,"authors":[{"name":"Vladyslav Yaloveha","affiliation":["National Technical University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Vladyslav","lastName":"Yaloveha","id":"37087061144"},{"name":"Daria Hlavcheva","affiliation":["National Technical University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Daria","lastName":"Hlavcheva","id":"37087058377"},{"name":"Andrii Podorozhniak","affiliation":["National Technical University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Andrii","lastName":"Podorozhniak","id":"37086364335"},{"name":"Heorhii Kuchuk","affiliation":["National Technical University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Heorhii","lastName":"Kuchuk","id":"37086422142"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3883-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8879867","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earth","Remote sensing","Indexes","Convolutional neural networks","Biological neural networks","Forestry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","environmental science computing","hazards","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis","wildfires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capsule neural networks","fire hazardous forest areas","deep learning artificial neural networks","mathematical statistics methods","convolutional neural networks","fire hazard research","camp fire area","multispectral image recognition method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Earth remote sensing","multispectral images","convolutional neural networks","capsule neural networks","wildfires"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879867","abstract":"The scientific and practical problem of detecting fire hazardous forest areas by using deep learning artificial neural networks applied to Camp Fire (California, USA) is considered in the paper.

Special attention is paid to the peculiarities of acquisition measurements from sensor and further transfer obtained data to the processing software. We devise general approach to fetching data from sensor and then implement it for two control modules - microcontroller and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). According to the proposed dataflow, general structure of the system is suggested. Mathematical apparatus for assessment of the expected throughput has been provided for the specific sensor to evaluate performance of the system on the lowest level. For practical testing, image sensor TSL3301 from AMS company was employed. Results of image acquisition under different configuration settings and comparative analysis of the images are provided in the paper. To complete the whole processing flow we implemented software that assembles image from sensor measurements and visualizes data. The proposed technology stack for image sensor system is intended to be used as fundamental part for intellectual functions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8879768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879934","doi":"10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879934","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 2nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 2nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8869682/8879768/08879934.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"694","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Clocks","Software","Throughput","Protocols","Data acquisition","Organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","image sensors","microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TSL3301 image sensor","assembled image","image sensor system","data visualization","sensor measurements","processing flow","image acquisition","field-programmable gate array","microcontroller","fetching data","processing software","acquisition measurements","image processing system","image sensor data processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image sensor","processing","system","measurement","acquisition"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dataflow and System Organization for Image Sensor Data Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8879934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Dataflow and System Organization for Image Sensor Data Processing","htmlLink":"/document/8879934/","accessionNumber":"19082668","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","conferenceDate":"2-6 July 2019","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dataflow and System Organization for Image Sensor Data Processing","confLoc":"Lviv, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"0689-0694-072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049707S","chronDate":"2-6 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8869682","isNumber":"8879768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8869682","xplore-issue":"8879768","articleId":"8879934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":8879950,"authors":[{"name":"Andrii Rubel","affiliation":["National Aerospace University \u201cKhAI\u201d, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Andrii","lastName":"Rubel","id":"37085792019"},{"name":"Oleksii Rubel","affiliation":["National Aerospace University \u201cKhAI\u201d, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Oleksii","lastName":"Rubel","id":"37085582295"},{"name":"Victoriya Abramova","affiliation":["National Aerospace University \u201cKhAI\u201d, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Victoriya","lastName":"Abramova","id":"38244857000"},{"name":"Galina Proskura","affiliation":["National Aerospace University \u201cKhAI\u201d, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Galina","lastName":"Proskura","id":"37086364857"},{"name":"Vladimir Lukin","affiliation":["National Aerospace University \u201cKhAI\u201d, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Lukin","id":"37284917600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3882-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3883-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8879950","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8879950","abstract":"Image quality assessment plays a key role to provide high Quality of Experience (QoE) in image processing applications, especially where the end user is a human. Among different distortions that may appear during image acquisition, noise is the most annoying one. In this study, we predict values of full-reference image quality metrics (FR IQA) for noisy images corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) without any access to the reference (noise-free) image. Prediction is carried out using energy allocation features extracted from discrete cosine transform domain as well as a priori known noise variance. Multilayer perceptrons are used to map the features from noisy images into FR IQA scores. It is shown that the use of a priori known noise variance significantly improves prediction accuracy. The influence of noise variance estimation errors on prediction accuracy is analyzed. The source codes along with the demo Android application, full datasets and supplementary materials will be available online at
