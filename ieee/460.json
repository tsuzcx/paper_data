It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04600004.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARSoS: An Adaptive, Robust, and Sub-Optimal Strategy for Automated Deployment of Anomaly Detection System in MANETs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acquired immune deficiency syndrome","Sensors","Mobile computing","Ad hoc networks","Robustness","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","mobile radio","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARSoS","anomaly detection system","MANET","anomaly-based intrusion detection system","optimization problem","online policy gradient algorithm","mobile ad-hoc networks","adaptive strategy","robust strategy","sub-optimal strategy","AIDS sensor","decentralized decision problem","global detection measures","local observations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"ARSoS: An Adaptive, Robust, and Sub-Optimal Strategy for Automated Deployment of Anomaly Detection System in MANETs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600004/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152707","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARSoS: An Adaptive, Robust, and Sub-Optimal Strategy for Automated Deployment of Anomaly Detection System in MANETs","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"02-05-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070538S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4600004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600006,"authors":[{"name":"Deepali Arora","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Deepali","lastName":"Arora","id":"37414859500"},{"name":"Pan Agathoklis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Agathoklis","id":"38560075000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4600006","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Arrays","Directive antennas","Gain","Antennas","Mobile communication","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiocommunication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden beam problem","modified beamformer","beamforming technique","transmission sensing","mobile terminals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600006","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.107","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","abstract":"A beamforming technique is proposed to solve the hidden beam problem in systems relying on sensing the medium.

In addition, we formulated an optimization problem for an adaptive allocation for the subcarriers, paths, and power so that the system capacity could be maximized while minimum resources are guaranteed for each user. Since the optimization problem should be performed in real-time, a heuristic algorithm was recently proposed as a means of reducing the complexity. However, the implementation in cooperative OFDMA systems with radio frequency (RF) relays is not appropriate; moreover, the quantity of feedback is excessive for real-time operation, and the relay load balancing scheme is iterative and slightly inefficient. Thus, we propose an improved heuristic resource allocation algorithm that performs better than the conventional scheme. The proposed algorithm is suitable for cooperative OFDMA systems with RF relays; furthermore, it can reduce the complexity and increase the capacity.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.129","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04600028.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Resource Allocation Algorithm with Increasing Capacity in Cooperative OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600028/","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Resource Allocation Algorithm with Increasing Capacity in Cooperative OFDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152726","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600028/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Resource Allocation Algorithm with Increasing Capacity in Cooperative OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"02-10-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056153S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4600028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600038,"authors":[{"name":"Jyh-Horng Wen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tunghai University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyh-Horng","lastName":"Wen","id":"37278936100"},{"name":"Gwo-Ruey Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Gwo-Ruey","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293699800"},{"name":"Chih-Chung Kung","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chung","lastName":"Kung","id":"37688438400"},{"name":"Cheng-Ying Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Taipei Municipal University of Education, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ying","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291797000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4600038","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Encoding","Artificial neural networks","Parity check codes","Receivers","Converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio reduction","OFDM systems","parity check coding","selected mapping","phase rotation","data position permutation","IEEE 802.11g","PAPR reduction"]}],"abstract":"High PAPR of the transmitted signal is a major drawback in the OFDM systems.

Compared to existing TPA methods for MIMO-THP systems, the proposed scheme reduces processing complexity and improves the BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.153","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04600052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","startPage":"888","endPage":"892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Minimum BER Power Allocation for MIMO-THP System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Minimum BER Power Allocation for MIMO-THP System","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600052/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145189","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600052/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Minimum BER Power Allocation for MIMO-THP System","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"03-03-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055383S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4600052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4600053,"authors":[{"name":"Junyi Wang","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Junyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406465900"},{"name":"Jiang Liu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598329500"},{"name":"Takuro Sato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuro","lastName":"Sato","id":"38266678500"},{"name":"Athanasios Vasilakos","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Western Macedonia, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Vasilakos","id":"37282616800"},{"name":"Kiyomichi Araki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electric and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyomichi","lastName":"Araki","id":"37270249500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4600053","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"The paper describes a low complexity tree-structure based user scheduling algorithm in a MLD-based multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems. An M-branch selection algorithm, which selects M most-possible best branches at each step, is proposed to maximize the whole system sum-rate capacity. To make this work more feasible, some implementation problems such as complexity reduction, power control and performance distortion of channel estimation are also discussed in this paper. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the complexity of proposed scheme, linearly increases with the number of user candidates and the number of antennas to be selected and is much lower than full research algorithm. Furthermore the algorithm can also be performed independently with power control and is robust to the channel estimation error.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04600053.pdf","startPage":"893","endPage":"898","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree-Structured User Scheduling Algorithm and Its Implementation in Multi-User MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Complexity theory","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Equations","Power control","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tree-structured user scheduling algorithm","multiuser MIMO Systems","tree-structure complexity","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems","channel estimation error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Tree-Structured User Scheduling Algorithm and Its Implementation in Multi-User MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600053/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152745","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-Structured User Scheduling Algorithm and Its Implementation in Multi-User MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"03-03-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08695S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4600053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4600056,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Torabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique De Montreal, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Torabi","id":"37298395800"},{"name":"Wessam Ajib","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universite du Quebec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Ajib","id":"37294527900"},{"name":"David Haccoun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique De Montreal, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Haccoun","id":"37276818400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4600056","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Modulation","MIMO","Probability density function","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","Nakagami channels","probability","scheduling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user scheduling","distributed Nakagami-m fading channels","multiuser MIMO system","absolute SNR-based scheduling","normalized SNR-based scheduling","heterogeneous wireless network","spectral efficiency","bit error rate","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a performance analysis of user scheduling over independent and non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels for multiuser MIMO systems exploiting the multiuser and antenna diversities while maintaining fairness among the users.

On the other hand, recent advances in signal processing combined with those in antenna technology provide MIMO capabilities, thereby creating opportunities for enhancing the throughput of wireless networks. Both SDRs and MIMO together enable next-generation wireless networks, such as mesh networks, to support dynamic and adaptive bandwidth sharing along time, frequency, and space. In this paper, we design and model the radio and interference constraints on multi-hop wireless networks when they are both SDR-capable and MIMO-equipped.

OFDM is combined with multiple antennas to increase data diversity gain on a time varying multipath fading channel, resulting in a MIMO-OFDM system. A set of fast time-varying and frequency-selective fading channels is considered. The proposed pilot assisted transmission scheme multiplexes known symbols with information bearing data to estimate the channel in the presence of inter symbol interference (ISI). The channel is assumed to be unchanged for the duration of one OFDM block and change independently from one OFDM block to the other. The number of pilot symbols for each OFDM block is held constant and the symbols are dispersed throughout the block for efficient channel estimation. However, equally distributing the total power between the data and pilots doesn't optimize the transmission over a frequency-selective fading channel. We propose an optimal power allocation scheme for the joint pilot placement and space frequency code design scheme based on the channel response and the bit error rate (BER) values. This leads to substantial improvement in performance for a 2 times 2 MIMO-OFDM system. The results can be extended to MIMO-OFDM systems with any number of transmit and receive antennas.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.166","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04600065.pdf","startPage":"960","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimal Pilot Placement and Space Frequency (SF) Code Design for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600065/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimal Pilot Placement and Space Frequency (SF) Code Design for MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152756","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600065/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimal Pilot Placement and Space Frequency (SF) Code Design for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"03-05-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0489S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4600065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600067,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Berkmann","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Berkmann","id":"37375105800"},{"name":"Cecilia Carbonelli","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Cecilia","lastName":"Carbonelli","id":"37268228400"},{"name":"Frank Dietrich","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Dietrich","id":"37285016200"},{"name":"Christian Drewes","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Drewes","id":"37298721800"},{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278552800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4600067","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":2187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Channel estimation","Receivers","Decoding","Complexity theory","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","decoding","equalisers","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G LTE terminal","OFDMA","MIMO downlink","SCFDMA","channel estimation","equalisation","turbo decoder","frequency domain processing","computational complexity","3GPP air interface","E-UTRAN"]}],"abstract":"Currently, 3GPP standardizes an evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) within the Release 8 Long Term Evolution (LTE) project. Targets include higher spectral efficiency, lower latency, higher peak data rate when compared to previous 3GPP air interfaces. The air interface of E-UTRAN is based on OFDMA and MIMO in downlink and on SCFDMA in uplink Main challenges for a terminal implementation include efficient realization of the inner receiver, especially for channel estimation and equalisation, and the outer receiver including a turbo decoder which needs to handle data rates of up to 75 Mbps per spatial MIMO stream. We show that the inner receiver can nicely and straightforwardly be parallelized due to frequency domain processing. In addition to the computational complexity of even a simple linear equaliser, one of the challenges is an efficient implementation considering necessary flexibility for different MIMO modes, power consumption and silicon area.

Our numerical evaluations show the impacts of different parameters of the propagation environment on the doppler PSD. More importantly, we find that the shapes of the Doppler PSD are completely different according to single- or double-bounced rays for M2M channels, while they are exactly the same for fixed- to-mobile (F2M) channels.

Importantly, the model can easily be adapted to a variety of M2M propagation environments, e.g., outdoor macro-, micro, and pico-cells taking into account different vehicle traffic densities, by adjusting model parameters. From the proposed model, the space-time (ST) correlation function (CF) and the corresponding space-Doppler (SD) power spectral density (PSD) of any two sub-channels are derived for a two-dimensional (2D) non-isotropic scattering environment.

It has been reported that time-of-arrival based localization techniques perform superior compared to received signal strength techniques or angle-of-arrival techniques. However, the accuracy of such systems is limited mainly due to unexpected large ranging errors observed in indoor environment which are mainly caused by obstruction of the direct path by a metallic object. The analysis of effects of the micro-metallic objects on the accuracy of the range estimates are shown to be a very challenging problem. In this paper we discuss some full-wave EM methods to analyze the effects of micro-metallic objects on the accuracy of the range estimates. The results of electromagnetic simulation via FDTD are compared to the channel profiles obtained from a real-time frequency-domain measurement to analyze the accuracy of a 2D approximation used. The measurements were conducted with the bandwidth of 500 MHz centered around 1 GHz. The FDTD simulation was carried out using our MATLAB FDTD Suite.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.193","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04600092.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Effects of Micro-Metal on Ranging Error Using Finite Difference Time Domain Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600092/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Effects of Micro-Metal on Ranging Error Using Finite Difference Time Domain Methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152762","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600092/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Effects of Micro-Metal on Ranging Error Using Finite Difference Time Domain Methods","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"03-11-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060263S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4600092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600093,"authors":[{"name":"Lama Nachman","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lama","lastName":"Nachman","id":"37295494200"},{"name":"Jonathan Huang","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37423896600"},{"name":"Junaith Shahabdeen","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Junaith","lastName":"Shahabdeen","id":"37689033800"},{"name":"Robert Adler","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Adler","id":"37427199700"},{"name":"Ralph Kling","affiliation":["Crossbow Technology, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Kling","id":"37295495600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4600093","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Wireless sensor networks","Throughput","Energy consumption","Energy efficiency","Real time systems","Data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Imote2","wireless sensor network application","second generation Intel mote platform","low rate sampling","edge data processing"]}],"abstract":"While the majority of sensor network application research to date has focused on applications where the controlling processor need only be capable of handling simple communications and data primitives required for low rate sampling, comparatively few researchers have targeted the other end of the spectrum; applications where there is a significant advantage to performing data processing at the edge of the network.

This paper gives a survey of fall detection for elderly and patient, focusing on identifying approaches and principles of the existing fall detection methods. To properly build the classification tree of the methods of fall detection we first study the characteristics of fall. Then according to what sensors and how sensors are used we first divide the methods of fall detection into three approaches: wearable device, ambience device, and camera-based. Further we divide each approach into two to three classes according to the used principles. For each class of algorithm we analyze their merits and demerits. We also give comments on how we can improve some algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cameras","Hidden Markov models","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Medical services","Biomedical imaging","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","geriatrics","patient care"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fall detection","elderly","patient care","healthcare industry","classification tree","wearable device","ambience device","camera-based device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fall Detection","Algorithm","System","Device","Approach","Principle","Healthcare","Sensor","Camera","Elderly","Patient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600107","doi":"10.1109/HEALTH.2008.4600107","displayPublicationTitle":"HealthCom 2008 - 10th International Conference on e-health Networking, Applications and Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591417/4600097/04600107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HEALTH.2008.4600107","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600097","publicationTitle":"HealthCom 2008 - 10th International Conference on e-health Networking, Applications and Services","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaches and principles of fall detection for elderly and patient","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approaches and principles of fall detection for elderly and patient","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600107/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600107/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10152122","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaches and principles of fall detection for elderly and patient","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp010-1569096397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100703S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4591417","isNumber":"4600097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591417","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4600097","articleId":"4600107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4600127,"authors":[{"name":"Geng Yang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"lastName":"Geng Yang","id":"37087719251"},{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"lastName":"Jian Chen","id":"37087667482"},{"name":"Ying Cao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"lastName":"Ying Cao","id":"37087721364"},{"name":"Hannu Tenhunen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"lastName":"Hannu Tenhunen","id":"37087174072"},{"name":"Li-Rong Zheng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"lastName":"Li-Rong Zheng","id":"37087174288"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2280-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2281-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4600127","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":681},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Electrodes","Monitoring","Biomedical monitoring","Random access memory","Artificial intelligence","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","electrocardiography","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable ECG monitoring system","Active-Cable","intelligent electrodes","Xilinx FPGAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECG monitoring","wearable device","Active-Cable","intelligent electrode"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HEALTH.2008.4600127","publicationTitle":"HealthCom 2008 - 10th International Conference on e-health Networking, Applications and Services","displayPublicationTitle":"HealthCom 2008 - 10th International Conference on e-health Networking, Applications and Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591417/4600097/04600127.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HEALTH.2008.4600127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel wearable ECG monitoring system based on active-cable and intelligent electrodes","abstract":"In this paper, a novel wearable electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring system is presented.

In this architecture, 16 quadrature amplitude modulation intensity-modulated OFDM signals at 10 Gb/s are utilized for downstream transmission. A wavelength-reuse scheme is employed to carry the upstream data to reduce the cost at optical network unit. By using one intensity modulator, the downstream signal is remodulated for upstream on-off keying (OOK) data at 2.5 Gb/s based on its return-to-zero shape waveform. We have also studied the fading effect caused by double-sideband (DSB) downstream signals. Measurement results show that 2.5-dB power penalty is caused by the fading effect. The fading effect can be removed when the DSB OFDM downstream signals are converted to single sideband (SSB) after vestigial filtering. The power penalty is negligible for both SSB OFDM downstream and the remodulated OOK upstream signals after over 25-km standard single-mode-fiber transmission.

It is well known that such codes are amenable to iterative (sum-product) decoding on the Tanner graph of the code, yet are as readily encodable as turbo codes. In this paper, interleavers for RA codes are designed using combinatorial techniques as a basis for deterministic interleaver constructions, yielding RA codes whose Tanner graphs are free of 4-cycles. Further, a generalized RA code accumulator structure is proposed, leading to codes, termed w3RA codes, whose parity-check matrices have many fewer weight-2 columns than conventional RA codes. The w3RA codes retain the low-complexity encoding of conventional RA codes and exhibit improved error-floor performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.041247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4600165/04600167.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.041247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combinatorial Interleavers for Systematic Regular Repeat-Accumulate Codes [Transactions Letters]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Combinatorial Interleavers for Systematic Regular Repeat-Accumulate Codes [Transactions Letters]","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600167/","accessionNumber":"10330931","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combinatorial Interleavers for Systematic Regular Repeat-Accumulate Codes [Transactions Letters]","sourcePdf":"tc_0808_1201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06265S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4600165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4600165","articleId":"4600167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600168,"authors":[{"name":"Yibo Jiang","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, San Diego, USA","Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yibo","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37558429500"},{"name":"Alexei Ashikhmin","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Alexei","lastName":"Ashikhmin","id":"37272162900"},{"name":"Naresh Sharma","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies, Open Innovations Laboratory, Whippany, NJ, USA","Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Naresh","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37270371500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4600168","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":648},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we design capacity approaching low- density parity-check (LDPC) codes in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime for flat Rayleigh fading channels with channel side information at transmitter and receiver.

In particular, the proposed scheme is applicable even to the under-determined system where the number of transmission antennas is larger than that of the receive antennas. The half of the symbols of the transmission matrix are detected by two dependent double-layer sphere decoders, which are referred to as dual double-layer sphere decoding in this paper. The remaining half of the symbols are detected by single-symbol detection, of which complexity is extremely low. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed new detection method improves the detection speed up to ten times depending on the Signalto- Noise Ratio (SNR) compared to the state-of-the-art scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Maximum likelihood decoding","Block codes","Receiving antennas","Diversity methods","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood detection","Error probability","Fading","Chapters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","decoding","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood detection","numerical analysis","orthogonal codes","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood detection scheme","quasi-orthogonal codes","space-time codes","block codes","transmission antennas","receive antennas","transmission matrix","dual double-layer sphere decoding","single-symbol detection","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.070019","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4600165/04600175.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.070019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast ML Detection for Quasi-Orthogonal STBCs of Rate 2 in Under-Determined Systems [Transactions Papers]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast ML Detection for Quasi-Orthogonal STBCs of Rate 2 in Under-Determined Systems [Transactions Papers]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600175/","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600175/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10330938","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast ML Detection for Quasi-Orthogonal STBCs of Rate 2 in Under-Determined Systems [Transactions Papers]","sourcePdf":"tc_0808_1249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068497S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4600165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4600165","articleId":"4600175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4600180,"authors":[{"name":"Steve C.

We investigate transmit power and modulation order adaptation strategies for the IR-HARQ schemes over correlated Rayleigh fading channels using semi-Markov decision process-based model. In order to jointly analyze physical layer and link layer, transmitter model incorporates a finite-size buffer that receives randomly varying traffic from a higher layer application. It is assumed that channel variations can be modeled with a first-order Markov chain. We show that the optimal transmission power and rate adaptation laws under buffering delay and packet overflow constraints can be obtained using the framework of semi-Markov decision process. We discuss three different adaptation models for the IR-HARQ schemes and compare their performances with the non-adaptive scheme. It is shown that unique optimal policy exists for each case and it can be computed using linear programming approach. This optimal policy is then applied for realistic channel fading and incoming traffic samples to evaluate its performance for both hard-decision and soft-decision decoding. Simulation results in general point out that substantial power savings can be achieved using adaptation and also if the transmission-delay requirements are relaxed.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4600165/04600185.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600165","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Rate and Power Adaptation Strategies for IR-HARQ Systems over Fading Channels with Memory: A SMDP-Based Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Rate and Power Adaptation Strategies for IR-HARQ Systems over Fading Channels with Memory: A SMDP-Based Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10330945","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600185/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Rate and Power Adaptation Strategies for IR-HARQ Systems over Fading Channels with Memory: A SMDP-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tc_0808_1352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088188S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4600165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4600165","articleId":"4600185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4600191,"authors":[{"name":"Hani Mehrpouyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hani","lastName":"Mehrpouyan","id":"37397432300"},{"name":"Steven D.

This correspondence presents a numerically stable and accurate method to synthesize ARMA rational approximations of correlated Rayleigh fading processes from more complex higher order representations. Here, the problem is decomposed into autoregressive (AR) model matching followed by linear system identification. Performance is compared to that of AR, inverse discrete Fourier transform, and sum of sinusoids techniques.

In Rayleigh fading channels, this method is mathematically shown to achieve the sum-rate capacity asymptotically with a large number of users, while requiring only a few feedback slots and little transmission power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Multi-user Diversity Gain using User-Identity Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600203.pdf","startPage":"2911","endPage":"2916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Multi-user Diversity Gain using User-Identity Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4600203/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177523","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Multi-user Diversity Gain using User-Identity Feedback","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_2911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08039S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4600204,"authors":[{"name":"Pengcheng Zhu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37402801500"},{"name":"Lan Tang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37288310700"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293648300"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4600204","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Feedback","Diversity methods","Transmitters","Diversity reception","Memoryless systems","Protection","Error analysis","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["index assignment","MIMO systems","quantized beamforming systems","feedback channel","discrete memoryless channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","diversity methods","MIMO systems","finite-rate feedback","index assignment"]}],"abstract":"Index assignment (IA) technique is introduced to quantized beamforming systems.

Both systems exploit temporal variations in the channels so efficiently that depending on the signal-to-noise ratio values, using the estimated channel coefficients they are capable of outperforming the conventional system with perfect channel state information (CSI). In this correspondence, we analyze the relative performance behavior of these two promising fade-resistant CDMA systems.

By forming a virtual antenna array, node cooperation can achieve high antenna and diversity gains by using several partners to relay the transmitted signals. There has been a lot of work on improving the link performance in cooperative networks by using advanced signal processing or power allocation methods among a single source node and its relays. However, the resource allocation among multiple nodes has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present a unified cross- layer framework for resource allocation in cooperative networks, which considers the physical and network layers jointly and can be applied for any cooperative transmission scheme. It is found that the fairness and energy constraint cannot be satisfied simultaneously if each node uses a fixed set of relays. To solve this problem, a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi-state</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cooperation</i>\n methodology is proposed, where the energy is allocated among the nodes state-by-state via a geometric and network decomposition approach. Given the energy allocation, the duration of each state is then optimized so as to maximize the nodes utility. Numerical results will compare the performance of cooperative networks with and without resource allocation for cooperative beamforming and selection relaying. It is shown that without resource allocation, cooperation will result in a poor lifetime of the heavily-used nodes. In contrast, the proposed framework will not only guarantee fairness, but will also provide significant throughput and diversity gain over conventional cooperation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600213.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","startPage":"3000","endPage":"3012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Cross-Layer Framework for Resource Allocation in Cooperative Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Cross-Layer Framework for Resource Allocation in Cooperative Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177485","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600213/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Cross-Layer Framework for Resource Allocation in Cooperative Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155578S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600214,"authors":[{"name":"Ritesh Madan","affiliation":["Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, Inc., NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600214/4600214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ritesh Madan is at Qualcomm-Flarion Technologies, Bridgewater, NJ.

The source broadcasts the data to the relays, some or all of which cooperatively beamform to forward the data to the destination. We generalize the standard approaches for cooperative communications in two key respects: (i) we explicitly model and factor in the cost of acquiring channel state information (CSI), and (ii) we consider more general selection rules for the relays and compute the optimal one among them. In particular, we consider simple relay selection and outage criteria that exploit the inherent diversity of relay networks and satisfy a mandated outage constraint. These criteria include as special cases several relay selection criteria proposed in the literature. We obtain expressions for the total energy consumption for general relay selection and outage criteria for the non-homogeneous case, in which different relay links have different mean channel power gains, and the homogeneous case, in which the relay links statistics are identical. We characterize the structure of the optimal transmission scheme. Numerical results show that the cost of training and feedback of CSI is significant. The optimal strategy is to use a varying subset (and number) of relay nodes to cooperatively beamform at any given time. Depending on the relative location of the relays, the source, and the destination, numerical computations show energy savings of about 16% when an optimal relay selection rule is used. We also study the impact of shadowing correlation on the energy consumption for a cooperative relay network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600214/","volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4600214/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10177486","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Relaying over Fading Channels with Simple Relay Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Relaying over Fading Channels with Simple Relay Selection","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081487S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"269","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4600215,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Dong","affiliation":["Altera Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600215/4600215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaofei Dong received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, Davis in 2006.

We assume that conventional space-time block codes are employed in the underlying source-to-destination (SrarrD), source-to-relay (S rarr R) and relay-to-destination (R rarr D) links, and consider both decode-and-forward (DaF) and amplify - and-forward (AaF) relaying techniques. For the latter one, we consider two variants based on the availability of channel state information (CSI); namely, blind AaF and CSI-assisted AaF. Through the derivation of pairwise error probability, we quantify analytically the impact of multiple antenna deployment for each relaying technique under various scenarios which involve relay location and power control assumptions imposed on cooperating nodes. Our transmission model assumes that the source and destination terminals are equipped with M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</sub>\n transmit and N receive antennas, respectively, and the relay terminal is equipped with M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n receive and M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n transmit antennas.

First we explore antenna selection at the transmitter side based on the received signal to noise ratios. We then study the joint selection of receive and transmit antennas. Both schemes assume a slowly fading channel (i.e., quasi-static fading) and require some limited feedback from the receiver to the transmitter. By computing upper bounds on the pairwise error probabilities and conducting extensive simulations, we show that the space-time coded systems achieve full diversity even with antenna selection provided that the code is full rank. These results are extensions of earlier work on antenna selection for MIMO systems (Bahceci et al., 2003) which only considers receive antenna selection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600218.pdf","startPage":"3056","endPage":"3065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.061087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.061087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Transmit and Receive Antenna Selection over Flat Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Receiving antennas","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Feedback","Upper bound","Pairwise error probability","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit antenna","receive antenna","flat fading channels","antenna selection","space-time coded systems","pairwise error probabilities","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time coding","MIMO communications","antenna selection","transmit/receive antenna selection","spatial diversity","Rayleigh fading channels","pair-wise error probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Transmit and Receive Antenna Selection over Flat Fading Channels","volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4600218/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177490","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Transmit and Receive Antenna Selection over Flat Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3056.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067529S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4600219,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Zhou","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600219/4600219-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhong Zhou (S'06) received B.

In this paper, we propose a novel selective single-relay cooperative scheme, combining selective-relay cooperative communication with physical-layer power control. Based on the MAC-layer RTS-CTS signaling, a set of potential relays compute individually the required transmission power to participate in the cooperative communication, and compete within a window of fixed length. The \"best\" relay is selected in a distributed fashion with minimum signaling overhead. We derive power-control solutions corresponding to two policies on relay selection: one is to minimize the energy consumption per data packet, and the other is to maximize the network lifetime. Our numerical and simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme achieves significant energy savings and prolongs the network lifetime considerably.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.061097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600219.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.061097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","startPage":"3066","endPage":"3078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Communication Based on Power Control and Selective Single-Relay in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Communication Based on Power Control and Selective Single-Relay in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177492","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600219/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Communication Based on Power Control and Selective Single-Relay in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074987S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600222,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600222/4600222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsiao-Chun Wu (M'OO SM'05) received a B.

Very often, multipath fading channels result in the severe AMC performance degradation or induce large classification errors. The negative impacts of multipath fading channels on AMC have been discussed in the existing literature but no solution has ever been proposed so far to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new robust AMC algorithm, which applies higher-order statistics (HOS) in a generic framework for blind channel estimation and pattern recognition. We also derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the fourth-order cumulant estimator when the AMC candidates are BPSK and QPSK over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, and it is a nearly minimum-variance estimator leading to robust AMC features in a wide variety of signal-to-noise ratios. The advantage of our new algorithm is that, by carefully designing the essential features needed for AMC, we do not really have to acquire the complete channel information and therefore it can be feasible without any a priori information in practice. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that our new AMC algorithm can achieve the much better classification accuracy than the existing AMC techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600222.pdf","startPage":"3098","endPage":"3105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Automatic Modulation Classification Using Cumulant Features for Communications via Multipath Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Novel Automatic Modulation Classification Using Cumulant Features for Communications via Multipath Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600222/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177497","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Automatic Modulation Classification Using Cumulant Features for Communications via Multipath Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079744S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4600223,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Tuan Hoang","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600223/4600223-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anh Tuan Hoang (M'07) received the Bachelor degree (with First Class Honours) in telecommunications engineering from the University of Sydney in 2000.

We are interested in the downlink channel/power allocation problem for the cognitive radio network, with the objective of maximizing the total number of active subscribers that can be supported. Here, we assume that each subscriber of the cognitive network can be either active or idle and only active subscribers require downlink transmission. We first consider the case when global knowledge of all active subscribers is available for making control decisions. In that case, a downlink channel/power allocation scheme that maximizes the number of supported subscribers can be obtained by solving a mixed-integer linear programming. We also propose a suboptimal scheme that can be obtained at lower complexity based on a dynamic interference graph. We then consider the case when control decisions can only be made based on local knowledge of active subscribers within each cell. For that, we propose a scalable two-phase channel/power allocation scheme. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070022","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600223.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3106","endPage":"3117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Channel Assignment and Power Control for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Channel Assignment and Power Control for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600223/","volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4600223/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177498","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Channel Assignment and Power Control for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087648S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600224,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio A.

The optimality criterion is the minimization of the mean-square-error (MSE) at the receiver side under a constraint on the overall transmitted power. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are used to assess the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) and minimum achievable MSE. It is shown that non-linear precoding may provide much better results than linear pre-filtering, especially when the number of parallel data streams is close to the number of transmitting and receiving antennas. Compared with other existing methods based on THP, our scheme is different in that the preceded symbols are linearly prefiltered before being launched over the MIMO channel. This results into a power loading operation over the channel eigenmodes, which leads to a remarkable improvement of the error-rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600224.pdf","startPage":"3118","endPage":"3127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Tx-Rx MMSE Design for MIMO Multicarrier Systems with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600224/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Tx-Rx MMSE Design for MIMO Multicarrier Systems with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding","volume":"7","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177499","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600224/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Tx-Rx MMSE Design for MIMO Multicarrier Systems with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112302S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4600226,"authors":[{"name":"Peter J.

In all cases, we evaluate the performance of optimal selection, simple norm-based selection and other benchmark selection techniques. The major contribution is a general approach to analyzing the capacity of the norm-based selection schemes via a simple power scaling factor. We are able to assess the impact of different channels, imperfect CSI and power allocation using this power scaling factor. Furthermore, the analysis is valid for all scenarios: transmit selection, receive selection and joint transmit-receive selection. Results are shown which compare the capacity performance over a wide range of cases. A notable conclusion is that optimal selection, which is computationally intensive, is outperformed at low signal-to-noise- ratios by the simple norm-based approach with power allocation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600226.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3140","endPage":"3149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power Scaling Analysis of Norm-Based Antenna Selection Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Power Scaling Analysis of Norm-Based Antenna Selection Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600226/","volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4600226/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177501","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power Scaling Analysis of Norm-Based Antenna Selection Techniques","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067654S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4600228,"authors":[{"name":"Anders Gjendemsjo","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Anders Gjendemsj\u2298(S'04) received the M.Sc (Sivilingeni\u2298r) and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering, both from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in 2005, and 2007, respectively.

Employing dynamic spectral reuse, we allow for centralized control. In the two-link case, the optimal power allocation then has a remarkably simple nature termed binary power control: depending on the noise and channel gains, assign full power to one link and minimum to the other, or full power on both. Binary power control (BPC) has the advantage of leading towards simpler or even distributed power control algorithms. For N>2 we propose a strategy based on checking the corners of the domain resulting from the power constraints to perform BPC. We identify scenarios in which binary power allocation can be proven optimal also for arbitrary N. Furthermore, in the general setting for N>2, simulations demonstrate that a throughput performance with negligible loss, compared to the best non-binary scheme found by geometric programming, can be obtained by BPC. Finally, to reduce the complexity of optimal binary power allocation for large networks, we provide simple algorithms achieving 99% of the capacity promised by exhaustive binary search.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600228/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177503","volume":"7","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Binary Power Control for Sum Rate Maximization over Multiple Interfering Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Power Control for Sum Rate Maximization over Multiple Interfering Links","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170876S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4600229,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["Research School of Information Science and Engineering, Australian National University, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600229/4600229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Zhao (S'03) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, in 2003 and 2005, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

Mobile radio channels are both time and frequency dispersive, especially at high vehicular speeds, which makes channel estimation a challenging problem in system design. Conventional preamble-based and pilot-aided channel estimation require numerous reference signals, which significantly compromises the system throughput.

The numerical and analytical results show that the proposed technique can approach the performance of systems with perfect CSI with much fewer preamble and pilots symbols compared to existing channel estimation methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600229.pdf","startPage":"3174","endPage":"3184","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Turbo Channel Estimation for OFDM System over Rapid Dispersive Fading Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Turbo Channel Estimation for OFDM System over Rapid Dispersive Fading Channel","volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4600229/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10183449","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Turbo Channel Estimation for OFDM System over Rapid Dispersive Fading Channel","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061404S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4600231,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqi Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600231/4600231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tianqi Wang received the B.E. degree in 2004 in communications engineering, from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, and the M.

The algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method. It can provide accurate estimation of channel state information and synchronization parameter for a DS-CDMA receiver even with a simple equalization module (e.g., an one-tap multiplier based frequency domain equalizer (FDE)), and a radio receiver with this approach performs better than a costly multi-tap multiplier based equalizer, such as the time domain equalizer (TDE). A generic receiver architecture based on the frequency domain equalization for a composite radio, which works in both CDMA and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modes, is also proposed. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed estimator and its optimization scheme are derived. This architecture can be implemented with an iterative approach, and the results demonstrate that this adaptive receiver performs very well with a relatively low cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Expectation-Maximization Algorithm Based Joint Estimation Approach for CDMA/OFDM Composite Radios","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070232","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600231.pdf","startPage":"3196","endPage":"3205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Expectation-Maximization Algorithm Based Joint Estimation Approach for CDMA/OFDM Composite Radios","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4600231/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177506","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Expectation-Maximization Algorithm Based Joint Estimation Approach for CDMA/OFDM Composite Radios","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066377S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4600232,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Vu Nguyen received the Bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering and Telecommunications from the University of Tasmania, Australia in 2003, and the Master degree in Telecommunications from the University of New South Wales, Australia in 2005.

Results show that under the constraint of equal training power and bandwidth efficiency, our optimal design of the superimposed training signal leads to a significant reduction in channel estimation error when compared to the conventional design of time-multiplexing training, especially for slowly time-varying channels with a large coherence time.

A separable correlation model is considered, whereby spatial fading correlation is accounted for at either or at both sides of the collocated MIMO wireless channel. Two extreme scenarios of a double scattering environment are analyzed: (i) an extremely rich scattering environment corresponding to a conventional semi-correlated Rayleigh fading channel and (ii) a double-correlated rank-deficient keyhole channel with a single degree of freedom. In the case of semi-correlated Rayleigh fading, the capacity expressions are derived for two types of correlation structures among the transmitting or the receiving antennas, namely, a constant correlation model and an arbitrary correlation model, the latter being induced by a full-rank Hermitian covariance matrix with non-repeating distinct eigenvalues. On the other hand, the capacity expressions pertaining to the double-correlated keyhole channel are derived given arbitrary Hermitian covariance matrices at the transmitter and the receiver. For all channel types and correlation structures, closed-form expressions for the capacity of the eigen-mode optimal power and rate adaptation policy as well as for the sub-optimal eigen-mode channel inversion and its truncated variant are derived. Monte Carlo simulations are also carried out thereby upholding our theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600233.pdf","startPage":"3218","endPage":"3229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Spatial Fading Correlation and Keyhole on the Capacity of MIMO Systems with Transmitter and Receiver CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600233/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Spatial Fading Correlation and Keyhole on the Capacity of MIMO Systems with Transmitter and Receiver CSI","volume":"7","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177509","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600233/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Spatial Fading Correlation and Keyhole on the Capacity of MIMO Systems with Transmitter and Receiver CSI","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114148S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4600235,"authors":[{"name":"Chong-Yung Chi","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600235/4600235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chong-Yung Chi received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California in 1983.

The algorithm basically comprises:( i) source (path signal) extraction using a hybrid beamforming algorithm composed of a Fourier beamformer and a kurtosis maximization beamformer, (ii) time delay estimation and compensation, (iii) classification (path-to-user association) and blind maximum ratio combining (of path signals). The designed beamformer is exactly the same for all the subcarriers, effectively utilizes multipath diversity for performance gain, and works well even in an environment with spatially correlated sources.

There are two remedies available, namely, (i) channel-dependent ordered decoding at the receiver and (ii) allocation of rates and powers across the transmit antennas. However, the former doesn't improve the D-M tradeoff curve and while the latter does (with maximum diversity gain M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n and maximum multiplexing gain M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n), its tradeoff curve is still significantly inferior compared to the D-M tradeoff curve of the optimum (unconstrained) MIMO architecture. In this two-part paper, it is shown that a dramatically better D-M tradeoff and error (e.g. outage) probability can be obtained if the two remedies, i.e., ordered BLAST decoding and rate/power allocation, are judiciously combined. Indeed, a framework is developed for jointly designing channel-dependent ordered decoding at the receiver and decoding order-dependent rate/power allocation at the transmitter. The framework encompasses a large class of new spatial multiplexing architectures (SMAs). In this part, an upper bound to the D-M tradeoff for this class is obtained and found to be quite close to the optimal D-M tradeoff of the MIMO channel. Two special SMAs are proposed corresponding to two different decoding orderings. One is called the norm ordering rate tailored SMA (NRT-SMA), and the other is called the greedy ordering rate tailored SMA (GRT-SMA). The latter is shown to have the D-M tradeoff equal to the upper bound and is hence optimal in D-M tradeoff among the proposed class of SMAs. Compared to the traditional V-BLAST architecture, the only added complexity of these SMAs is due to (i) feeding back the decoding order information (leslog\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n!) bits) per channel realization, and (ii) applying rate and power allocation according to a pre-computed lookup table.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600236.pdf","startPage":"3252","endPage":"3261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing Architectures with Jointly Designed Rate-Tailoring and Ordered BLAST Decoding - Part I: Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600236/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing Architectures with Jointly Designed Rate-Tailoring and Ordered BLAST Decoding - Part I: Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff Analysis","volume":"7","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177536","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600236/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Multiplexing Architectures with Jointly Designed Rate-Tailoring and Ordered BLAST Decoding - Part I: Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff Analysis","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102512S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600237,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Jiang","affiliation":["Nextwave Wireless, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4600188/4600237/4600237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Jiang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2001.

As introduced in part I of this paper, the SMAs consist of joint design of rate and power allocation to the spatially-multiplexed substreams at the transmitter and ordered nulling/canceling detection/decoding at the receiver. This was studied in part I under the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff framework. Here the more detailed and practical problem of allocating rates and powers across the transmit antennas is investigated to minimize the overall system (uncoded or outage) error probability. Since the layer gains are unavailable to the transmitter, the rates and powers must be allocated based on the statistics of the layer gains. However, the channel dependent ordering rules make the precise distributions of the layer gains complicated or intractable. To solve this problem, a simple, yet effective, four-parameter hyperbola model is proposed to closely approximate the error probability of each layer. With this approximation, the computation of rate and power allocation according to the criterion of minimizing the maximal error probability of all the substreams is given. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed SMAs, especially that of the greedy ordering rate tailored SMA (GRT-SMA). Although the rate and power allocation method is obtained under the assumption of iid Rayleigh fading channel, the proposed SMAs also work well in other types of fading channels (such as in correlated and Rician channels).","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.070445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4600188/04600237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.070445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600188","startPage":"3626","endPage":"3271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing Architectures with Jointly Designed Rate-Tailoring and Ordered BLAST Decoding Part-II: A Practical Method for Rate and Power Allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing Architectures with Jointly Designed Rate-Tailoring and Ordered BLAST Decoding Part-II: A Practical Method for Rate and Power Allocation","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177537","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Multiplexing Architectures with Jointly Designed Rate-Tailoring and Ordered BLAST Decoding Part-II: A Practical Method for Rate and Power Allocation","sourcePdf":"tw_0808_3262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068467S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4600188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4600188","articleId":"4600237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600240,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The major sources of performance degradation have been identified as the spatial, angular, and temporal spread of the propagating beam when the propagation channel is multiscattering, resulting in reduced power reception and inter signal interference, as well as turbulence-induced scintillations and noise due to receiver circuitry and background illumination. In this paper performance analysis is carried out for an optical wireless link in the presence of atmospheric scintillation using OOK and M-ary PPM modulation schemes. Then a theoretical analysis of coherence interference in optical wireless communication through scattering channels is carried out for a fixed a scintillation variance and try to quantify the resultant performance degradation due to multiscattering channel. We conclude that for both atmospheric scintillation and multiscattering effect higher order PPM offers better performance than OOK.","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2007.4600240","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on High Capacity Optical Networks and Enabling Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on High Capacity Optical Networks and Enabling Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588288/4600238/04600240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2007.4600240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600238","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of M-ary pulse position modulation and on off keying in a direct detection optical wireless communication system in the presence of atmospheric effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of M-ary pulse position modulation and on off keying in a direct detection optical wireless communication system in the presence of atmospheric effects","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10146188","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of M-ary pulse position modulation and on off keying in a direct detection optical wireless communication system in the presence of atmospheric effects","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110408S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4588288","isNumber":"4600238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588288","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4600238","articleId":"4600240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600245,"authors":[{"name":"Sana Javed","affiliation":["EE Department, NUST Institute of Information and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sana","lastName":"Javed","id":"37703483200"},{"name":"Imtiaz Ahmad Khokhar","affiliation":["EE Department, NUST Institute of Information and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Imtiaz Ahmad","lastName":"Khokhar","id":"37294461400"},{"name":"Atiya Obaid","affiliation":["EE Department, NUST Institute of Information and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Atiya","lastName":"Obaid","id":"37700455300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1828-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1829-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-4092"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-4106"}],"articleNumber":"4600245","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Receivers","Detection algorithms","Transmitters","Encoding","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","deterministic algorithms","iterative methods","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip-by-chip iterative detection","interleave-division multiple access","elementary signal estimator","IDMA systems","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","IDMA","MUD","Elementary Signal Estimator (ESE)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600245","abstract":"This paper adopts a deterministic approach to propose a modified elementary signal estimator (ESE) for chip by chip iterative multi-user detection (MUD) in IDMA systems.

When many optical amplifiers are employed in multi-repeater transoceanic systems, the pump is intensity modulated to obtain information about the health of the repeaters. Gain modulation dynamics referring to dynamics of pump modulation transferred to the signal is studied to help make a reasonable choice of pump wavelength for modulation and to provide power compensation if necessary from the resulting power penalty. In this paper, we study using numerical modeling, the effect of time division multiplexed pumping on the gain modulation dynamics in a WDM system. It is found that modulation transfer response is flatter and stronger across the WDM channels when the Raman amplifier pumps are time division multiplexed.

To reduce power consumption, the LED is pulsed and thus the input to the TIA is a modulated current pulse.

The main goal of these analyses is to enable a detection of seizure precursors. Several methods based on CNN - e.g. the approximation of the correlation dimension, the prediction of EEG-signals, the pattern detection algorithm - have been proposed and studied in detail. Yielding interesting results, the signal prediction algorithm has been analyzed in more detail in order to optimize the obtained results of the predictor system, both for quality and computational complexity. Applying a CNN predictor to recordings of multi EEG electrodes results in a so called prediction error profile. Electrodes which show the most significant changes before epileptic seizures could be identified by using these profiles.","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2006.4600299","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591408/4600290/04600299.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2006.4600299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG analysis by multi layer Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNN)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"EEG analysis by multi layer Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNN)","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600299/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10146263","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG analysis by multi layer Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNN)","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"A1L-B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154578S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4591408","isNumber":"4600290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591408","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4600290","articleId":"4600299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4600301,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Chern Chiou","affiliation":["Brain Research Center, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Chern Chiou","id":"37288068400"},{"name":"Li-Wei Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao-Tong University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, China"],"lastName":"Li-Wei Ko","id":"37274528300"},{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao-Tong University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, China"],"lastName":"Chin-Teng Lin","id":"37278412100"},{"name":"Chao-Ting Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao-Tong University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, China"],"lastName":"Chao-Ting Hong","id":"37928257800"},{"name":"Tzyy-Ping Jung","affiliation":["Institute of Neural Computation, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tzyy-Ping Jung","id":"37347416700"},{"name":"Sheng-Fu Liang","affiliation":["Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-Fu Liang","id":"37272837900"},{"name":"Jong-Liang Jeng","affiliation":["Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jong-Liang Jeng","id":"38558434900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0436-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0437-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"4600301","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Electroencephalography","Skin","Probes","Brain modeling","Etching","Brain models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","electroencephalography","microsensors","sleep"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEMS EEG sensors","drowsiness application","electroencephalographic analysis","sleep","microelectromechanical systems","MEM silicon spiked electrode array","conductive paste","scalp preparation","isotropic-anisotropic reactive ion etching","inductive coupled plasma micromachining","stratum corneum","skin","electrode-skin interface impedance","dry-electrode array","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Drowsiness Estimation","Dry Electrode","Electroencephalogram","Micro-electro-mechanical Systems","Principle Component Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600301","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2006.4600301","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","abstract":"Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis has been widely adopted for the monitoring of cognitive state changes and sleep stages because abundant information in EEG recording reflects changes in drowsiness, arousal, sleep, and attention, etc. In this study, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based silicon spiked electrode array, namely dry electrodes, are fabricated and characterized to bring EEG monitoring to the operational workplaces without requiring conductive paste or scalp preparation. An isotropic/anisotropic reactive ion etching with inductive coupled plasma (RIE-ICP) micromachining fabrication process was developed to manufacture the needle-like micro probes to pierce the stratum corneum of skin and obtain superior electrically conducting characteristics. This article reports a series of prosperity testing and evaluations of continuous EEG recordings. Our results suggest that the dry electrodes have advantages in electrode-skin interface impedance, signal intensity and size over the conventional (wet) electrodes. In addition, we also developed an EEG-based drowsiness estimation system that consists of the dry-electrode array, power spectrum estimation, principal component analysis (PCA)-based EEG signal analysis, and multivariate linear regression to estimate driverpsilas drowsiness level in a virtual-reality-based dynamic driving simulator to demonstrate the potential applications of the MEMS electrodes in operational environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2006.4600301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600290","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591408/4600290/04600301.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using novel MEMS EEG sensors in detecting drowsiness application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4600301/","displayDocTitle":"Using novel MEMS EEG sensors in detecting drowsiness application","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10146293","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using novel MEMS EEG sensors in detecting drowsiness application","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"A1L-B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066015S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4591408","isNumber":"4600290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591408","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4600290","articleId":"4600301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4600317,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Yuan Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jui-Yuan Yu","id":"37404161100"},{"name":"Wan-Chun Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wan-Chun Liao","id":"37554030300"},{"name":"Chen-Yi Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Yi Lee","id":"37280413800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0436-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0437-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"4600317","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"abstract":"This paper presents a multi-tone CDMA (MT-CDMA) based system specification for wireless body area network (WBAN) applications.

The design consists of a low-noise variable gain amplifier as the first stage, a low-Gm high-pass filter as the second stage, and a low-pass Gm-C amplifier as the last stage. Discrete-time autozeroing is utilized to reduce the offset and noise. The bandwidth and autozeroing frequency of the amplifier is optimized to reduce noise folding. A current division technique is utilized to achieve a low-Gm OTA (Operational Transconductance Amplifier) so that low frequency operation is realized without any external capacitors. All the input pair transistors are biased in sub-threshold operation to reduce power consumption. A cross-couple parallel pair of source degeneration transistors is employed to increase the linearity crucial to neural spike detection. This design achieves variable gain from 470 (55dB) to 1.

To address these problems, a new class of miniature, ultra low noise, capacitive sensor that does not require direct contact to the skin, and has comparable performance to gold standard ECG electrodes, has been developed.

The DCB approach relies on a set of terms for parsing and segmenting input texts. Whereas the MLB approach relies on a model trained from a corpus by using machine learning techniques. We compare between two algorithms from the DCB approach: longest-matching and maximal matching, and four algorithms from the MLB approach: Naive Bayes (NB), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and conditional random field (CRF). From the experimental results, the DCB approach yielded better performance than the NB, decision tree and SVM algorithms from the MLB approach.

Based on channel information, a receiver selects a transmit beamforming vector, which contains transmit antenna gains, from a vector set or codebook. The codebook index for the selected beamforming vector that maximizes channel capacity is relayed to the transmitter via a rate-limited feedback channel. Previously, we have proposed a random vector quantization (RVQ) codebook, which consists of independent isotropically distributed vectors and showed that it performs close to the optimal codebook. However, RVQ requires exhaustive search to locate the desired beamformer. To lessen the search complexity, we propose a tree-structured (TS) RVQ. Numerical results show that number of computations required for TS-RVQ search can be orders of magnitude fewer than that required for RVQ search for given performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600438/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"10146088","publicationDate":"May 2008","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600438/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tree-structured Random Vector Quantization for beamforming in a multiantenna channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-structured Random Vector Quantization for beamforming in a multiantenna channel","confLoc":"Krabi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"vol 1_81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052624S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586412","isNumber":"4600357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4600357","articleId":"4600438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4600439,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In particular, there have been several recent research studies suggesting that encryption could noticeably degrade performance of WLAN systems by as much as 20%. Since the 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum used in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN systems is unlicensed and shared by various kinds of wireless devices and appliances, the high interference in this frequency band may affect the experiment results. Hence, it is worthwhile to reinvestigate and verify whether encryption in WLANs actually introduces that much performance degradation. In essence, encryption should only have minimal impact on performance because the amount of overhead inserted by the encryption algorithms is normally less than 1% of the total payload. In this work, we reinvestigate the issue of the impact of encryption on the throughput performance of WLANs. We present the analysis and experiment results to demonstrate that encryption actually has negligible impact on the throughput performance of a WLAN system regardless of the MAC payload size the system uses, regardless of whether the system uses UDP or TCP, and regardless of whether the system operates in the infrastructure topology or the peer-to-peer topology.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586412/4600357/04600451.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600357","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting the impact of encryption on performance of IEEE 802.11 WLAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Throughput","Wireless LAN","Wireless communication","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Payloads","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cryptography","IEEE standards","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 WLAN","system performance","wireless signal encryption","frequency spectrum","performance degradation","MAC payload size","frequency 2.4 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting the impact of encryption on performance of IEEE 802.11 WLAN","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4600451/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10146101","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting the impact of encryption on performance of IEEE 802.11 WLAN","confLoc":"Krabi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"vol 1_94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051944S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586412","isNumber":"4600357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586412","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4600357","articleId":"4600451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600453,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This technique is used in a system based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM has many orthogonally modulated subcarriers which unexpectedly produce a peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and tend to reduce the power efficiency of a RF amplifier. A sequence of input data is rearranged by SLM for the reduction of PAPR and then fed into the APPR process in the proposed system. The APPR method controls the peak levels of the modulation signal by an adaptive algorithm. It reduces modulation signals over a predefined range. In simulation results, the proposed method has shown better PAPR reduction compared to the SLM and the APPR.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600453","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586412/4600357/04600453.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction in OFDM systems using SLM cascade with APPR methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600453/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction in OFDM systems using SLM cascade with APPR methods","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10146103","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600453/","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction in OFDM systems using SLM cascade with APPR methods","confLoc":"Krabi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"vol 1_96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040932S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586412","isNumber":"4600357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4600357","articleId":"4600453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600456,"authors":[{"name":"Pisit Boonsrimuang","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, King Mongkuts Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pisit","lastName":"Boonsrimuang","id":"37327400700"},{"name":"Pornpawit Boonsrimuang","affiliation":["Faculty of Industrial Technology, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pornpawit","lastName":"Boonsrimuang","id":"38232081900"},{"name":"Tawil Paungma","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, King Mongkuts Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tawil","lastName":"Paungma","id":"37327400000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2101-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4600456","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Partial transmit sequences","Time domain analysis","Modulation","Equations","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial transmit sequence method","OFDM signal","multipath fading channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","weighting factor","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"The major drawback of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a large Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). To overcome the PAPR problem, many PAPR reduction methods have been proposed. Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) method is a well known method to reduce the PAPR statistics of an OFDM signal. The PTS method can reduce the PAPR by controlling the multiplied weighting factor of subblock both data sub carrier and clusters. The PTS method can improve PAPR reduction performance very well as increasing a number of weighting factors and clusters. However, the number of side information is proportionally increasing as increased number of weighting factors or/and clutters, which are required to inform the side information to the receiver for recovering the original data. In this paper, we propose the new weighting factor which can improve the PAPR reduction performance better than conventional PTS method. The proposed method doesnpsilat have any additional number of side information and system complexity. The proposed method can achieve both a better PAPR performance and BER performance with keeping the same number of side information when compare with the conventional PTS method. This paper presents various computer simulation results to verify the effectiveness of proposed method in the multi-path fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600456","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586412/4600357/04600456.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposal of improved PTS method for OFDM signal in the multi-path fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600456/","displayDocTitle":"Proposal of improved PTS method for OFDM signal in the multi-path fading channel","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10146145","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600456/","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal of improved PTS method for OFDM signal in the multi-path fading channel","confLoc":"Krabi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"vol 1_99.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130965S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586412","isNumber":"4600357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4600357","articleId":"4600456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600457,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While many such algorithms have been proposed, the almost SRR estimations are based on L1 or L2 statistical norm estimation. Hence, these algorithms are usually too sensitive to their assumed noise model limiting their application. In this paper, we propose a novel SRR framework using the stochastic regularization technique by minimizing a cost function. The Hampel norm is used for measuring the difference between the projected estimate of the high quality image and each low high quality image and for removing outliers in the data. To remove artifacts from the final answer and improve the rate of convergence, Tikhonov regularization is incorporated in the proposed framework. Finally, a number of experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to several previously published methods using a several noise models such as noiseless, AWGN, Poisson noise and Salt & Pepper noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600473","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586412/4600357/04600473.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"476","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust iterative multiframe SRR using stochastic regularization technique based on hampel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A robust iterative multiframe SRR using stochastic regularization technique based on hampel estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4600473/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10146162","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust iterative multiframe SRR using stochastic regularization technique based on hampel estimation","confLoc":"Krabi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"vol 1_116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040778S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586412","isNumber":"4600357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4600357","articleId":"4600473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4600496,"authors":[{"name":"Peerapol Yuvapoositanon","affiliation":["Centre of Electronic System Design and Signal Processing, Department of Electronic Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Peerapol","lastName":"Yuvapoositanon","id":"37281513500"},{"name":"Sutat Suwannajan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sutat","lastName":"Suwannajan","id":"37567814800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2101-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4600496","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"abstract":"A blind adaptive step-size time-domain receiver for multi-carrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems is presented.

in reverse link for mobile DS/CDMA systems using support vector regression","abstract":"This paper presents an application of the support vector regression (SVR) in prediction of received signal power in the direct sequence code division multiple access (DS/CDMA) systems. The predictor selects the parameters by using five-fold cross-validation method. The results are evaluated in term of minimum mean square error (MMSE.) The inputs for the predictor are the past values of signal series and the output is the next step ahead value. The SVR-based predictor is compared to the previously proposed linear and nonlinear neural network-based predictors, i.e., the adaptive linear (Adaline) predictors and the multilayer perceptrons (MLP), respectively. A noisy Rayleigh fading channel with 1.8 GHz carrier frequency in an urban environment is simulated as the wireless channel. The results show that the SVR-based predictor can estimate the power better than the Adaline and MLP predictors by considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600497/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10146186","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4600497/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power prediction in reverse link for mobile DS/CDMA systems using support vector regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power prediction in reverse link for mobile DS/CDMA systems using support vector regression","confLoc":"Krabi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"vol 1_140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03976S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586412","isNumber":"4600357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4600357","articleId":"4600497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600522,"authors":[{"name":"Rujisak Muangsong","affiliation":["Department of Control System and Instrumentation Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Rujisak","lastName":"Muangsong","id":"37687842400"},{"name":"Diew Koolpiruck","affiliation":["Department of Control System and Instrumentation Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Diew","lastName":"Koolpiruck","id":"37267772600"},{"name":"Anak Khantachawana","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Anak","lastName":"Khantachawana","id":"37687841600"},{"name":"Panadda Niranatlumpong","affiliation":["114 Thailand Science Park Paholyothin Rd., Klong 1, Klong Luang, Pathumthani 12120 Thailand"],"firstName":"Panadda","lastName":"Niranatlumpong","id":"37687841300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2101-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4600522","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Springs","Temperature","Shape","Actuators","Position control","Shape memory alloys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","alloys","control system synthesis","mathematical analysis","optimisation","position control","shape memory effects","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","optimal design","PID controller","position control","shape memory alloys actuator","PSO","SMA","mathematical model","integrated absolute error condition","IAE"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600522","abstract":"This paper presents the optimal design of PID controller based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach for position control using spring shape memory alloys (SMA) actuator.

The generation outputs for UC-SCOPF are the outputs at normal operating state that ensure the system security when contingency occurs.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600574","startPage":"893","endPage":"896","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600498","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586412/4600498/04600574.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unit commitment considering security-constrained optimal power flow by lagrangian relaxation with genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600574/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unit commitment considering security-constrained optimal power flow by lagrangian relaxation with genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4600574/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10221075","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unit commitment considering security-constrained optimal power flow by lagrangian relaxation with genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Krabi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"vol2_216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073865S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586412","isNumber":"4600498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4600498","articleId":"4600574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4600651,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Huber","affiliation":["Center of Sensorimotor Research, Department of Neurology, Ludwig-Maximilians Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Huber","id":"37666138500"},{"name":"Markus Rickert","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rickert","id":"37681876600"},{"name":"Alois Knoll","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Knoll","id":"37276234100"},{"name":"Thomas Brandt","affiliation":["Department of Neurology, Ludwig-Maximilians Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brandt","id":"37411082900"},{"name":"Stefan Glasauer","affiliation":["Center of Sensorimotor Research, Department of Neurology, Ludwig-Maximilians Universitat Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Glasauer","id":"38504563000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2212-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2213-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"4600651","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1752},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600651","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end effectors","man-machine systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","human-human hand-over interaction","trapezoidal velocity profile","minimum-jerk profile","end-effector"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2008.4600651","endPage":"112","startPage":"107","publicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2008 - The 17th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2008 - The 17th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591422/4600621/04600651.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2008.4600651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-robot interaction in handing-over tasks","abstract":"In many future joint-action scenarios, humans and robots will have to interact physically in order to successfully cooperate. Ideally, seamless human-robot interaction should not require training for the human, but should be intuitively simple. Nonetheless, seamless interaction and cooperation involve some degree of learning and adaptation. Here, we report on a simple case of physical human-robot interaction, a hand-over task. Even such a basic task as manually handing over an object from one agent to another requires that both partners agree upon certain basic prerequisites and boundary conditions. While some of them are negotiated explicitly, e.g. by verbal communication, others are determined indirectly and adaptively in the course of the cooperation. In the present study, we compared human-human hand-over interaction with the same task done by a robot and a human. To evaluate the importance of biological motion, the robot human interaction was tested with two different velocity profiles: a conventional trapezoidal velocity profile in joint coordinates and a minimum-jerk profile of the end-effector. Our results show a significantly shorter reaction time for minimum jerk profiles, which decreased over the first three hand-overs. The results of our comparison provide the background for implementing effective joint-action strategies in humanoid robot systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4600651/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4600651/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10174349","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Human-robot interaction in handing-over tasks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-robot interaction in handing-over tasks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"029_SaP3T1-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048718S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4591422","isNumber":"4600621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591422","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"4600621","articleId":"4600651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4600655,"authors":[{"name":"Claus Lenz","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Lenz","id":"37547855300"},{"name":"Suraj Nair","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Suraj","lastName":"Nair","id":"37570908800"},{"name":"Markus Rickert","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rickert","id":"37681876600"},{"name":"Alois Knoll","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Knoll","id":"37276234100"},{"name":"Wolgang Rosel","affiliation":["Machine Tools and Industrial Management, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolgang","lastName":"Rosel","id":"37688018400"},{"name":"Jurgen Gast","affiliation":["Human Machine Communication, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Gast","id":"37403644000"},{"name":"Alexander Bannat","affiliation":["Human Machine Communication, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Bannat","id":"37397421600"},{"name":"Frank Wallhoff","affiliation":["Human Machine Communication, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Wallhoff","id":"37266136600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2212-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2213-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"4600655","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial manipulators","robotic assembly","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint-action","humans","industrial robots","assembly tasks","smart working environment","sensor modalities","industrial robot manipulator","knowledge databases","decision processes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4600655","abstract":"This paper presents a concept of a smart working environment designed to allow true joint-actions of humans and industrial robots.

It is primarily composed of linear operations that are easily implemented in hardware and there is no iteration for any explicit coarse-to-fine control strategy. These properties make the real time flow of data possible through the hardware. We show that the elapsed time per frame is reduced by applying the proposed algorithm.

To solve this design challenge, this work presents a multi-radix FFT using Pipeline in Memory-based Architecture (PIMA). The proposed PIMA FFT processor combines both the merits of pipeline architectures and those of memory-based architectures.

The third scheme is new, and it is inspired by rate-distortion theory of Gaussian correlated sources. For each scheme we derive the conditions under which the system achieves full multiplexing gain. The first two schemes are direct extensions of previously proposed schemes to the OFDM case. The key difference with respect to the widely treated frequency-flat case is that in MIMO-OFDM the ldquofrequency-domainrdquo channel is a Gaussian correlated source. The new ldquotime-domainrdquo quantization scheme takes advantage of the channel frequency correlation structure and outperforms the other schemes. Furthermore, it is by far simpler to implement than complicated spherical vector quantization. In particular, we observe that no structured codebook design and vector quantization is actually needed for efficient channel state information feedback.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601019.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback schemes for multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Time domain analysis","Antennas","Vector quantization","Rate-distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink","broadcast channel","analog feedback","direction quantized feedback","time-domain channel quantized feedback","Gaussian correlated sources","spherical vector quantization","channel state information feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Feedback schemes for multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601019/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152437","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback schemes for multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Caire.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099662S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601023,"authors":[{"name":"He Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"He Huang","id":"37691686000"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2670-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4601023","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Uncertainty","Array signal processing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","automatic repeat request","channel capacity","channel coding","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","statistical analysis","transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic capacity","multiple-input multiple-output system","automatic repeat request","MIMO ARQ linear precoder design","channel statistic information","beamforming technique","wireless communication system","transceiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","ARQ","precoding","ergodic capacity"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, there has been broad research interest in the development of beamforming and precoding techniques for MIMO wireless communication systems.

The method is conceptually simple, but when the dimensionality of the constraint nodes (number of their code-words) grows, it becomes difficult to handle the computational complexity, which rise while evaluating these enumerators. To deal with this difficulty, we posed a conjecture, which greatly reduce the computational complexity. Trails to proof this conjecture showed that the proof is a challenging problem. Also, proving it will strengthen the theory of enumerating protograph-based G-LDPC code ensembles. Which in turn helps in predicating the average performances for codes drawn from these ensembles.

The number of iterations the decoder spends on a given frame determines both the probability of successful decoding, and the time expended. But whereas the speed of an LDPC decoder without a buffer is determined by its most difficult frames, the speed of a variable-iterations decoder with sufficient buffering approaches that determined by frames of average difficulty. It is relatively straightforward to analyze this as a D/G/1 queuing problem combined with empirically measured probability distributions of iteration counts for specific LDPC codes. Our analysis parallels that of other researchers, e.g., (J. Vogt and A. Finger, 2001), (G. Bosco et al., 2005), (M. Rovini and A. Martinez, 2007), and examines the resulting implications on LDPC decoder design choices. We find that a buffer large enough to hold only B = 2 or 3 additional frames is sufficient to achieve near optimal performance. We prove a strong monotonicity condition: not only does a variable-iterations decoder with buffer size B +1 frames outperform one with buffer size B in terms of average error rate, every single frame is guaranteed to receive at least as many iterations from the decoder with the larger buffer, if needed. Significantly, at low error rates, a variable-iterations decoder with buffer size B can keep pace with an input data rate B +1 times faster than a fixed-iterations decoder with the same processing speed.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601025","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601025.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffering requirements for variable-iterations LDPC decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601025","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Buffering requirements for variable-iterations LDPC decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601025/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10152443","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601025/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffering requirements for variable-iterations LDPC decoders","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Dolinar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075443S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4601028,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Fagnani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Fagnani","id":"37270336400"},{"name":"Chiara Ravazzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Ravazzi","id":"37546563600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2670-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4601028","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601028","abstract":"In this paper we consider ensembles of codes, denoted RA\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n, obtained by a serial concatenation of a repetition code and m accumulate codes through uniform random inter-leavers.

Instead of the commonly used total power constraint on relays and the transmitter, we use a more practical assumption that every node in the network has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol with beamforming is used, in which the transmitter and relays are allowed to adaptively adjust their transmit power and directions according to available channel information. The optimal beamforming problem is solved analytically. The complexity of finding the exact solution is linear in the number of relays. Our results show that the transmitter should always use its maximal power and the optimal power used at a relay is not a binary function. It can take any value between zero and its maximum transmit power. Also, interestingly, this value depends on the quality of all other channels in addition to the relaypsilas own ones. Despite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with the aid of a low-rate broadcast from the receiver, a relay needs only its own channel information to implement the optimal power control. Simulated performance shows that network beamforming achieves full diversity and outperforms other existing schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601040.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming in wireless relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Power control","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio receivers","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless relay networks","optimal beamforming","receiver","transmitter","amplify-and-forward protocol","channel information","distributive strategy","low-rate broadcast","optimal power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay network","beamforming","cooperative diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming in wireless relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152457","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming in wireless relay networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Jafarkhani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075926S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601042,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Cui","id":"37277084800"},{"name":"Tracey Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tracey Ho","id":"37272859700"},{"name":"Jorg Kliewer","affiliation":["Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Kliewer","id":"37271357600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2670-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4601042","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Error probability","Channel estimation","Channel coding","Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memoryless systems","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memoryless two-way relay channels","relaying strategies","received signal","binary antipodal signaling","terminal-relay channels","nonabs-based strategies"]}],"abstract":"We consider relaying strategies for memoryless two-way relay channels, where the signal transmitted by a relay depends only on its previously received signal. For binary antipodal signaling under the general case of different SNRs on the terminal-relay channels, we consider two classes of relay strategies: abs-based strategies in which the processing at the relay is solely based on the absolute value of the received signal, and non-abs-based strategies. We analyze and optimize the performance of existing and new schemes for two-way relay channels under an average power constraint, including abs-based and non-abs-based versions of amplify and forward (AF), decode and forward (DF), and estimate and forward (EF). Additionally, we optimize the relay function via functional analysis such that the average probability of error is minimized in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

The investigation begins with presentation of four algebraic constructions of RS-based non-binary quasi-cyclic (QC)-LDPC codes. Then, the performances of some codes constructed based on the proposed methods with iterative decoding are compared with those of RS codes of the same lengths and rates decoded with the hard-decision Berlekamp-Massey (BM)-algorithm and the algebraic soft-decision Kotter-Vardy (KV)-algorithm over both the AWGN and a Rayleigh fading channels. Comparison shows that the constructed non-binary QC-LDPC codes significantly outperform their corresponding RS codes decoded with either the BM-algorithm or the KV-algorithm. Most impressively, the orders of decoding computational complexity of the constructed non-binary QC-LDPC codes decoded with 5 and 50 iterations of a Fast Fourier Transform based sum-product algorithm are much smaller than those of their corresponding RS codes decoded with the KV-algorithm, while achieve 1:5 to 3 dB coding gains. The comparison shows that well designed non-binary LDPC codes have a great potential to replace RS codes for some applications in communication or storage systems, at least before a very efficient algorithm for decoding RS codes is devised.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601044","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601044.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-binary LDPC codes vs. Reed-Solomon codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601044","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-binary LDPC codes vs. Reed-Solomon codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601044/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10152461","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601044/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-binary LDPC codes vs. Reed-Solomon codes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11208S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4601046,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

A key challenge now is to parlay these breakthroughs into innovative system concepts. We review three such concepts here.Millimeter wave MIMO: The small carrier wavelength enables spatial multiplexing in line-of-sight environments, potentially resulting in point-to-point outdoor wireless links at optical speeds (40 Gbps) using bandwidths of the order of 5 GHz. Directional multihop networking: Indoor Gigabit wireless links based on 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum are subject to disruption due to line-of-sight blockage by obstacles such as furniture and humans. We show that a multihop architecture with a small number of relays assures full network connectivity. All-digital multiGigabit baseband: Since high-speed analog-to- digital conversion (ADC) is costly and power-hungry, in order to design all-digital baseband processing that can be implemented inexpensively by riding Moore's law, we must be able to perform signal processing with sloppy ADC.

consider the problem of rate allocation in a fading Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) with fixed transmission powers. Our goal is to maximize a general concave utility function of transmission rates over the throughput capacity region. In contrast to earlier works in this context that propose solutions where a potentially complex optimization problem must be solved in every decision instant, we propose a low-complexity approximate rate allocation policy and analyze the effect of temporal channel variations on its utility performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the tracking capabilities of an approximate rate allocation scheme under fading channel conditions. We build on an earlier work to present a new rate allocation policy for a fading MAC that implements a low-complexity approximate gradient projection iteration for each channel measurement, and explicitly characterize the effect of the speed of temporal channel variations on the tracking neighborhood of our policy. We further improve our results by proposing an alternative rate allocation policy for which tighter bounds on the size of the tracking neighborhood are derived. These proposed rate allocation policies are computationally efficient in our setting since they implement a single gradient projection iteration per channel measurement and each such iteration relies on approximate projections which has polynomial-complexity in the number of users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4601054/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152471","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic rate allocation in fading multiple access channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic rate allocation in fading multiple access channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Parandehgheibi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065968S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4601055,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538714000"},{"name":"Henry D.

In this paper, we analyze CS using tools from coding theory because CS can also be viewed as syndrome-based source coding of sparse vectors using linear codes over real numbers. While coding theory does not typically deal with codes over real numbers, there is actually a very close relationship between CS and error-correcting codes over large discrete alphabets. This connection leads naturally to new reconstruction methods and analysis. In some cases, the resulting methods provably require many fewer measurements than previous approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601055","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601055.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","startPage":"558","endPage":"561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing and linear codes over real numbers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601055","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing and linear codes over real numbers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601055/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152472","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4601055/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing and linear codes over real numbers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Pfister.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098328S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601062,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Yang Han","id":"37406876900"},{"name":"William E.

The error floor has been attributed to certain subgraphs of an LDPC codepsilas Tanner graph induced by so-called trapping sets. We show in this paper that once we identify the trapping sets of an LDPC code of interest, a sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder can be custom-designed to yield floors that are orders of magnitude lower than the conventional SPA decoder. We present three classes of such decoders: (1) a bi-mode decoder, (2) a bit-pinning decoder which utilizes one or more outer algebraic codes, and (3) three generalized-LDPC decoders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these decoders for two codes, the rate-1/2 (2640,1320) Margulis code which is notorious for its floors and a rate-0.3 (640,192) quasi-cyclic code which has been devised for this study. Although the paper focuses on these two codes, the decoder design techniques presented are fully generalizable to any LDPC code.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601062","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601062.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC decoder strategies for achieving low error floors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601062","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"LDPC decoder strategies for achieving low error floors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601062/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10152479","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601062/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC decoder strategies for achieving low error floors","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Ryan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137583S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4601064,"authors":[{"name":"Anant Sahai","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769200"},{"name":"Pulkit Grover","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pulkit","lastName":"Grover","id":"37398027100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2670-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4601064","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The price of certainty: iterative decoding from a total power perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Complexity theory","Encoding","AWGN channels","Channel coding","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","digital communication","error statistics","iterative decoding","radio links","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","certainty price","total power perspective","point-to-point digital communication","communication channel","power consumption","ASIC-oriented model","sparse graph codes","bit error probability"]}],"abstract":"The classical problem of reliable point-to-point digital communication is to achieve a low probability of error while keeping the rate high and the power consumption small. Traditionally, explicit power-dependent (idealized) models for the communication channel are used to study the transmit power required. The resulting dasiawaterfallpsila curves convey the revolutionary idea that unboundedly low probabilities of bit-error are attainable using only finite transmit power. However, it has long been observed that the decoder complexity, and hence the total power consumption, goes up when attempting to use codes that operate close to the waterfall curve. This paper explores this theme by using explicit models for computation and power consumption at the decoder. To get a lower bound, an ASIC-oriented model is given that allows for extreme parallelism in implementation. The decoder architecture is in the spirit of iterative decoding for sparse-graph codes, but is further idealized in that it allows for more computational power than is currently known to be implementable. Generalized sphere-packing arguments are used to derive bounds on the number of decoding iterations needed for any possible code given only the rate and the desired probability of error. The lower bound is plotted to show an unavoidable tradeoff between the average bit-error probability and the total power used in transmission and decoding. In the spirit of conventional waterfall curves, we call these ldquowatersliderdquo curves.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601064","startPage":"293","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601064.pdf","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601064","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601064/","displayDocTitle":"The price of certainty: iterative decoding from a total power perspective","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4601064/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10152481","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The price of certainty: iterative decoding from a total power perspective","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Sahai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144722S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601065,"authors":[{"name":"Shuchin Aeron","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shuchin","lastName":"Aeron","id":"37283102000"},{"name":"Manqi Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Manqi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292301600"},{"name":"Venkatesh Saligrama","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Saligrama","id":"37301183700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2670-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4601065","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"abstract":"We consider the problem of recovering sparse phenomena from projections of noisy data, a topic of interest in compressed sensing.

We first present bounds for two different sensing channels: (A) i.i.d. Gaussian observations (B) Correlated observations.

We use coalitional game theory to investigate such resource pooling and cooperation between operators.We use utility functions to model user satisfaction, and show that the resulting coalitional game has the property that if all operators cooperate (i.e., form a grand coalition) then there is an operating point that maximizes the sum utility over the operators while providing the operators revenues such that no subset of operators has an incentive to break away from the coalition. We investigate whether such operating points can result in utility unfairness between users of the various operators. We also study other revenue sharing concepts, namely, the nucleolus and the Shapely value. Such investigations throw light on criteria for operators to accept or reject subscribers, based on the service level agreements proposed by them. We also investigate the situation in which only certain subsets of operators may be willing to cooperate.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601066","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601066.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601066","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","startPage":"310","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coalitional game model for spectrum pooling in wireless data access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601066","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"A coalitional game model for spectrum pooling in wireless data access networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601066/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601066/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152483","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coalitional game model for spectrum pooling in wireless data access networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Sarkar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105771S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601067,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Wiechman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Wiechman","id":"37294297700"},{"name":"Igal Sason","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Igal","lastName":"Sason","id":"37283328500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2670-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4601067","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601067","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Block codes","Decoding","Memoryless systems","Upper bound","AWGN channels","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction codes","maximum likelihood decoding","memoryless systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere packing bound","ISP bound","symmetric memoryless channels","finite-length error-correcting codes","arbitrary list decoder","maximum-likelihood decoding"]}],"abstract":"We present an improved sphere-packing (ISP) bound for finite-length error-correcting codes whose transmission takes place over symmetric memoryless channels, and the codes are decoded by an arbitrary list decoder.

Further, we propose channel and queue length based routing/scheduling algorithms that achieve the above throughput region.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On throughput optimality with delayed network-state information","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601070","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601070.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601070","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"On throughput optimality with delayed network-state information","conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601070/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152486","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On throughput optimality with delayed network-state information","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Shakkottai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062207S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601071,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Haifa, IL"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["CWCSPR, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Oren Somekh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University Princeton, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Somekh","id":"38336938100"},{"name":"H.

Three scenarios are considered that present different trade-offs between global processing at the central unit and local processing at the base stations and different requirements in terms of codebook information (CI) at the BSs: 1) local encoding with CI limited to a subset of nearby BSs; 2) mixed local and central encoding with only local CI; 3) central encoding with oblivious cells (no CI). Three transmission strategies are proposed that provide achievable rates for the considered scenarios. Performance is evaluated in asymptotic regimes of interest (high backhaul capacity and extreme signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) and further corroborated by numerical results. The major finding of this work is that central encoding with oblivious cells is a very attractive option for both ease of implementation and performance, unless the application of interest requires high data rate (i.e., high SNR) and the backhaul capacity is not allowed to increase with the SNR. In this latter cases, some form of CI at the BSs becomes necessary.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2008.4601071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601007","startPage":"345","endPage":"349","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594623/4601007/04601071.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2008.4601071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint multi-cell processing for downlink channels with limited-capacity backhaul","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Gain","Upper bound","Base stations","Multiplexing","Downlink","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint multicell processing","downlink channel capacity","encoding","cellular system","base station","finite-capacity backhaul","global processing","central unit-local processing","codebook information","transmission strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint multi-cell processing for downlink channels with limited-capacity backhaul","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601071/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601071/","accessionNumber":"10152487","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","conferenceDate":"27 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint multi-cell processing for downlink channels with limited-capacity backhaul","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Shamai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049816S","chronDate":"Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594623","isNumber":"4601007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594623","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4601007","articleId":"4601071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4601083,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chen Meng","id":"37087395608"},{"name":"Jamal Tuqan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Tuqan","id":"37295155800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2670-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4601083","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Polynomials","Image reconstruction","Nickel","IIR filters","Sufficient conditions","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized periodic nonuniform sampling","nonbandlimited signals","continuous time signal","Nyquist rate","coprime integers","multi-input multi-output discrete-time model","perfect signal reconstruction","FIR filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Periodic Non-Uniform Sampling","Finite Rate of Innovations","Multirate DSP","Wavelets","Sylvester"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601083","abstract":"A new paradigm for the periodic non uniform sampling of a class of non bandlimited signals was recently proposed.

We derive a new multi-input multi-output (MIMO) discrete-time model, and then use this model to obtain a set of necessary conditions for perfect signal reconstruction with FIR filters.

In the generalized cognitive radio system the transmission rates of the primary users are assumed to be pre-determined such that each primary user is decodable at its (primary) receiver in the GIC consisting only of the primary transmitter-receiver pairs. We investigate the problem of selecting an active set of secondary users that are allowed to co-exist with the primary users and allocating rates to them under the constraints that each primary user achieves its pre-determined rate and no primary receiver decodes any secondary user. Each secondary receiver however is free to decode any other user whose codebook it is aware of.

The performance of classifiers and the interpretability of generated rules are of major importance in these systems. In past research, some genetic-based algorithms have been used for the rule learning process. These genetic fuzzy systems have utilized different approaches to encode rules. In this paper, we have proposed a novel steady- state genetic algorithm to extract a compact set of good fuzzy rules from numerical data (SGERD). The selection mechanism of this algorithm is nonrandom, and only the best individuals can survive. Our approach is very simple and fast, and can be applied to high-dimensional problems with numerical attributes. To select the rules having high generalization capabilities, our algorithm makes use of some rule- and data-dependent parameters. We have also proposed an enhancing function that modifies the rule evaluation measures in order to assess the candidate rules more effectively before their selection.

Although the model based visual feedback can partly solve this problem, due to the complication of nano environment, it is difficult to accurately describe the behavior of nano-objects with a model. The modeling error will lead to an inaccurate feedback and a failed manipulation. In this paper, a Kalman filter is developed to real time detect this modeling error. During manipulation, the residual between the estimated behavior and the visual display behavior is real time updated. The residual's Mahalanobis distance is calculated and compared with an threshold to determine whether there is a position error. Once the threshold is exceeded, an alarm signal will be triggered to tell the system there is a position error. Furthermore, the position error can be on-line corrected by local scan method. With the assistance of Kalman filter and local scan, the position error not only can be real-time detected, but also can be online corrected. The visual display keeps matching with the real manipulation result during the whole manipulation process, which significantly improve the efficiency of the AFM based nano-assembly. Experiments of manipulating nano-particles are presented to verify the effectiveness of Kalman filter and local scan method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591421/4601121/04601149.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2007.4601149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2007.4601149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time position error detecting in nanomanipulation using Kalman filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Kalman filters","Real time systems","Force","Distance measurement","End effectors","Haptic interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","error detection","fault diagnosis","haptic interfaces","Kalman filters","nanoparticles","nanotechnology","real-time systems","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time position error detection","nanomanipulation","Kalman filter","atomic force microscopy","AFM based nanoassembly","nanoparticles","fault diagnosis","visual feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Real-time position error detecting in nanomanipulation using Kalman filter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601149/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"10152282","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time position error detecting in nanomanipulation using Kalman filter","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NANO07-028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08503S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591421","isNumber":"4601121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591421","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4601121","articleId":"4601149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601152,"authors":[{"name":"James T.

Physical effects such as dielectrophoresis and electroporation can be used to manipulate particles in solution to coordinate a sequence of bioanalytical processing steps. Dielectrophoresis is accomplished with non-uniform electric fields that can polarize particles in suspension and exert static or translational forces. Electroporation is accomplished with high-strength electric fields that can create pores on the plasma membranes of cells. Membrane breakdown under high voltage is associated with cell death and a dispersal of cell contents including nucleic acids and protein. This paper presents summaries of multiple experiments in both dielectrophoresis and electroporation. In the electroporation experiments, carbon nanotubes were used to enhance electric field strengths with the goal of reducing the voltage requirements for portable lab-on-a-chip devices with strict power limitations. The concept is to create a sample preparation device which is capable of separating cells into multiple chambers for cell lysis by carbon nanotubes and releasing their DNA for further analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2007.4601152","publicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591421/4601121/04601152.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2007.4601152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Working towards a sample preparation device with carbon nanotubes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Working towards a sample preparation device with carbon nanotubes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4601152/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"10145135","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601152/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Working towards a sample preparation device with carbon nanotubes","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NANO07-035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051327S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591421","isNumber":"4601121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591421","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4601121","articleId":"4601152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4601205,"authors":[{"name":"Anurag Chaudhry","affiliation":["Integrated NanoDevices and Systems Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,\uc2a0Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Chaudhry","id":"38203138000"},{"name":"M.

With this approach, the amplitude of OMSPV (opto-electronic measurement signal of probe vibration) can be used as a feedback signal to detect and control the operation state under vibration-mode. By controlling the amplitude of AFM probe, the tip-sample interaction force can be sufficiently adjusted. Therefore, vibration-mode of AFM system can be used to manipulate nano-entities just as in using the standard contact- mode manipulation strategy. Using the novel method, nanoimaging and nanomanipulation could both be performed in vibration-mode, and the damages of the sample and probe tip can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, by detecting the amplitude of OMSPV change during operation, the precise position information between the probe tip and nano-entities (e.g., CNTs) can be determined automatically as well. Experiments show that the amplitude of OMSPV will be in USPV (unstable state of probe vibration) when the tip is at the edge of CNTs due to the real-time adjustment of parameters of the AFM control system. Such USPV can be used to determine whether the manipulation succeeds in real-time.

single cell mechanical characterization of W303 Yeast cells inside Environmental-SEM","abstract":"We present the environmental-SEM (ESEM)-nanomanipulator system for in-situ measurement of mechanical properties of the yeast cells (W303 strain). This enhanced ESEM system comprises of a standard ESEM instrument as a nano imaging tool, a cooling stage as a cellular biology's humidity controller and 7 D.O.F. linear actuators as nanomanipulator/effector. Two types of experiments have been conducted, i.e. mechanical properties of individual yeast cells and forces on cell-substrate area. Different kinds of spring constants (0.02 N/m, 0.09 N/m and 0.7 N/m) and tip's shapes (sharp, flat and needle-like) of the cantilevers have been used during the experiments. From the analysis, the compressed forces needed to penetrate the cell wall of the yeast cells using sharp and flat tips (0.02 N/m for both) are in the range of 87-278 nN and 57-207 nN respectively. Locality mechanical measurement has been performed using needle-like tip (0.09 N/m) on single-cell and mother-daughter cells where the elastic properties of the cells are in the range of 1.32-3.95 MPa. In addition to the above data, we have also investigated forces on cell-substrate area which can be divided into noncontact and contact forces. Under noncontact forces, average electrostatic forces between Au tip-Al substrate and tip-cell surfaces are measured to be 16 plusmn 2 nN and 5 plusmn 2 nN respectively. While under contact forces, two types of surface adhesions are measured which are cantilever's tip-wet surface adhesion and cell-surface adhesion where the release forces for each adhesion are 1107 plusmn 129 nN and 26578 nN respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601357/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10152231","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601357/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"In-situ single cell mechanical characterization of W303 Yeast cells inside Environmental-SEM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-situ single cell mechanical characterization of W303 Yeast cells inside Environmental-SEM","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NANO07-265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061038S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591421","isNumber":"4601121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591421","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4601121","articleId":"4601357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4601417,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Conventionally, for solid-state qubits, this is achieved by generating the control signal at 300 K and transmitting it along very long coaxial cables that span from 300 K to sub-K (typically les 500 mK), then reading out the response from charge proximity sensors such as single-electron transistors along similar lengths of cable. Our approach is to fabricate the classical controller and observer circuits using a commercial foundry processed silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) RFCMOS technology for operation at low temperatures (either at 4.2 K, 1 K, or sub-K). We have demonstrated SOS-CMOS NFET and PFET device operation at 4.2 K, and sub-K that showed deviations from their 300 K characteristics, but with further experiments these were shown to have minimal effects on control circuit function. Using these results, we have fabricated and demonstrated a low-power proof-of-concept SOS-CMOS controller circuit (monostable 100 ps voltage-pulse generator) that can operate at sub-K temperatures in a dilution refrigerator. We briefly discuss experimental and conceptual schemes with which we can develop qubit control systems for cryogenic and lower temperatures. These low temperature experiments also demonstrate that commercial SOS RF-CMOS technology can be feasible for other low temperature and low power applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591421/4601121/04601417.pdf","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1287","publicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2007.4601417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2007.4601417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum bit controller and observer circuits in SOS-CMOS technology for gigahertz low-temperature operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Temperature control","Voltage measurement","Observers","Process control","Quantum computing","FETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect transistor circuits","readout electronics","single electron transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum bit controller","observer circuits","SOS-CMOS technology","readout","charge proximity sensors","single-electron transistors","RFCMOS technology","temperature 300 K","temperature 4.2 K","temperature 1 K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOSFETs","control systems","cryogenic electronics","quantum effect semiconductor devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quantum bit controller and observer circuits in SOS-CMOS technology for gigahertz low-temperature operation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601417/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"10152416","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum bit controller and observer circuits in SOS-CMOS technology for gigahertz low-temperature operation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NANO07-329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076829S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591421","isNumber":"4601121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591421","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4601121","articleId":"4601417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601428,"authors":[{"name":"John D.H.

This paper outlines our initial efforts to develop PDMS-based pump and mixer designs compatible with our existing electrochemical biosensor. The eventual goal is to use these preliminary designs and numerical and experimental test results from various microfluidic components in PDMS in order to build an integrated lab-on-a-chip for rapid bacterial pathogen detection. Preliminary active mixing tests show at a four-fold improvement in the resulting electrochemical signal amplitude, when compared to flow through the microfluidic structure without mixing, as well as when compared to manual mixing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591421/4601121/04601428.pdf","startPage":"1330","endPage":"1334","publicationTitle":"2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO)","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2007.4601428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2007.4601428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microfluidic system for rapid bacterial pathogen detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microorganisms","Mixers","Pumps","Probes","Mathematical model","Biosensors","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","biosensors","DNA","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","microorganisms","nanobiotechnology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic","bacterial pathogen detection","MEMS electrochemical biosensor","urine","DNA oligonucleotide probes","16S rRNA","lab-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PDMS","MEMS","bacteria","infectious disease"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A microfluidic system for rapid bacterial pathogen detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601428/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"10152427","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microfluidic system for rapid bacterial pathogen detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"NANO07-342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05194S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591421","isNumber":"4601121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591421","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4601121","articleId":"4601428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601434,"authors":[{"name":"Jeyadeepan Jeganathan","affiliation":["ECE Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Jeyadeepan","lastName":"Jeganathan","id":"37573463000"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["ECE Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"},{"name":"Leszek Szczecinski","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Leszek","lastName":"Szczecinski","id":"37266100600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4601434","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":646,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":7626},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601434","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Samarium","Detectors","Transmitting antennas","Performance gain","MIMO","Maximum likelihood detection","Quadrature amplitude modulation","AWGN","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial modulation","optimal detection","performance analysis","optimal detector","bit error probability","multiple antenna systems"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we derive the optimal detector for the so-called spatial modulation (SM) system introduced by Mesleh et al. in (Mesleh, 2006).

However, for irregular codes designed for the sum-product decoder, linear scaling can hinder the performance. The problem of code design for MS and linear scaling min-sum (LSMS) decoders have been recently investigated. It is shown that the gap to the capacity for LSMS codes is better than MS codes, but compared to sum-product codes the gap is still considerable. In this letter, a modified MS decoding is proposed and studied. We use the stability analysis of density evolution to show that the proposed method allows for a larger fraction of edges connected to degree-2 variable nodes than LSMS codes. Finally, by designing codes based on the modified method, we show that compared to MS and LSMS codes, a smaller gap to the capacity can indeed be achieved while the complexity of decoding remains essentially the same.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4601446/","accessionNumber":"10158147","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of an improved min-sum decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of an improved min-sum decoder","sourcePdf":"cl_0808_581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05691S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4601432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"4601432","articleId":"4601446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4601447,"authors":[{"name":"Xian Liu","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, Little Rock, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280580700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4601447","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601447","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical losses","Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Apertures","Wireless communication","Propagation losses","Optical fiber communication","Optical diffraction","Transmitting antennas","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bessel functions","error statistics","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless optical system","Bessel pointing loss factor","optical communication systems","bit error probability","diffraction-limited circular aperture","far-field effect","Bessel function"]}],"abstract":"The performance of wireless optical communication systems is affected by transmitter sway.

Both \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n nearest neighbors (KNNs) and decision tree (DT)-based KNN classifiers were employed to discriminate images of abnormal and normal tissues. The area under the curve (A\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Z</sub>\n) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was used to evaluate the discrimination performance of features in comparison to an expert observer. The leave-one-out and bootstrap techniques were used to validate the results. The A\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Z</sub>\n of DT-based KNN classifier was 0.95. Sensitivity and specificity for normal and abnormal tissue classification were 89% and 99%, respectively. In summary, NGTDM features such as PET coarseness, PET contrast, and CT coarseness extracted from FDG PET/CT images provided good discrimination performance. The clinical use of such features may lead to improvement in the accuracy of radiation targeting of HNC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","volume":"28","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"10499590","pubMedId":"19244009","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601461/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coregistered FDG PET/CT-Based Textural Characterization of Head and Neck Cancer for Radiation Treatment Planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coregistered FDG PET/CT-Based Textural Characterization of Head and Neck Cancer for Radiation Treatment Planning","sourcePdf":"tmi-hyu-2004425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079311S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4787634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"4787634","articleId":"4601461","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4601463,"authors":[{"name":"Yefeng Zheng","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yefeng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37423672200"},{"name":"Adrian Barbu","affiliation":["School of Computational Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA","Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Barbu","id":"37282897800"},{"name":"Bogdan Georgescu","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Georgescu","id":"37397668000"},{"name":"Michael Scheuering","affiliation":["Computed Tomography Division, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Scheuering","id":"37691761800"},{"name":"Dorin Comaniciu","affiliation":["Integrated Data Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Dorin","lastName":"Comaniciu","id":"37275320000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4601463","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":400,"citationCountPatent":79,"totalDownloads":3031},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Computed tomography","Automatic control","Functional analysis","Valves","Robustness","Anatomical structure","Search problems","Shape","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiovascular system","computerised tomography","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-chamber heart modeling","3-D cardiac CT Volume","marginal space learning","quantitative functional analysis","cardiac computed tomography","automatic model fitting","complex nonrigid organ","ventricular septum cusps","automatic heart chamber segmentation","anatomical structure localization","9-D similarity transformation search problem","learning-based boundary delineation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heart modeling","heart segmentation","marginal space learning","three-dimensional (3-D) object detection"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Anatomy, Cross-Sectional","Artificial Intelligence","Automatic Data Processing","Finite Element Analysis","Heart","Heart","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Cardiovascular","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Research Design","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"abstract":"We propose an automatic four-chamber heart segmentation system for the quantitative functional analysis of the heart from cardiac computed tomography (CT) volumes. Two topics are discussed: heart modeling and automatic model fitting to an unseen volume. Heart modeling is a nontrivial task since the heart is a complex nonrigid organ. The model must be anatomically accurate, allow manual editing, and provide sufficient information to guide automatic detection and segmentation. Unlike previous work, we explicitly represent important landmarks (such as the valves and the ventricular septum cusps) among the control points of the model. The control points can be detected reliably to guide the automatic model fitting process. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in 3D CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a two-step learning problem: anatomical structure localization and boundary delineation. In both steps, we exploit the recent advances in learning discriminative models. A novel algorithm, marginal space learning (MSL), is introduced to solve the 9-D similarity transformation search problem for localizing the heart chambers. After determining the pose of the heart chambers, we estimate the 3D shape through learning-based boundary delineation. The proposed method has been extensively tested on the largest dataset (with 323 volumes from 137 patients) ever reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the fastest with a speed of 4.0 s per volume (on a dual-core 3.2-GHz processor) for the automatic segmentation of all four chambers.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4658202/04601463.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-Chamber Heart Modeling and Automatic Segmentation for 3-D Cardiac CT Volumes Using Marginal Space Learning and Steerable Features","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2004421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4658202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2004421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Four-Chamber Heart Modeling and Automatic Segmentation for 3-D Cardiac CT Volumes Using Marginal Space Learning and Steerable Features","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301376","pubMedId":"18955181","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4601463/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-Chamber Heart Modeling and Automatic Segmentation for 3-D Cardiac CT Volumes Using Marginal Space Learning and Steerable Features","sourcePdf":"tmi-yzheng-2004421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082461S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4658202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"400","xplore-issue":"4658202","articleId":"4601463","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4601467,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"38151885100"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"},{"name":"Kwai-Man Luk","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwai-Man","lastName":"Luk","id":"37280438800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4601467","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1490},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Antenna radiation patterns","Power dividers","Microstrip antennas","Mutual coupling","Feeds","Dipole antennas","Wireless LAN","Antenna measurements","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","monopole antenna arrays","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization diversity antenna","portable wireless device","radiation pattern","WLAN application","inverted-L antenna","monopole antenna","envelope correlation coefficient","compact two-element antenna","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","diversity antenna","microstrip antennas","mutual coupling"]}],"abstract":"A compact two-element antenna with both pattern and polarization diversities and high isolation for 2.4 GHz WLAN application is reported.

A new low-cost method for converting the amplitudes of these sine/cosine transducer signals into a measure of the input angle without using lookup tables is proposed. The new method takes advantage of the components used to operate the resolver, the excitation (carrier) signal in particular. This is a feedforward method based on comparing the amplitudes of the resolver signals to those of the excitation signal together with another shifted by pi/2. A simple method is then used to estimate the shaft angle through this comparison technique. The poor precision of comparison of the signals around their highly nonlinear peak regions is avoided by using a simple technique that relies only on the alternating pseudolinear segments of the signals. This results in a better overall accuracy of the converter. Beside simplicity of implementation, the proposed scheme offers the advantage of robustness to amplitude fluctuation of the transducer excitation signal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resolver Angle Estimator Based on Its Excitation Signal","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2002719","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4771829/04601470.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2002719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Resolver Angle Estimator Based on Its Excitation Signal","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4601470/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10459841","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resolver Angle Estimator Based on Its Excitation Signal","sourcePdf":"tie-benbrahim-2002719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054196S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4771829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4771829","articleId":"4601470","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4601472,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris Psychoudakis","affiliation":["Electroscience Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Psychoudakis","id":"38498267900"},{"name":"William Moulder","affiliation":["Electroscience Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Moulder","id":"37393182600"},{"name":"Chi-Chih Chen","affiliation":["Electroscience Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chi-Chih","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280734700"},{"name":"Heping Zhu","affiliation":["Electroscience Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Heping","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37691881700"},{"name":"John L.

In this study, we apply a machine learning technique [support vector machines (SVMs)] for automated recognition of OSAS types from their nocturnal ECG recordings. A total of 125 sets of nocturnal ECG recordings acquired from normal subjects (OSAS- ) and subjects with OSAS (OSAS+), each of approximately 8 h in duration, were analyzed. Features extracted from successive wavelet coefficient levels after wavelet decomposition of signals due to heart rate variability (HRV) from RR intervals and ECG-derived respiration (EDR) from R waves of QRS amplitudes were used as inputs to the SVMs to recognize OSAS +/- subjects. Using leave-one-out technique, the maximum accuracy of classification for 83 training sets was found to be 100% for SVMs using a subset of selected combination of HRV and EDR features. Independent test results on 42 subjects showed that it correctly recognized 24 out of 26 OSAS + subjects and 15 out of 16 OSAS - subjects (accuracy = 92.85%; Cohen's kappa value of 0.85). For estimating the relative severity of OSAS, the posterior probabilities of SVM outputs were calculated and compared with respective apnea/hypopnea index. These results suggest superior performance of SVMs in OSAS recognition supported by wavelet-based features of ECG. The results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in an ECG-based screening device that can aid a sleep specialist in the initial assessment of patients with suspected OSAS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Machines for Automated Recognition of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome From ECG Recordings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2008.2004495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/4740174/04601477.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2008.2004495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Machines for Automated Recognition of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome From ECG Recordings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370413","pubMedId":"19129022","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Machines for Automated Recognition of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome From ECG Recordings","sourcePdf":"titb-khandoker-2004495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068452S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","isNumber":"4740174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"253","articleId":"4601477","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4601480,"authors":[{"name":"Necip Sahan","affiliation":["Power Amplifier Technologies Department, Aselsan, Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4616565/4601480/4601480-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Necip Sahan was born in Denizli, Turkey, on February 2, 1981.

Simulated performances of the designed networks using the proposed model possess high conformity with the empirical performance of the corresponding realized networks. Therefore, broadband TLT networks with low insertion loss, high power-handling capability, and low return loss are realized. RF power combiner/divider networks with wide frequency bandwidth and high isolation are also implemented. By using class-B biased pushpull network topology, a linear and wideband RF PA is realized with high drain efficiency at high output power levels. In order to broaden the operating frequency range of the indicated amplifier, a novel technique for TLT utilization that matches the output impedance of the RF power transistor in wideband is proposed and realized.

This paper describes the design and manufacturing process of new stretchable high-frequency interconnects with meander-shaped conductors in a coplanar waveguide topology. The novel interconnects are produced based on laser-ablation of a copper foil, which is then embedded in a highly stretchable bio-compatible silicone material. Measurements on prototypes of the designed stretchable high-frequency interconnects revealed a maximal magnitude of -14 dB for the reflection coefficient and a minimal magnitude of -4 dB for the transmission coefficient in the frequency band up to 3 GHz. The influence of stretch on the performance of the high-frequency interconnects was analyzed using a stretch testing machine. The results showed that nor the magnitude, neither the phase of the transmission coefficient was influenced by elongations up to 20%.","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2008.927811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/4674527/04601494.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2008.927811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674527","startPage":"802","endPage":"808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Manufacturing of Stretchable High-Frequency Interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Manufacturing of Stretchable High-Frequency Interconnects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348132","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4601494/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Manufacturing of Stretchable High-Frequency Interconnects","sourcePdf":"tadvp-huyghe-927811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059913S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4674527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4674527","articleId":"4601494","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601498,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhamid Tayebi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Tayebi","id":"37273427700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4601498","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":235,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2595},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Quaternions","Torque control","Velocity measurement","Control systems","Attitude control","Error correction","Damping","Angular velocity","Velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","attitude control","feedback","tracking","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit quaternion-based dynamic output feedback","rigid body attitude tracking problem","auxiliary dynamical system","control law","velocity-free control scheme","global asymptotic stability","control torque","control gain","dynamical spacecraft model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attitude tracking","output feedback","rigid body"]}],"abstract":"In this note, we propose a quaternion-based dynamic output feedback for the attitude tracking problem of a rigid body without velocity measurement. Our approach consists of introducing an auxiliary dynamical system whose output (which is also a unit quaternion) is used in the control law together with the unit quaternion representing the attitude tracking error. Roughly speaking, the necessary damping that would have been achieved by the direct use of the angular velocity can be achieved, in our approach, by the vector part \\mathtilde \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n of the error signal between the output of the auxiliary system and the unit quaternion tracking error.

The fuzzy neural network is realized with a developed back propagation neural network, by which the fault types of a bearing can be automatically distinguished on the basis of the possibility distributions of symptom parameters sequentially. The non-dimensional symptom parameters which reflect the features of signal measured for the diagnosis are also described in time domain. The faults that often occur in a bearing, such as the outer race flaw, inner race flaw, and roller element flaw, are used for the diagnosis. Practical examples of diagnosis for a rolling bearing used in rotating machinery are shown to verify the efficiency of the method.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601634","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601634.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential diagnosis for rolling bearing using fuzzy neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sequential diagnosis for rolling bearing using fuzzy neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10176259","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4601634/","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential diagnosis for rolling bearing using fuzzy neural network","confLoc":"Xian","sourcePdf":"AIM08-010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063843S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594793","isNumber":"4601617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594793","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4601617","articleId":"4601634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4601639,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Wang","id":"37292860900"},{"name":"Yingying Wang","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yingying Wang","id":"37697579200"},{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Kun Wang","id":"37290495000"},{"name":"Houxiang Zhang","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Houxiang Zhang","id":"37293133800"},{"name":"Jianwei Zhang","affiliation":["Cognitive Technology Laboratory, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China","TAMS, Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"lastName":"Jianwei Zhang","id":"37281460600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2494-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4601639","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":768},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Joints","Adhesives","Kinematics","Climbing robots","Force","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["climbing caterpillar robots kinematics models","vermicular motion","pine caterpillar robot","redundant actuation","inchworm robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Climbing robot","Caterpillar","Module","Redundant actuating"]}],"abstract":"Based on the vermicular motion of the pine caterpillar and inchworm, this paper presents two novel module climbing caterpillar kinematics models. The analysis of the valid gaits and climbing safety of them indicates the differences of two models. The pine caterpillar model with all active joints has the disadvantage of introducing the redundant actuating to its locomotion but higher security than the inchworm model because of its more valid gaits. Two prototypes following the above two models are respectively constructed from some newly developed real adhesion and actuation modules to testify the climbing abilities of two caterpillar-like robots. The experiments show the sideslip of the suckers on the pine caterpillar robot induced by the redundant actuating and the locomotion ability of the inchworm robot on vertical wall. Besides that, an unsymmetrical gait is adopted by the inchworm robot to improve its adhesion reliability on the wall. At last, a new kinematics model of the pine caterpillar robot based on passive joints is proposed to solve the redundant actuating problem.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601639","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601639.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the kinematics of module climbing caterpillar robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601639/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the kinematics of module climbing caterpillar robots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176264","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601639/","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the kinematics of module climbing caterpillar robots","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"AIM08-015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060242S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594793","isNumber":"4601617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594793","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4601617","articleId":"4601639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601691,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We focused on the height of a robot (robot size), investigating the effect of robot size on the anxiety or threat felt by a human to be caused by a robot and the appropriate human-robot distance. We prepared three mobile robots that were 0.6 m, 1.2 m and 1.8 m tall. One of these robots approached a male subject from a distance of 3 m, at a maximum speed of 0.4 m/s, and the subject stopped the robot using a switch when he began to feel anxious. We measured the distance between the human and the robot when the subject stopped the robot. Then, we asked the subject to complete a questionnaire to evaluate differences in anxiety levels caused by robots of different sizes. As a result of the experiment based on 19 subjects, we were able to observe a tendency for the human-robot distance to increase along with the size of the robot. From the questionnaires, we found that the subjects felt most anxious with the 1.8-m-tall robots, but that some subjects also experienced anxiety with the 0.6-m-tall robots. Considering both the experimental results and the questionnaires, we conclude that 1.2 m is better than other two sizes.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601719","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601719.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Are bigger robots scary? \u2014The relationship between robot size and psychological threat\u2014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Are bigger robots scary? \u2014The relationship between robot size and psychological threat\u2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176344","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601719/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Are bigger robots scary? \u2014The relationship between robot size and psychological threat\u2014","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"AIM08-095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044214S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594793","isNumber":"4601617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594793","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4601617","articleId":"4601719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4601740,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Stramigioli","affiliation":["University of Twente IMPACT Institute, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Stramigioli","id":"37282439300"},{"name":"Gijs van Oort","affiliation":["University of Twente IMPACT Institute, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Gijs","lastName":"van Oort","id":"37568719500"},{"name":"Edwin Dertien","affiliation":["University of Twente IMPACT Institute, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Dertien","id":"37691786600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2494-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4601740","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":720},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Robots","Springs","Torque","Legged locomotion","DC motors","Energy storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient actuator","embedded robotic actuator","force profile","robotics application"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a novel concept of embedded robotic actuator is presented which has been named the very versatile energy efficient (V2E2) actuator.

Humanoid robots have multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). Because of this multi-DOF structure, whole body motion planning of humanoid robots is difficult and complex. In this paper, we separated whole body motion of humanoid robots into several partial motions. Separating whole body motion into several partial motions, we can overcome the difficulty and complexity of whole body motion planning for humanoid robots with high degrees of freedom. Each separated partial motion has only 6 DOF: X, Y, Z, Pitch, Yaw, and Roll. Based on these low-degrees of freedom, we can utilize efficient motion planning algorithm. As an algorithm of partial motion planning, the gradient-descent method was used. The correctness and efficiency of our algorithm was established by conducting simulations and experiments on the humanoid robot simulator and physical humanoid robot using the whole body motion planning algorithm developed in this research.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601805","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601805.pdf","startPage":"1041","endPage":"1046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Motion separating based whole body motion planning for humanoid robots using a gradient descent method","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176430","htmlLink":"/document/4601805/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion separating based whole body motion planning for humanoid robots using a gradient descent method","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"AIM08-181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06314S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594793","isNumber":"4601617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594793","xplore-issue":"4601617","articleId":"4601805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601811,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-zhu Zhou","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic Equipment Structure, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Jin-zhu Zhou","id":"37087829004"},{"name":"Jin Huang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic Equipment Structure, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Jin Huang","id":"37087312105"},{"name":"Jing Zhou","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic Equipment Structure, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Jing Zhou","id":"37087494870"},{"name":"Hua-ping Li","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic Equipment Structure, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Hua-ping Li","id":"37087825268"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2494-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4601811","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601811","abstract":"An accurate friction model is necessary for friction compensation in radar servo systems or industrial robots.

The controller comprises a back propagation NN (BPNN), a radial basis function NN (RBFNN) and a SMC. The BPNN is used to adaptively adjust the switching gain of the SMC on-line so as to avoid the whippings. The RBFNN is used to perform system identification and parameter prediction. The experimental results show that the NNSMC could improve the stability and reliability of the system, and is superior to traditional SMC at response speed, steady-state tracking error and resisting disturbance in the regenerative-braking process. Additionally, it can recover more energy, lengthen batteriespsila life, and increase the driving range than SMC by about 6%. This is very significant for saving energy.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601836","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1224","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601836.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regenerative-Braking Sliding Mode Control of Electric Vehicle Based on Neural Network Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Control systems","Mathematical model","Batteries","Process control","Electric vehicles","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","regenerative braking","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regenerative-braking","sliding mode control","electric vehicle","neural network identification","radial basis function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric vehicle","Regenerative braking","Neural network","Sliding mode control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Regenerative-Braking Sliding Mode Control of Electric Vehicle Based on Neural Network Identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176461","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regenerative-Braking Sliding Mode Control of Electric Vehicle Based on Neural Network Identification","confLoc":"Xian","sourcePdf":"AIM08-212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076903S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594793","isNumber":"4601617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4601617","articleId":"4601836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4601837,"authors":[{"name":"Mamoru Minami","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan"],"lastName":"Mamoru Minami","id":"37087305544"},{"name":"Toshiaki Yoshida","affiliation":["Graduate school of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan"],"lastName":"Toshiaki Yoshida","id":"37087308531"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2494-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4601837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine animals","Gallium","Approximation methods","Robots","Visual servoing","Real time systems","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","motion estimation","neural nets","position control","predictive control","robot vision","servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction servoing","escaping fish","neural network","fish motion prediction","online learning","hand-eye robot visual servoing","fish position estimation","fish catching experiments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601837","abstract":"This paper presents a method to predict a fish motion by Neural Network (N.N.) with on-line learning when a robot is pursuing fish-catching by a net at hand through hand-eye robot visual servoing.

Weighted-sum method is used to convert multiobjective optimization to single objective problem. Then, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is used, based on using Newtonpsilas method and Kune-Tucker conditions, to solve optimization problem. Maximization of power generation benefits and minimization of specific water consumption are assumed as objective functions. In this study, stochastic flows from external sources that enter to each reservoir (like rivers and rain) are assumed based on some scenarios for dry, median, and wet years. These various dry, median and wet water inflow scenarios are generated from the gathered fifty-year historical inflow measurements. Besides, turbine power generation is obtained from hill diagrams. The case study refers to hydropower plants network in Karoon River Basin in southern Iran. The corresponding optimization model has 240 variables and 660 constraints and MATLAB software is used to develop the model. Solving such non-linear multiobjective optimization model, annual rule curves that show optimal operation for reservoirs and total yearly energy production are presented for control of the cascaded units.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601846","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601846.pdf","startPage":"1278","endPage":"1283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-linear multiobjective optimization for control of hydropower plants network","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176471","htmlLink":"/document/4601846/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-linear multiobjective optimization for control of hydropower plants network","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"AIM08-222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060963S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594793","isNumber":"4601617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594793","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4601617","articleId":"4601846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4601860,"authors":[{"name":"Yongmin Zhong","affiliation":["Robotics & Mechatronics Research Laboratory, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Yongmin Zhong","id":"37087571508"},{"name":"Bijan Shirinzadeh","affiliation":["Robotics & Mechatronics Research Laboratory, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Bijan Shirinzadeh","id":"37087421794"},{"name":"Yanling Tian","affiliation":["Robotics & Mechatronics Research Laboratory, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Yanling Tian","id":"37087649949"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2494-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4601860","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601860","abstract":"This paper presents a new methodology based on neural dynamics for robot path planning. The target activity is treated as an energy source injected into the neural system and is propagated through the local connectivity of neurons in the state space by neural dynamics. The elegant properties of harmonic functions are incorporated in the neural system by formulating the local connectivity of neurons as a harmonic function. An improved Hopfield-type neural network model is established for propagating the target activity among neurons in the manner of physical heat conduction, which guarantees that the target and obstacles remain at the peak and the bottom of the activity landscape of the neural network, respectively. The real-time collision-free robot motion is planned through the dynamic neural network activity without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, without explicitly searching over the global free workspace or searching collision paths, and without any learning procedures. Examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601860","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1366","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601860.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new neural network for robot path planning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Robots","Path planning","Collision avoidance","Real time systems","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","Hopfield neural nets","mobile robots","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot path planning","neural dynamics","harmonic function","Hopfield-type neural network model","collision-free robot motion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","Hopfield neural network","collision avoidance and analogy systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new neural network for robot path planning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601860/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176485","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new neural network for robot path planning","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"AIM08-236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043166S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594793","isNumber":"4601617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594793","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4601617","articleId":"4601860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4601862,"authors":[{"name":"Yuelin Gao","affiliation":["School of Information & Computation Science, University of North National University, Yinchuan, Ningxia, China"],"lastName":"Yuelin Gao","id":"37087600257"},{"name":"Junmin Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics & Computer, University of Ningxia, Yinchuan, Ningxia, China"],"lastName":"Junmin Liu","id":"37088128199"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2494-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2495-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4601862","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601862","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Approximation algorithms","Classification algorithms","Accuracy","Convergence","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","evolutionary computation","mathematical operators","neural nets","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BP neural network training","modified differential evolution algorithm","mutation operator","global search","local search","convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["differential evolution algorithm","mutation operator","BP neural network","application"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AIM.2008.4601862","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594793/4601617/04601862.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","startPage":"1373","endPage":"1377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2008.4601862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified differential evolution algorithm and its application in the training of BP neural network","abstract":"The paper is given a new modified differential evolution (MDE) algorithm in which a novel mutation operator is introduced.

As more and more cores/threads are placed on-die, the pressure on the memory subsystem is rapidly increasing. To address this issue, we explore DRAM cache architectures for CMP platforms. In this paper, we investigate the impact of introducing a low latency, large capacity and high bandwidth DRAM-based cache between the last level SRAM cache and memory subsystem. We first show the potential benefits of large DRAM caches for key commercial server workloads. As the primary hurdle to achieving these benefits with DRAM caches is the tag space overheads associated with them, we identify the most efficient DRAM cache organization and investigate various options. Our results show that the combination of 8-bit partial tags and 2-way sectoring achieves the highest performance (20% to 70%) with the lowest tag space (<25%) overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601880","publicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591423/4601871/04601880.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring DRAM cache architectures for CMP server platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Exploring DRAM cache architectures for CMP server platforms","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601880/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10158815","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601880/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring DRAM cache architectures for CMP server platforms","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1.3.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049957S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4601881,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumary","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, US"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Kumary"},{"name":"Partha Kunduz","affiliation":["Microprocessor Technology Labs, Intel Corp., Santa Clara, CA 95052, USA"],"firstName":"Partha","lastName":"Kunduz"},{"name":"Arvind P.

These networks face unique design constraints and are required to provide extremely fast and high bandwidth communication, yet meet tight power and area budgets. In this paper, we present a detailed design of our on-chip network router targeted at a 36-core shared-memory CMP system in 65 nm technology. Our design targets an aggressive clock frequency of 3.6 GHz, thus posing tough design challenges that led to several unique circuit and microarchitectural innovations and design choices, including a novel high throughput and low latency switch allocation mechanism, a non-speculative single-cycle router pipeline which uses advanced bundles to remove control setup overhead, a low-complexity virtual channel allocator and a dynamically-managed shared buffer design which uses prefetching to minimize critical path delay. Our router takes up 1.19 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n area and expends 551 mW power at 10% activity, delivering a single-cycle no-load latency at 3.6 GHz clock frequency while achieving apeak switching data rate in excess of 4.6 Tbits/sper router node.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601881","publicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591423/4601871/04601881.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4.6Tbits/s 3.6GHz single-cycle NoC router with a novel switch allocator in 65nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A 4.6Tbits/s 3.6GHz single-cycle NoC router with a novel switch allocator in 65nm CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601881/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10158816","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601881/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4.6Tbits/s 3.6GHz single-cycle NoC router with a novel switch allocator in 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1.3.3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06612S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4601895,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Hossein Gholamipour","affiliation":["University of California, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, Irvine"],"firstName":"Amir Hossein","lastName":"Gholamipour","id":"37660357000"},{"name":"Elaheh Bozorgzadeh","affiliation":["University of California, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Elaheh","lastName":"Bozorgzadeh","id":"37278939300"},{"name":"Sudarshan Banerjee","affiliation":["Liga Systems, Sunnyvale, Ca, USA","University of California, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Sudarshan","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37276976000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1257-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1258-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4601895","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-aware co-processor selection for embedded processors on FPGAs","abstract":"In this paper, we present co-processor selection problem for minimum energy consumption in hw/sw co-design on FPGAs with dual power mode.

It was simulated to have a 2 Gbps throughput, and consume only 260 mW. This first large-scale 3D application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with fine-grain (5mum) vertical interconnects is made possible by jointly developing a complete automated 3D design flow from a commercial 2-D design flow combined with the needed 3D-design tools. The 3D implementation is estimated to offer more than 10 xpower-delay-area product improvement over its corresponding 2D implementation.

In this paper, we study the scan chain construction for 3D ICs, examining the impact of 3D technologies on scan chain ordering. Three different 3D scan chain design approaches (namely, VIA3D, MAP3D, and OPT3D) are proposed and compared, with the experimental results for ISCAS89 benchmark circuits. The advantages as well as disadvantages for each approach are discussed. The results show that both MAP3D and VIA3D approaches require no changes of 2D scan chain algorithms, but OPT3D can achieve the best wire length reduction for the scan chain design. The average scan chain wire length of six ISCAS89 benchmarks obtained from OPT3D has 46.0% reduction compared to the 2D scan chain design.

In this work, we propose to directly predict reuse-distances via instruction-based (PC) prediction and use this information for cache level optimizations. In this paper, we choose as our target for optimization the replacement policy of the L2 cache, because the gap between the LRU and the theoretical optimal replacement algorithm is comparatively large for L2 caches. This indicates that, in many situations, there is ample room for improvement. We evaluate our reusedistance based replacement policy using a subset of the most memory intensive SPEC2000 and our results show significant benefits across the board.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601909","publicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591423/4601871/04601909.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache replacement based on reuse-distance prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601909/","displayDocTitle":"Cache replacement based on reuse-distance prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10160088","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601909/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache replacement based on reuse-distance prediction","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5.1.5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087746S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4601912,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Wong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Wong","id":"37289468600"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280563100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1257-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1258-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4601912","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601912","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wire","Three dimensional displays","Tiles","Thermal analysis","Thermal factors","Bonding","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","integrated circuit bonding","integrated circuit design","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["whitespace redistribution","heat dissipation","3D stacked IC design","device layers impose certain restrictions","bonding style"]}],"abstract":"One of the biggest challenges in 3D stacked IC design is heat dissipation.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm and hardware design for a DFP adder. The adder performs addition and subtraction on 64-bit operands that use the IEEE P754 binary encoding of DFP numbers, widely known as the binary integer decimal (BID) encoding. The BID adder uses a novel hardware component for decimal digit counting and an enhanced version of a previously published BID rounding unit. By adding more sophisticated control, operations are performed with variable latency to optimize for common cases. We show that a BID-based DFP adder design can be achieved with a modest area increase compared to a single 2-stage pipelined 64-bit fixed-point multiplier. Over 70% of the BID adderpsilas area is due the 64-bit fixed-point multiplier, which can be shared with a binary floating-point multiplier and hardware for other DFP operations. To our knowledge, this is the first hardware design for adding and subtracting IEEE P754 BID-encoded DFP numbers.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601915","publicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591423/4601871/04601915.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hardware design of a Binary Integer Decimal-based floating-point adder","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601915/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10158826","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601915/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware design of a Binary Integer Decimal-based floating-point adder","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5.3.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047114S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4601916,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Hickmann","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Hickmann","id":"37660863600"},{"name":"Andrew Krioukov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Krioukov","id":"37698139900"},{"name":"Michael Schulte","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schulte","id":"37273849400"},{"name":"Mark Erle","affiliation":["International Business Machines Corporation, Macungie, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Erle","id":"37273843900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1257-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1258-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4601916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":741},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exception handling","floating point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel IEEE P754 decimal floating-point multiplier","decimal floating-point multiplication","floating-point arithmetic","parallel fixed-point decimal multiplier","decimal digit encodings","exception handling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601916","abstract":"Decimal floating-point multiplication is important in many commercial applications including banking, tax calculation, currency conversion, and other financial areas.

In order to refine manufacturing processes and develop circuit design techniques to cope with variability, we must be able to accurately and precisely characterize the variations that occur. In this paper, we introduce a technique for characterizing combinational path delay variations by measuring a designer-controlled number of register-to-register delays in manufactured ICs with negative-skewed shadow registers. This technique enables delay measurements to be performed with at-speed tests that are run in parallel with and are orthogonal to other testing techniques, and therefore does not add combinatorial complexity to the testing process. This technique can be implemented cost-effectively on a large number of otherwise unobservable internal combinational paths to get accurate, precise data about delay variability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4601924/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10160097","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Negative-skewed shadow registers for at-speed delay variation characterization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative-skewed shadow registers for at-speed delay variation characterization","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6.2.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047345S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4601941,"authors":[{"name":"Paul D.

As more elements are accurately modeled, problems associated with slow simulation are further exacerbated. Given these issues, many researchers have devised sampling techniques to reduce simulation time. When cluster sampling techniques are used, care must be taken to remove sampling and non-sampling biases. Researchers have devised clever methods for effectively reducing non-sampling bias, but little work has been proposed for efficient reduction of sampling bias (sampling regimen design). Traditionally, sampling regimen design has been an iterative process that required a full workload simulation for error comparison. In this study, a single-pass simulation technique for sampling regimen design is proposed. Using this method, thousands of sampling regimen candidates can be simultaneously evaluated. With this technique, simulation speed was increased by an average factor of 17 with a maximum increase of 73 times relative to the total workload simulation. Additionally, this technique allows the user to effectively estimate the sample error without running the entire workload.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4601941/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10160109","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Combining cluster sampling with single pass methods for efficient sampling regimen design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining cluster sampling with single pass methods for efficient sampling regimen design","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"7.3.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046421S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4601945,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Salapura","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

However, eDRAM suffers from comparatively slower access times than conventional SRAM arrays. To hide eDRAM access latencies, the Blue Gene/L(&) supercomputer implements small private prefetch caches. We present an exploration of design trade-offs for the prefetch D-cache for eDRAM. We use full system simulation to consider operating system impact. We validate our modeling environment by comparing our simulation results to measurements on actual Blue Gene systems. Actual execution times also include any system effects not modeled in our performance simulator, and confirm the selection of simulation parameters included in the model. Our experiments show that even small prefetch caches with wide lines efficiently capture spatial locality in many applications. Our 2kB private prefetch caches reduce execution time by 10% on average, effectively hiding the latency of the eDRAM-based memory system.","publicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591423/4601871/04601945.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601945","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting eDRAM bandwidth with data prefetching: simulation and measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting eDRAM bandwidth with data prefetching: simulation and measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601945/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4601945/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10158835","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting eDRAM bandwidth with data prefetching: simulation and measurements","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8.1.3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089213S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4601947,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, specification-based testing is still the norm for analog/RF because of the limitations of analog fault models. Unfortunately, as the amount of functionality packed into individual devices is increased with each generation, the cost of testing larger numbers of specifications also increases. To address this, the alternate test methodology proposed in the past, which significantly cuts costs associated with specification tests by crafting a single test stimulus and mapping the response signatures into all specifications at once, can be modified for defect-based testing as well. In this work, we explore a new type of alternate test that is more fundamental than defect-based or specification-based approaches. Rather than focusing on physical defect mechanisms or the way individual specifications are measured, fault-based alternate test studies the abstractions of physical phenomena that cause specification violations; it unifies the benefits of reduced ATE complexity of defect-based approaches and the compact stimulus-signature pairs of specification-based alternate tests.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Circuit faults","Gain","Performance evaluation","Radio frequency","Complexity theory","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test equipment","fault diagnosis","telecommunication equipment testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-based alternate test","RF components","defect-based RF testing","specification-based testing","ATE complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601947","publicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591423/4601871/04601947.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-based alternate test of RF components","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fault-based alternate test of RF components","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601947/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4601947/","accessionNumber":"10160114","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-based alternate test of RF components","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8.2.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050803S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4601950,"authors":[{"name":"Julian Pontes","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Pontes","id":"37702815000"},{"name":"Rafael Soares","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Soares","id":"37646798100"},{"name":"Ewerson Carvalho","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ewerson","lastName":"Carvalho","id":"37265249100"},{"name":"Fernando Moraes","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Moraes","id":"37265068600"},{"name":"Ney Calazans","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ney","lastName":"Calazans","id":"37265247900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1257-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1258-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4601950","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SCAFFI: An intrachip FPGA asynchronous interface based on hard macros","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591423/4601871/04601950.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"546","publicationTitle":"2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601871","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601950","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Field programmable gate arrays","Receivers","Delay","Clocks","Rails","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","network synthesis","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SCAFFI","intrachip FPGA asynchronous interface","hard macros","synchronous VLSI circuits","VLSI design","globally asynchronous, locally synchronous design","GALS","FPGAs","field programmable gate arrays","clock stretching techniques","RSA cryptography core"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4601950","abstract":"Building fully synchronous VLSI circuits is becoming less viable as circuit geometries evolve. However, before the adoption of purely asynchronous strategies in VLSI design, globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) design approaches should take over. The design of circuits using complex field programmable components like state of the art FPGAs follows this same trend. In GALS design, a critical step is the definition of asynchronous interfaces between synchronous regions. This paper proposes SCAFFI, a new asynchronous interface to interconnect modules inside FPGAs. The interface is based on clock stretching techniques to avoid metastability. Differently from other interfaces, it can use both logic levels for stretching and do not require the use of arbiters. Also, compactness of the implementation is enhanced by the use of dedicated FPGA hard macros. A GALS version implementation of an RSA cryptography core demonstrates the use of SCAFFI.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4601950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10160116","htmlLink":"/document/4601950/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SCAFFI: An intrachip FPGA asynchronous interface based on hard macros","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SCAFFI: An intrachip FPGA asynchronous interface based on hard macros","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8.3.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061387S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4591423","isNumber":"4601871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591423","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4601871","articleId":"4601950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4601953,"authors":[{"name":"Anish Muttreja","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Muttreja","id":"37282453600"},{"name":"Niket Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Niket","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37543361900"},{"name":"Niraj K.

One main design challenge in hybrid nanoelectronics is the interface (named as demux) between the highly dense nanowires in nanodevice crossbars and relatively coarse microwires in CMOS domain. The prior work on demux design use a single type of devices to realize the demultiplexing function, but hardly provides a satisfactory solution. This work proposes to combine resistor with FET to implement the demux, leading to the so-called hybrid resistor/FET-logic demux. Such hybrid demux architecture can make these two types of devices well complement each other to improve the overall demux design effectiveness.

Experimental results show that our pipelining technique is an efficient approach to maximizing LDPC decoding throughput while minimizing the area consumption. First, pipelined decoders can achieve extraordinary high throughput which non-pipelined design cannot. Second, for the same throughput, pipelined decoders use less area than non-pipelined design.

The lumped uncertainties of the VSA including unmodeled dynamics are considered and approximated by a simple NN so that the controlled system is asymptotically stable, and remains effective while process conditions vary. To cope with the reconstruction error of the NN, a sliding mode like additional robust control term is introduced. The proofs for the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and uniform asymptotic (UAS) stabilities for the closed-loop system are provided in detail via Lyapunov theory. Simulation and experimental results are reported in support of both validity and performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2008.4602032","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588253/4601965/04602032.pdf","startPage":"1028","endPage":"1034","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2008.4602032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network based Robust Adaptive Control for a Variable Stiffness Actuator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network based Robust Adaptive Control for a Variable Stiffness Actuator","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10159953","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4602032/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network based Robust Adaptive Control for a Variable Stiffness Actuator","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"0114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075304S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588253","isNumber":"4601965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588253","xplore-issue":"4601965","articleId":"4602032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4602059,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Such estimations can be used in Health Monitoring or in adaptive control applications. Usually, pure sinusoidal models are used in order to represent the mechanical vibration. The main problem of these models is they do not consider the damping phenomenon of the flexible structures. In this work, an algebraic approach is used for the fast and reliable, on line, identification of the natural frequency and its damping coefficient of a flexible-link manipulator. This method uses an exponential damping sinusoidal model in combination with the algebraic derivative method for parameter identification. The computations are performed in a time interval inferior to the first full cycle of the measured vibration signal. A single-link flexible manipulator is used to verify the estimator performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","flexible structures","frequency estimation","manipulators","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping estimation","frequency estimation","single-link flexible manipulator","algebraic identification","flexible structures","vibration analysis","adaptive control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MED.2008.4602100","publicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588253/4601965/04602100.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2008.4602100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line frequency and damping estimation in a single-link flexible manipulator based on algebraic identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On-line frequency and damping estimation in a single-link flexible manipulator based on algebraic identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602100/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602100/","accessionNumber":"10160006","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line frequency and damping estimation in a single-link flexible manipulator based on algebraic identification","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"0216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053563S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588253","isNumber":"4601965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588253","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4601965","articleId":"4602100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4602109,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Boivin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Pavillon Adrien-Pouliot, Qu\u00e9bec City, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Boivin","id":"37283610000"},{"name":"Andre Desbiens","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Pavillon Adrien-Pouliot, Qu\u00e9bec City, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Desbiens","id":"37442198400"},{"name":"Eric Gagnon","affiliation":["DRDC-Valcartier, Qu\u00e9bec City, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"37418109000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2504-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2505-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4602109","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":861},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","cascade control","collision avoidance","decentralised control","mobile robots","position control","predictive control","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV collision avoidance","cooperative predictive control","decentralized cooperative control","unmanned aerial vehicles","trajectory control unit","autopilot unit","vehicle stability","cascade control structure","obstacle avoidance","static obstacles","vehicle trajectory"]}],"abstract":"This article describes the use of predictive control for the decentralized cooperative control of unmanned aerial vehicles in an unfamiliar three-dimensional environment. It is assumed that each vehicle is equipped with an autopilot and a trajectory control unit. The autopilot insures the stability of the vehicle. The setpoints of the autopilot are calculated by the trajectory control unit, thus forming a cascade control structure. The trajectory control unit relies on a predictive control algorithm to calculate the optimal commands (autopilot setpoints) such that the vehicle will reach fixed targets at known positions while avoiding static obstacles that are detected en route. The advantage in using predictive control is that it offers great flexibility in the objective function to optimize while respecting constraints such as command limits, limits on the displacement that a vehicle can carry out, and the constraints that allow obstacle avoidance. The principle proposed in order to avoid static obstacles (that are assumed ellipsoid) is to verify that the predicted vehicle trajectory does not intersect these obstacles. With the objective to increase performance, cooperation between vehicles must also be privileged. Thus, if some vehicles are within the communication range, they can share the position and shape of the obstacles they have detected. Simulations illustrate the method and higlight the benefits of cooperation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UAV collision avoidance using cooperative predictive control","publicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/MED.2008.4602109","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588253/4601965/04602109.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2008.4602109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"UAV collision avoidance using cooperative predictive control","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602109/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10160015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UAV collision avoidance using cooperative predictive control","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"0229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051882S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588253","isNumber":"4601965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588253","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4601965","articleId":"4602109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4602112,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292022100"},{"name":"Georgios Georgoulas","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Georgoulas","id":"37297084100"},{"name":"Marcos Orchard","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Orchard","id":"37302374800"},{"name":"Abhinav Saxena","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37287158500"},{"name":"Douglas Brown","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Brown","id":"37401863200"},{"name":"George Vachtsevanos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Vachtsevanos","id":"37268243000"},{"name":"Steven Liang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Liang","id":"37416941200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2504-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2505-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4602112","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":704},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","rolling bearings","structural engineering computing","vibration control","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rolling element bearing","feature extraction","anomaly detection","vibration monitoring","bearing fault modes","k-nearest neighbor","particle filter"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an anomaly detection structure, in which different types of anomaly detection routines can be applied, is proposed.

For this purpose, a modified growing and pruning algorithm for radial basis function (MGAP-RBF) neural network is used for affine modeling of the SISO nonlinear and time-varying processes. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is utilized as an effective learning algorithm for parameter adaptation in the GAP-RBF neural network. The performances of the modified GAP-RBF and the original GAP-RBF are evaluated on a non-affine CSTR benchmark problem with nonlinear and time-varying behavior. Simulation results show good performance of the MGAP-RBF neural network for identification of an exact affine model for the CSTR.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2008.4602154","startPage":"735","endPage":"740","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588253/4601965/04602154.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2008.4602154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new on-line identification approach for affine modeling of nonlinear processes using an adaptive neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","identification","Kalman filters","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online identification approach","affine modeling","adaptive neural network","single-input single-output process","time-varying behaviors","nonlinear behaviors","radial basis function","extended Kalman filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new on-line identification approach for affine modeling of nonlinear processes using an adaptive neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602154/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10158809","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new on-line identification approach for affine modeling of nonlinear processes using an adaptive neural network","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"0293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042774S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588253","isNumber":"4601965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588253","xplore-issue":"4601965","articleId":"4602154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4602164,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Labiod","affiliation":["LAMEL, Faculty of Engineering, University of Jijel, Algeria"],"firstName":"Salim","lastName":"Labiod","id":"37564409900"},{"name":"Thierry Marie Guerra","affiliation":["Universite de Valenciennes et du Hainaut-Cambresis, Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Thierry Marie","lastName":"Guerra","id":"37266448400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2504-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2505-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4602164","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","multivariable control systems","nonlinear systems","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct adaptive fuzzy control","nonlinear systems","input amplitude constraint","rate saturation constraint","uncertain systems","single-input single-output systems","controller design","closed-loop system stability","Lyapunov analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602164","abstract":"This paper presents a direct adaptive fuzzy control scheme for a class of uncertain single-input single-output nonlinear systems subject to input amplitude and rate saturation constraints.

The key to extract strong features that characterize the complex nature of voice signals is to identify their discriminatory subspaces. Diagnosis of pathological voice is one of the most important issues in biomedical applications of speech technology. There are some approaches for separating pathological from normal voice signals but a few ones are sophisticated to separate two or more kinds of speech pathologies from each other. This paper introduces an algorithm to discriminate voice pathologies signals from each other via adaptive growth of Wavelet Packet tree, based on the criterion of local discriminant bases (LDB). Two dissimilarity measures were used in the process of selecting the LDB nodes and extracting features from them. Moreover, Genetic Algorithm is employed for selecting the best feature set and Support Vector Machines as classifier to obtain as much as possible better results. To evaluate the proposed approach, we apply our algorithm to separate paralysis, paresis, and nodule from each other. Experimental results show the superior performance of this combinational approach against its incomplete versions (e.g. in the case of separating paresis and nodule, the proposed approach leads to 100% performance against 94.44% for where only complete wavelet packet features without applying LDB algorithm are used).","doi":"10.1109/MED.2008.4602260","startPage":"872","endPage":"876","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588253/4601965/04602260.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2008.4602260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pathological voice classifcation using local discriminant basis and genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","genetic algorithms","speech processing","support vector machines","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pathological voice classification","local discriminant basis","genetic algorithm","voice feature extraction","voice content","speech pathologies","wavelet packet tree","support vector machines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet packet","Linear discriminant bases","Genetic algorithm","Support vector machines","Pathological voice","Vocal paralysis","Vocal paresis","Vocal nodules"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Pathological voice classifcation using local discriminant basis and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602260/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10159896","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pathological voice classifcation using local discriminant basis and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"0466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137979S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588253","isNumber":"4601965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588253","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4601965","articleId":"4602260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4602339,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To reduce training procedure time, K-means clustering algorithm is applied to dataset. Since the discrimination method is done with probabilistic characteristics of signals without application of any deterministic index, more reliable and accurate classification is achieved. Based on the proposed algorithm a high speed differential relaying could be performed in about half of a cycle. The suitable performance of this method is demonstrated by simulation of different fault types and switching conditions on a power transformer. All simulation results validate the proposed scheme accuracy. It provides a high operating sensitivity for internal faults and remains stable for inrush currents of the power transformers.","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602363","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594620/4602282/04602363.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new stochastic method based on Hidden Markov Models to transformer differential protection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602363/","displayDocTitle":"A new stochastic method based on Hidden Markov Models to transformer differential protection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10146037","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602363/","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new stochastic method based on Hidden Markov Models to transformer differential protection","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"1F09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0818S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4602366,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

In this paper a new approach will be used for optimal coordination of OC relays based on genetic algorithm. In this work we take into account both time setting multiplier (TSM) and plug setting multiplier (PSM) of OC relays in optimization procedure. Most OC relays accept only discrete values as TSM and PSM, and you should change your final answers to discrete form and this may corrupt the optimization. In this paper the act of quantizing the answers is taken into account as a part of optimization procedure, so the outputs are optimized discrete TSM\u2019s and PSM\u2019s. In other words the novelty of the paper is taking into account the PSM in addition to TSM to handle miscoordination problems both for continues and discrete TSM and PSM. The results obtained are quite encouraging and will be useful as an effective tool for coordination OC relays.","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602366","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594620/4602282/04602366.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Overcurrent relays coordination using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Overcurrent relays coordination using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10146040","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4602366/","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Overcurrent relays coordination using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"1F12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077049S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":4602372,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Since universal motors can not meet the ever-growing standards of electrical equipment design, new generations of electric machines compete to conquer this market. For industrial applications and home appliances, PMSMs seem to be the most fitted solution, especially at high speed operation. In this paper, a 25 kW, 15 krpm, 6/4 PMSM is presented and analyzed via FEM, as a cost effective solution. Optimal design through Hooke-Jeeves method is; presented. The problem of cogging torque reduction is discussed and several techniques are used to reduce total torque pulsations. Results obtained via FEM are analyzed, in order to apply the best technique for our case, without compromising design requirements, low manufacturing costs and high efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594620/4602282/04602374.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"256","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602282","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"25 kW, 15 krpm, 6/4 PMSM: Optimal design and torque pulsation reduction via FEM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Rotors","Stators","Stator windings","Stator cores","Forging","Coils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PMSM optimal design","permanent magnet synchronous motor","torque pulsation reduction","FEM","finite element method","electrical equipment design","industrial applications","home appliances","Hooke-Jeeves method","power 25 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"25 kW, 15 krpm, 6/4 PMSM: Optimal design and torque pulsation reduction via FEM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602374/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10146045","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"25 kW, 15 krpm, 6/4 PMSM: Optimal design and torque pulsation reduction via FEM","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"1H02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061313S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4602379,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Optimal value of the induction heating resonance capacitor is achieved by used genetic algorithm under voltage constraint for maximizing the output power of an induction heater, while minimizing the power loss of the capacitor and inverter switching frequency at the same time. Based on the equivalent circuit model of an induction heating system, the output power, and the capacitor losses are calculated.

The suitable control scheme for this type of converter necessitates equal voltage sharing for input- series connected modules and output current sharing for the output-parallel connected modules for all operating conditions even with existence of dissimilarity in devices and components used in each module. Such control scheme consisting of several controllers can be implemented using analog controllers. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) which optimizes the parameters of analog controllers for each control loop in the control scheme of an ISOP connected converter. Using GA eliminates the need for tedious and time consuming small signal analysis of multi- module converters. Moreover, because GA chooses the best value for each parameters in different control loops simultaneously it can best consider the interaction among all loops and results in better large signal performance especially in the case of large variations in the parameters or considerable difference among modules of converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602454/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10145936","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602454/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved large signal performance of linear controlled input-series and output-parallel dc-dc converter using genetic algorithm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved large signal performance of linear controlled input-series and output-parallel dc-dc converter using genetic algorithm optimization","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"3A05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084143S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4602457,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The system consists of two major components: a PC application and a hardware component controlled by an FPGA device. The role of the system implemented in the FPGA device is to acquire and process data related to the DC motor's operation, to control the motor's voltage and to exchange data with the PC application. The PC application provides to the user an interface for visualizing information related to the motor's operation and for interacting with the system. It implements speed and position controllers based on PID algorithm and artificial neural networks, and provides multiple auto-tuning methods for automatic evaluation of the PID controllers parameters and also training sets for the neural network controller. The main advantage of the system is that it allows to automatically determine the control parameters for different DC motors without any prior knowledge regarding the motor parameters, and to easily verify the performances of the controllers.","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602474","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594620/4602282/04602474.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network and PID based control system for DC motor drives","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC motor drives","neural nets","permanent magnet motors","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","PID based control system","DC motor drives","permanent magnet motors","PID controllers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network and PID based control system for DC motor drives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602474/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10145956","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network and PID based control system for DC motor drives","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"3E04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083321S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4602475,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmood Joorabian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Joorabian","id":"37371595400"},{"name":"Morteza Razzaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran"],"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Razzaz","id":"37697957700"},{"name":"Mazdak Ebadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mazdak","lastName":"Ebadi","id":"37697956900"},{"name":"Mahmood Moghaddasian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Moghaddasian","id":"37658364600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1544-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1545-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4602475","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"abstract":"Power system oscillation damping, have always been an undeniable problem for engineers. In this paper we try to show that a supplementary lead-lag controller using wide area signals can greatly decrease the oscillations, because the global signals involve more wide-area oscillation modes. Parameters of this damping lead-lag controller are obtained by phase compensation method. Then an artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented to calculate the damping controller's gain. To validate the proposed controller, computer simulation using MATLAB/ SIMULINK is performed on a 2-area, 4- machine test system. The results show that using a well-trained ANN in proposed method, can clearly improve the damping of sub-synchronous oscillations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Oscillators","Generators","Static VAr compensators","Artificial neural networks","Indexes","Admittance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurocontrollers","oscillations","power system control","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subsynchronous oscillations damping","power system oscillation damping","damping lead-lag controller","phase compensation method","artificial neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANN","synthetic residue index","sub-synchronous oscillations","supplementary controller","SVC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602475","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594620/4602282/04602475.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping sub-synchronous oscillations of power system using ANN-based controlled SVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Damping sub-synchronous oscillations of power system using ANN-based controlled SVC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602475/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602475/","accessionNumber":"10145957","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping sub-synchronous oscillations of power system using ANN-based controlled SVC","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"3E05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049167S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4602490,"authors":[{"name":"Cs.

To achieve this, we have introduced the fake register insertion method and combined it with retiming method. Fake registers have been inserted on low-transition wires around high-transition wires to force the synthesis tool to direct those low-transition wires on LUTs' outputs. In other words, high-transition wires will be likely placed inside LUT blocks and consequently, the off-block switching activity among LUT blocks gets reduced. Retiming is used to move registers that have been located on high-transition wires in order to prevent the synthesis tool to place them on LUTs' outputs. As of benchmarking, two of ISCAS89 benchmark library circuits were employed. Experimental results have shown that this scheme will decrease the off-block switching of the implemented circuits up to 25%.","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594620/4602282/04602495.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power optimization of LUT based FPGA circuits","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power optimization of LUT based FPGA circuits","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10145977","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4602495/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power optimization of LUT based FPGA circuits","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"4B02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068171S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4602496,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.

This is used then to implement a neural network on a FPGA platform, yielding a high degree of parallelism. In the first section of this paper the biological background of spiking neural networks are discussed such as the structure and the functionality of natural neurons which form the basis of the further presented, artificially built ones. With a clustering application in mind, we prove, that input patterns can be encoded in the synaptic weights by local Hebbian delay-learning where, after learning, the firing time of an output neuron reflects the distance of the evaluated pattern to its learned input pattern thus realizing a kind of RBF neuron. Further in the paper, we show that temporal spike-time coding and Hebbian learning is a viable means for unsupervised computation in a network of spiking neurons, as the network is capable of clustering realistic data. The modular neuron structure, the multiplier- less, fully parallel FPGA hardware implementation of the network, the acquired signals during and after the learning phase are given, with the proper interpretation of the results compared to other reported results in the specific literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594620/4602282/04602498.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602282","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of delay-coded spiking-RBF neural network for unsupervised clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Delay","Encoding","Computational modeling","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","neural chips","pattern clustering","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-coded spiking-RBF neural network","unsupervised clustering","spiking neurons","sparse temporal coding","Hebbian delay-learning","temporal spike-time coding","parallel FPGA hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of delay-coded spiking-RBF neural network for unsupervised clustering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602498/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10145980","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of delay-coded spiking-RBF neural network for unsupervised clustering","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"4B05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108226S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594620","isNumber":"4602282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594620","xplore-issue":"4602282","articleId":"4602498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4602531,"authors":[{"name":"Sirikiat Lek Ariyavisitakul","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Duluth, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sirikiat Lek","lastName":"Ariyavisitakul","id":"37349391000"},{"name":"Jun Zheng","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37290251000"},{"name":"Eric Ojard","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Ojard","id":"37698274000"},{"name":"Joonsuk Kim","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joonsuk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37657365000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4602531","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":537},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Silicon carbide","Channel capacity","Maximum likelihood detection","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Decoding","Delay","Singular value decomposition","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","decoding","information theory","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-capacity MIMO","subspace beamforming","multiple-input multiple-output channel","channel capacity","geometric mean decomposition","maximum-likelihood detection","optimization","Shannon bound","decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Geometric mean decomposition (GMD)","maximum likelihood (ML)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","singular value decomposition (SVD)","subspace"]},{"kwd":["MIMO","SVD","GMD","subspace","maximum likelihood"]}],"abstract":"A subspace beamforming method is presented that decomposes a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel into multiple pairs of subchannels.

Rather than considering traditional large sample-size asymptotics, in this paper the focus is on limited sample size situations, whereby the number of available observations is comparable in magnitude to the observation dimension. Using tools from random matrix theory, the asymptotic behavior of the traditional sample estimates is investigated under the assumption that both the sample size and the observation dimension tend to infinity, while their quotient converges to a positive quantity. Assuming that an asymptotic eigenvalue splitting condition is fulfilled, closed form asymptotic expressions of these estimators are derived, proving inconsistency of the traditional sample estimators in these asymptotic conditions.

Specifically, the minimization of the Euclidean distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence leads, respectively, to the Euclidean correlation matching (ECM) and Kullback correlation matching (KCM) criteria. The proposed techniques exploit the knowledge of the source correlation matrix to unambiguously recover the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. Furthermore, due to the orthogonality properties of OSTBCs, both the ECM and KCM criteria result in closed form solutions. In particular, the channel estimate is given by the principal eigenvector of a matrix, which is obtained from the estimated correlation matrix of the observations modified by the code matrices and a set of weights. In the ECM case, the weights are fixed and equal to the eigenvalues of the source correlation matrix, whereas the KCM weights depend on both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the source eigenvalues. Additionally, we show that the proposed approaches are equivalent in the low SNR regime, whereas in the high SNR regime the KCM criterion is asymptotically equivalent to the relaxed blind maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder.

One example is the differential Doppler (DD) method in which the signal of a stationary emitter is intercepted by at least two moving receivers. The frequency difference between the receivers is measured at several locations along their trajectories and the emitter's position is then estimated based on these measurements. This two-step approach is suboptimal since each frequency difference measurement is performed independently, although all measurements correspond to a common emitter position. Instead, a single-step approach based on the maximum likelihood criterion is proposed here for both known and unknown waveforms. The position is determined directly from all the observations by a search in the position space. The method can only be used for narrowband signals, that is, under the assumption that the signal bandwidth must be small compared to the inverse of the propagation time between the receivers. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the DD method for weak signals while both methods converge to the Cramer-Rao bound for strong known signals. Finally, it is shown that in some cases of interest the proposed method inherently selects reliable observations while ignoring unreliable data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10265474","htmlLink":"/document/4602539/","displayDocTitle":"Localization of Narrowband Radio Emitters Based on Doppler Frequency Shifts","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of Narrowband Radio Emitters Based on Doppler Frequency Shifts","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-amar2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082215S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4652320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"4652320","articleId":"4602539","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4602540,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yang Chen","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4668621/4602540/4602540-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Yang Chen (S'06) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

Unlike the traditional single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar which emits coherent waveforms to form a focused beam, the MIMO radar can transmit orthogonal (or incoherent) waveforms. These waveforms can be used to increase the system spatial resolution. The waveforms also affect the range and Doppler resolution. In traditional (SIMO) radars, the ambiguity function of the transmitted pulse characterizes the compromise between range and Doppler resolutions. It is a major tool for studying and analyzing radar signals. Recently, the idea of ambiguity function has been extended to the case of MIMO radar. In this paper, some mathematical properties of the MIMO radar ambiguity function are first derived. These properties provide some insights into the MIMO radar waveform design. Then a new algorithm for designing the orthogonal frequency-hopping waveforms is proposed. This algorithm reduces the sidelobes in the corresponding MIMO radar ambiguity function and makes the energy of the ambiguity function spread evenly in the range and angular dimensions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radar Ambiguity Properties and Optimization Using Frequency-Hopping Waveforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.929658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04602540.pdf","startPage":"5926","endPage":"5936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.929658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602540/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radar Ambiguity Properties and Optimization Using Frequency-Hopping Waveforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4602540/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313312","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radar Ambiguity Properties and Optimization Using Frequency-Hopping Waveforms","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-chen-929658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070146S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4602540","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4602542,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Although dirty-paper coding (DPC) is capacity achieving for this channel, employing dirty-paper coding is a computationally complex non-convex problem. To deal with this problem, many algorithms use iterative procedures to find the optimal solution. However, when the number of active users is large, these algorithms introduce a high order of complexity and suffer from memory drawback. Best Group (BG) selection is a method to address this problem. We propose a new BG selection algorithm that when is used jointly with the iterative dirty paper coding algorithm, provides acceptable results. The main feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is more efficient in a sense of computationally complexity than the similar algorithms. In addition as our simulation results show the proposed algorithm not only is much faster than similar algorithms, but also, it has very negligible reduction in the BC capacity.","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602553","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595630/4602546/04602553.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602553","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","startPage":"425","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Best Group selection algorithm to maximize capacity of MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Best Group selection algorithm to maximize capacity of MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602553/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602553/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176690","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Best Group selection algorithm to maximize capacity of MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels","confLoc":"Novosibirsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"A Best Group Selection Algorithm to Maximize Capacity of MIM.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044164S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595630","isNumber":"4602546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595630","xplore-issue":"4602546","articleId":"4602553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4602556,"authors":[{"name":"Mousa Yousefi","affiliation":["Ilkhchy branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mousa","lastName":"Yousefi","id":"37571160500"},{"name":"Ziaaddin Daie KoozeKanani","affiliation":["Ilkhchy branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Ziaaddin Daie","lastName":"KoozeKanani","id":"37063358300"},{"name":"Ali Rostami","affiliation":["Ilkhchy branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Rostami","id":"37086222200"},{"name":"Jafar Sobhi","affiliation":["Ilkhchy branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Sobhi","id":"37443495800"},{"name":"Mohammad Hossein Zarifi","affiliation":["Ilkhchy branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hossein","lastName":"Zarifi","id":"37570340300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2133-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2134-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4602556","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Gain","Converters","Arrays","Clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","data acquisition","sample and hold circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample and hold circuit","data converter","flexible structure","analog to digital converter","CMOS technology","sampling rate","size 0.35 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602556","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602546","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595630/4602546/04602556.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible sample and hold circuit for data converter applications","abstract":"The sample and hold circuit is perhaps the most important building block in most data acquisition systems such as data converter.

The real time interference cancellation performance of an indoor repeater depends on its computational complexity. In order to reduce the complexity of interference cancellation repeaters, computationally efficient interpolated filters are used as an input filter for frequency band selection and an output filter for spectrum mask control. Interpolation is applied to the implementation of an adaptive filter that performs interference cancellation under indoor channel environments. This allows the adaptive filter to calculate fewer filter taps and only uses them to estimate the feedback signal. For additional complexity reduction, a single common image rejection filter is designed to be shared among interpolated filters. The proposed scheme reduces the complexity of the conventional interference can cellation repeater by half without deterioration of the interference cancellation performance of the repeater.","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602558","startPage":"457","endPage":"462","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602546","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595630/4602546/04602558.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new low-complex interference cancellation scheme for WCDMA indoor repeaters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602558/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new low-complex interference cancellation scheme for WCDMA indoor repeaters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602558/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10176695","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new low-complex interference cancellation scheme for WCDMA indoor repeaters","confLoc":"Novosibirsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"A New Low-Complex Interference Cancellation Scheme for WCDMA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135995S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595630","isNumber":"4602546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595630","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4602546","articleId":"4602558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4602559,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Liu","affiliation":["College of Optical and Electrical Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280621800"},{"name":"Shengnan Liu","affiliation":["College of Optical and Electrical Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Shengnan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37696143900"},{"name":"Hua-An Zhao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hua-An","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37276548600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2133-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2134-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4602559","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Construction industry","Block codes","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","block codes","diversity reception","MIMO communication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time block code","full diversity MIMO systems","ABCD code","Alamouti code","algebraic code","second-order mutual information"]}],"abstract":"A new space-time block code, named ABCD code, is presented in this paper.

However, in the case of LDPC codes (low-density parity-check) such a constructed code is generally not well suited for a hardware implementation. It has been recognized that the code construction and hardware design must be considered jointly to facilitate LDPC decoder and encoder implementation. In this paper, an efficient decoder structure for regular and irregular LDPC codes, based on TDMP (turbo-decoding message passing) scheme is designed first. The decoder has been implemented and verified in an FPGA device. Constraints for the parity check matrix of a code to be suitable for the decoder architecture are defined. Then an algorithm for LDPC parity check matrix construction subject to these constraints is presented. The algorithm aims at improving performance of the code in the low SNR region by employing irregular codes as well as in high SNR region by reducing the number of small Stopping Sets and Trapping Sets in the Tanner graph of the code making use of a computer search technique.","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602573","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595630/4602546/04602573.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code construction algorithm for architecture aware LDPC codes with low-error-floor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602573/","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Code construction algorithm for architecture aware LDPC codes with low-error-floor","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10176710","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4602573/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code construction algorithm for architecture aware LDPC codes with low-error-floor","confLoc":"Novosibirsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"Code Construction Algorithm for Architecture Aware LDPC Code.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086849S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595630","isNumber":"4602546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595630","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4602546","articleId":"4602573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4602579,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Sh.

It introduces preliminary results of the Filed Programming Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of solar model. FPGA technology was employed due to its development flexibility and low cost. A database comprising a set of meteorological data such as: solar radiation, temperature and sunshine duration have been used in this study. The inputs of the ANN-solar model are the sunshine duration and mean average temperature while the output is the daily total solar radiation. Firstly, a dataset of several sites have been used for training the network. Subsequently, after the design procedure was done, the developed architecture by VHDL is then implemented on reconfigurable FPGA device (Xilinx, VirtexII). The developed hardware device permits the forecasting of the daily solar radiation using available mean temperature and sunshine duration, especially in isolated sites, where there are no instruments for measuring the solar radiation data.","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602597","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595630/4602546/04602597.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based artificial neural network for prediction of solar radiation data from sunshine duration and air temperature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602597/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based artificial neural network for prediction of solar radiation data from sunshine duration and air temperature","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10176734","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602597/","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based artificial neural network for prediction of solar radiation data from sunshine duration and air temperature","confLoc":"Novosibirsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"FPGA-Based Artificial Neural Network for Prediction of Solar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068832S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595630","isNumber":"4602546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595630","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4602546","articleId":"4602597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4602603,"authors":[{"name":"P.

By transferring loads from the heavily loaded feeders to the relatively lightly loaded feeders, the network reconfiguration can balance feeder loads and eliminate overload conditions. The system load-balancing index (LBI) is used to determine the loading conditions of the system and maximum system loading capacity. The index value has to be minimum in the optimal network reconfiguration of load balancing. This paper presents a new approach for optimal network reconfiguration of a distribution system using genetic algorithm to determine the optimal network reconfiguration. The switches are taken into consideration for crossover process. After obtaining number of solutions from the combinational analysis, the optimal solution is selected based on the fitness function, i.e., the solution having the minimum index value. The proposed approach is tested on IEEE 16 bus system.","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602603","startPage":"124","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2008.4602603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4602546","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595630/4602546/04602603.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of genetic algorithm for optimal network reconfiguration in distribution systems for load balancing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602603/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of genetic algorithm for optimal network reconfiguration in distribution systems for load balancing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602603/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10176740","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of genetic algorithm for optimal network reconfiguration in distribution systems for load balancing","confLoc":"Novosibirsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"Implementation of Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Network Reco.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051728S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595630","isNumber":"4602546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595630","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4602546","articleId":"4602603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4602619,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For wearable applications, a semidirectional radiation pattern of the wearable patch antenna is preferred over an omnidirectional radiation of conventional dipole antennas to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure to the human body and radiation losses. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the antennas is not constrained as a typical handheld unit. Through theoretical modeling and simulation, the wearable MIMO system is shown to demonstrate a significantly higher channel capacity than a conventional system on a handheld platform (e.g., a compact dipole array or a single dipole), due to enhanced spatial diversity and antenna pattern diversity. The unique effects of antenna directivity and location on the MIMO system capacity are investigated in terms of antenna correlation and effective gain under different wireless channel models. The advantage of a wearable system over a conventional system was further confirmed by detailed physical modeling through the combination of full-wave electromagnetic and ray-tracing simulations. Finally, complex channel response matrices were measured to characterize the performance of a body-worn MIMO system in comparison with a reference full-size dipole antenna. The 319% improvement in 10% outage capacity for the body-worn system over the reference system made of a full-size dipole antenna is consistent with the 288% improvement projected by theoretical modeling and the average 300% improvement found in the physical simulation of two typical indoor scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2004491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4897220/04602693.pdf","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2004491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Body-Worn Distributed MIMO System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602693/","displayDocTitle":"Body-Worn Distributed MIMO System","volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601641","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602693/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Body-Worn Distributed MIMO System","sourcePdf":"tvt-ouyang-2004491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098705S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4897220","articleId":"4602693","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4602695,"authors":[{"name":"Bimal K.

A reference generator, designed to improve vehicle handling, provides the desired yaw rate value to be achieved by the closed loop controller. The latter is designed using the second-order sliding mode (SOSM) methodology to guarantee robust stability in front of disturbances and model uncertainties, which are typical of the automotive context. A feedforward control contribution is also employed to enhance the transient system response. The control derivative is constructed as a discontinuous signal, attaining an SOSM on a suitably selected sliding manifold. Thus, the actual control input results in being continuous, as it is needed in the considered context. Simulations performed using a realistic nonlinear model of the considered vehicle show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4663160/04602704.pdf","startPage":"3908","endPage":"3916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2003200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2003200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Yaw Control via Second-Order Sliding-Mode Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sliding mode control","Robust control","Irrigation","Robust stability","Uncertainty","Control systems","Actuators","Vehicle safety","Road safety","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","feedforward","road vehicles","robust control","transient response","uncertain systems","variable structure systems","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle yaw control","second-order sliding-mode technique","yaw rate feedback","reference generator","closed loop controller","robust stability","uncertain system","transient system response","feedforward control design","active differential"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chattering avoidance","higher order sliding modes","robust control","vehicle yaw control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Yaw Control via Second-Order Sliding-Mode Technique","volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4602704/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301398","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Yaw Control via Second-Order Sliding-Mode Technique","sourcePdf":"tie-vecchio-2003200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064216S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4663160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"4663160","articleId":"4602704","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4602706,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Aschemann","affiliation":["The Chair of Mechatronics, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4663160/4602706/4602706-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Harald Aschemann received the Diploma degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Hanover, Hanover, Germany, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany, in 2001, focusing on optimal trajectory planning and trajectory control of an overhead traveling crane.","After two years in research and development with a leading machine tools company, where he worked on automated transfer systems, he was with the Department of Measurement, Control, and Microtechnology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

Its guided carriage is driven by a nonlinear mechanism consisting of a rocker with an antagonistic pair of pneumatic muscle actuators arranged at both sides. This innovative drive concept allows for both an increased workspace of approximately 1 m as well as higher carriage velocities of approximately 1.3 m/s as compared to a direct actuation. Modeling of the muscle-driven positioning system leads to a system of four nonlinear differential equations including polynomial approximations of the volume characteristic as well as the force characteristic of the pneumatic muscles. The differential flatness of the system is exploited in combination with SM techniques to stabilize the error dynamics in view of unmodeled dynamics. The internal pressure of each pneumatic muscle is controlled by a fast underlying control loop. Hence, the control design for the outer control loop can be simplified by considering these controlled muscle pressures as ideal control inputs. The control design of the outer control loop involves a decoupling of rocker angle as well as mean internal pressure of both pneumatic muscles as flat outputs. Additionally, model uncertainties in the equation of motion like nonlinear friction are directly counteracted by an observer-based disturbance compensation which reduces the chattering problem. Experimental results show an excellent control performance that outperforms alternative control approaches in a comparison.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2003202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4663160/04602706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2003202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663160","startPage":"3855","endPage":"3864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding-Mode Control of a High-Speed Linear Axis Driven by Pneumatic Muscle Actuators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sliding-Mode Control of a High-Speed Linear Axis Driven by Pneumatic Muscle Actuators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10291063","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4602706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding-Mode Control of a High-Speed Linear Axis Driven by Pneumatic Muscle Actuators","sourcePdf":"tie-aschemann-2003202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080888S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4663160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4663160","articleId":"4602706","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4602707,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Chin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291802400"},{"name":"Jen Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37311438700"},{"name":"Teng-Chun Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Teng-Chun","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37691951200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4602707","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Decoding","Multiple access interference","Space power stations","WDM networks","Chaos","Interference elimination","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical fibre communication","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differentiated service provision","optical CDMA","power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differentiated service","optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA)","power control"]}],"abstract":"A simple scheme to use power control for differentiated service provision is proposed for the optical code-division multiple-access network.

A solution to tackle this problem is to use stator current for a condition monitoring, referred to as motor current signature analysis. This paper argues that bearing faults would have a negligible effect on motor currents and instead argues that the more likely reason why the faults can be detected in currents is because they entail a fluctuating resistive torque which acts immediately, in contrast to the radial displacement which takes time to integrate to a perceptible displacement even in response to a step change in velocity.

As regards rotor faults, the diagnostic procedure based on sideband current components may fail due to the presence of interbar currents that reduce the degree of rotor asymmetry and, thus, the amplitude of these spectral components. On the other hand, the interbar currents produce core vibrations in the axial direction; these vibrations can be detected using a suitable vibration sensor. In this paper, a differential fault analysis based on traditional motor current signature analysis (MCSA) and on radial and axial vibration monitoring is proposed to discern cases in which the presence of interbar currents decreases the sensitivity of MCSA. The features of stator currents and of radial and axial core vibration signals are investigated in order to increase the reliability of the diagnostic system. Moreover, to explore the possibility of obtaining further information, stray flux signals are taken into account.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2003212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04602715.pdf","startPage":"4156","endPage":"4166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2003212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Diagnosis Based on Multivariable Monitoring to Assess Induction Machine Rotor Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602715/","displayDocTitle":"Differential Diagnosis Based on Multivariable Monitoring to Assess Induction Machine Rotor Conditions","volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348764","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602715/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Diagnosis Based on Multivariable Monitoring to Assess Induction Machine Rotor Conditions","sourcePdf":"tie-concari-2003212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095808S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4602715","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4602716,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 I.

Without studying the relationship between the radial suspension force and radial displacement, the traditional control method for rotor radial displacement has some drawbacks such as the complexity of computation and time-consuming tuning. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a novel approach to control the rotor radial displacement was proposed based on the relationship between the radial displacement and radial suspension force. The rotor flux orientation is adopted to decouple the electromagnetic torque and radial suspension force. This approach directly controls the rotor radial displacement of bearingless permanent-magnet-type synchronous motors. In addition, a control system was designed by applying this approach. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in realizing stable operation in rotor radial position control.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2003219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4771829/04602719.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2003219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Control of Radial Displacement for Bearingless Permanent-Magnet-Type Synchronous Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Direct Control of Radial Displacement for Bearingless Permanent-Magnet-Type Synchronous Motors","volume":"56","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10429193","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4602719/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Control of Radial Displacement for Bearingless Permanent-Magnet-Type Synchronous Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-luo-2003219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074185S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4771829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4771829","articleId":"4602719","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4602720,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan M.

The DWIG consists of a standard squirrel-cage rotor and a stator with two separate windings wound for the same number of poles. This generator has a diode bridge rectifier load connected across to the power winding and a static excitation controller (SEC) to the control winding. Investigations into the reactive power released by the fixed excitation capacitor bank versus rotor speed under various loads represent that the minimal capacity of SEC can be achieved by an appropriate selection of excitation capacitor bank. With the help of instantaneous power theory, the control mechanism for the DWIG system working with a variable rotor speed is analyzed. Moreover, the system control strategy which is fit for the wide-speed-range operation using the stator flux orientation is consequently proposed. An 18-kW DWIG system with a 270-V high voltage DC output is developed. The simulation and experimental results illustrate a desirable performance, and the compact implementation of SEC is obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Capacity Optimization for the Static Excitation Controller of the Dual-Stator-Winding Induction Generator Operating in a Wide Speed Range","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2003363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4771829/04602721.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2003363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"The Capacity Optimization for the Static Excitation Controller of the Dual-Stator-Winding Induction Generator Operating in a Wide Speed Range","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4602721/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10429194","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Capacity Optimization for the Static Excitation Controller of the Dual-Stator-Winding Induction Generator Operating in a Wide Speed Range","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2003363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072399S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4771829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4771829","articleId":"4602721","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4602722,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00c9rgio M.

By measuring the oscillations at twice the slip frequency found in the rotor flux of the machine, and by conjugating this information with the knowledge of some motor parameters, as well as the parameters of the flux and current controllers, it is possible to generate a virtual magnetizing current which, after normalization, allows the detection and quantification of the extension of the fault. The proposed method allows one to overcome the major difficulties usually found in the diagnosis of rotor faults in closed-loop drives by providing information about the condition of the machine in a way that is independent of the working conditions of the drive such as the load level, reference speed, and bandwidth of the control loops. Although the VCT was primarily developed for traction drives used in railway applications, it can be incorporated in any DRFOC drive at almost no additional cost. Several simulation results, obtained with different types of DRFOC drives, as well as experimental results obtained in the laboratory, demonstrate the effectiveness of this new diagnostic approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2003365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04602722.pdf","startPage":"4218","endPage":"4228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2003365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Model-Based Technique for the Diagnosis of Rotor Faults in RFOC Induction Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4602722/","displayDocTitle":"A New Model-Based Technique for the Diagnosis of Rotor Faults in RFOC Induction Motor Drives","volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348766","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4602722/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Model-Based Technique for the Diagnosis of Rotor Faults in RFOC Induction Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-cruz-2003365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095273S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4602722","onlineDate":"19 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4602723,"authors":[{"name":"Xing-Gang Yan","affiliation":["Control Systems Research Group, Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Xing-Gang","lastName":"Yan","id":"38546603600"},{"name":"Christopher Edwards","affiliation":["Control Systems Research Group, Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Edwards","id":"37271760900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"4602723","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1526},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4602723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sliding-Mode-Observer-Based Fault Reconstruction for Nonlinear Systems With Parametric Uncertainties","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> In this paper, a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters is considered.

Based on binary trees, the MP-tree is very efficient, effective, and flexible for handling macro placements with various constraints. Given a global placement that already considers the areas and the interconnections among standard cells and macros, our MP-tree-based macro placer optimizes macro positions, minimizes the macro displacement from the initial macro positions, and maximizes the area of the chip center for standard-cell placement and routing. Experiments based on the Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Physical Design placement contest benchmarks and Faraday benchmarks show that our macro placer combined with APlace 2.0, Capo 10.2, mPL6, or NTUplace3 for a standard-cell placement outperforms these state-of-the-art academic mixed-size placers alone by large margins in robustness and quality. In addition to wirelength, experiments on four real industrial designs with large macros and high utilization rates show that our method significantly reduces the average half-perimeter wirelength by 35 %, the average routed wirelength by 55 %, and the routing overflows by 13 times compared with Capo 10.2, implying that our macro placer leads to much higher routability.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.927760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4603069/04603071.pdf","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.927760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MP-Trees: A Packing-Based Macro Placement Algorithm for Modern Mixed-Size Designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"MP-Trees: A Packing-Based Macro Placement Algorithm for Modern Mixed-Size Designs","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4603071/","accessionNumber":"10177385","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MP-Trees: A Packing-Based Macro Placement Algorithm for Modern Mixed-Size Designs","sourcePdf":"27tcad09-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100186S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4603069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4603069","articleId":"4603071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4603076,"authors":[{"name":"Aijiao Cui","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4603069/4603076/4603076-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aijiao Cui (S'06) received the B.Eng. degree and the M.

The headroom of each disjoint closed cone is evaluated based on its slack and slack sustainability. The notion of slack sustainability in conjunction with an embedding threshold enables closed cones in the critical path to be qualified as watermark hosts if their slacks can be better preserved upon remapping. The watermark is embedded by remapping only qualified disjoint closed cones randomly selected and templates constrained by the signature. This parametric formulation provides a means to capitalize on the headroom of a design to increase the signature length or strengthen the watermark resilience. With the master design, the watermarked design can be authenticated as in nonoblivious media watermarking. Experimental results show that the design can be efficiently marked by our method with low overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.927732","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4603069/04603076.pdf","startPage":"1565","endPage":"1570","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.927732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP Watermarking Using Incremental Technology Mapping at Logic Synthesis Level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"IP Watermarking Using Incremental Technology Mapping at Logic Synthesis Level","volume":"27","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10177389","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4603076/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP Watermarking Using Incremental Technology Mapping at Logic Synthesis Level","sourcePdf":"27tcad09-cui.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081565S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4603069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4603069","articleId":"4603076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4603088,"authors":[{"name":"Hiran Tennakoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Nanometer Design Laboratory, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4603069/4603088/4603088-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiran Tennakoon (S'02\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree (magna cum laude) from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 1995 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1998 and 2005, respectively.","From 1998 to 2001, he was with Moscape, Inc., and Magma Design Automation as a Software Engineer.

The accuracy of the model may be sacrificed in this quest to generate convex delay models. In this paper, we investigate the use of signomial delay modeling for area/delay optimization. We present a procedure to automatically generate signomial gate delay models by nonlinear least squares fitting. As opposed to posynomial models, signomial models achieve better fits to SPICE generated data. However, signomials are not convex in general. Nevertheless, we show via duality arguments that we obtain near optimum (within 1%) solutions. Our optimization considers beta-ratio constraints, minimum and maximum size constraints for n- and p-transistors, rise/fall delays, and edge rates. The gate sizes for the fastest delay solution for a 44000-cell design, using the IBM 130-nm process, can be achieved in about 16 min of CPU time on a PC, and the area-delay tradeoff curve for 21 points can be generated in about 2 h of CPU time.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/4603093/04603103.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random-Forests-Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Random-Forests-Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603103/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10177456","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603103/","volume":"38","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random-Forests-Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems","sourcePdf":"38tsmcc05-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078059S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4603093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"231","xplore-issue":"4603093","articleId":"4603103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4603112,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Maeda","affiliation":["Earth Observation Research Center, Japan AeroSpace Exploration Agency, Ibaraki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4603104/4603112/4603112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takashi Maeda (M'07) received the B.E. degree in electric and electronics engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in informatics and Ph.D. degree in electric and electronics engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Researcher with Earth Observation Research Center (EORC), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Ibaraki, Japan.

The detailed information have revealed new physical features, which are, to our best knowledge, seen for the first time. This realistic approach includes the 3-D configuration of structures and the full-wave electromagnetic properties. Increasing the aspect ratio of a continuous microstrip line strengthens the fundamental transverse electromagnetic mode and weakens the higher order transverse magnetic modes. However, the introduction of gap discontinuity in the line enhances the mode strength in the vicinity of the gap. The physical interpretations of these results have been discussed in the paper. Moreover, the effects of line topology on the evolution of modes are illustrated.

Scattering parameters (S-parameters) of the transmission-line sections, including a parallel plate, microstrip, and stripline, are measured. Wave equations for TEM/quasi-TEM mode with a complex propagation constant and a frequency-dependent wave impedance are used to evaluate the corresponding S-parameters in an analytical model. The discrepancy between the modeled and measured S-parameters is defined as the objective function in the GA. The GA is used for search of the dispersive-medium parameters by means of minimizing the objective function over the entire frequency range of interest. The reconstructed Debye or Lorentzian dispersive material parameters are corroborated by comparing the original measurements with the FDTD modeling results. The self-consistency of the proposed method is demonstrated by constructing different test structures with an identical material, i.e., material parameters of a substrate extracted from different transmission-line configurations. The port effects on the material parameter extraction are examined by using through-reflection-line calibration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic

In this paper, we propose several multiscale nonlinear thresholding methods for ultrasound speckle suppression. The wavelet coefficients of the logarithm of image are modeled as the sum of a noise-free component plus an independent noise. Assuming that the noise-free component has some local mixture distribution (MD), and the noise is either Gaussian or Rayleigh, we derive the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and the averaged maximum (AMAP) estimators for noise reduction. We use Gaussian and Laplacian MD for each noise-free wavelet coefficient to characterize their heavy-tailed property. Since we estimate the parameters of the MD using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and local neighbors, the proposed MD incorporates some information about the intrascale dependency of the wavelet coefficients. To evaluate our spatially adaptive despeckling methods, we use both real medical ultrasound and synthetically introduced speckle images for speckle suppression. The simulation results show that our method outperforms several recently and the state-of-the-art techniques qualitatively and quantitatively.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.923140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603151","startPage":"2152","endPage":"2160","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4603151/04603158.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speckle Noise Reduction of Medical Ultrasound Images in Complex Wavelet Domain Using Mixture Priors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speckle Noise Reduction of Medical Ultrasound Images in Complex Wavelet Domain Using Mixture Priors","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10158538","pubMedId":"18713684","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speckle Noise Reduction of Medical Ultrasound Images in Complex Wavelet Domain Using Mixture Priors","sourcePdf":"55tbme09-rabbani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058047S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4603151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"96","articleId":"4603158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4603170,"authors":[{"name":"SangBum Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4603161/4603170/4603170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["SangBum Kim (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2005.

The RFNNINC is developed to allow the linearized system performance to approximate the set impedance model accurately. The nonlinear term error between the system and linearized model uses the RFNNRC to compensate. Furthermore, when the system suffers external load and parameter variances, the RFNNRC can provide comparative force to resist the disturbances, allowing the entire system to be robust. Overall, the system is robust and has the desired impedance response.

An autonomous iteration-based algorithm is proposed to identify faulty links for LEO satellite systems employing intersatellite links (ISL's). A designed network satellite with management responsibilities collects the routing information of communication itself with other satellites, based on which a fault diagnosis model is introduced. Then the most likely faulty link is identified by using an iteration-based probability method, in conjuction with which an autonomuos localization procedure is described to pinpoint the actual faulty links.

However, the theoretical reasons for these have not been well investigated yet. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model about beamforming. In the new model, beamforming is posed as ill-conditioned linear equations. The new model can clearly explain why the MVDR method suffers significant performance degradation when the knowledge about the steering vector is imprecise and the sample size is finite. Using the new model, we also propose a new beamformer for the PAM communication, which is termed as \"decision and resolving beamformer\". Numerical experiments have shown the robustness of the proposed beamformer against imprecise knowledge on the steering vector and/or against the finite signal length effect.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2008.4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603188/4603189/04603541.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2008.4","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","startPage":"352","endPage":"352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A \"Decision and Re-Solving\" Beamformer for the PAM Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A \"Decision and Re-Solving\" Beamformer for the PAM Communication System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603541/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603541/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10184740","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A \"Decision and Re-Solving\" Beamformer for the PAM Communication System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"31610352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04707S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603188","isNumber":"4603189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603188","xplore-issue":"4603189","articleId":"4603541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4603547,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279527900"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37696960400"},{"name":"Wenlong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wenlong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37695707300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4603547","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603547","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Robustness","Cryptography","Copyright protection","Authentication","Security","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright protection","tampering localization","digital audio watermarking technique","region of interest audio","binary watermark image","fast fixed-point independent component analysis algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The rapid growth of Internet and digital multimedia has made the authority and integrity of audio information more and more important issues.

The method which adopts the change of the network traffic feature parameters distribution to discover anomalies is different from previous methods which pay more attention to the volume of the traffic.

The first problem is that the between-class and within-class scatter matrices of LDA cannot be evaluated accurately because their dimensions are usually much larger than the number of available image samples. The second problem is the small sample size (SSS) problem. However, if the face image can be resized into a small dimension, these difficulties may be overcome. With this paper, we analyze possible means to make LDA more feasible and effective for face recognition. Analysis and experiments show that down-sampling is very helpful for LDA to be performed with ease for face recognition. We compare a number of schemes that are used to exploit and combine information of the multi-level down-sampling results of the face images. We find that resizing conventional face images into smaller sizes may allow discriminant performance of LDA to be improved. There are two underlying reasons. The first one is that the face image of a lower dimension is very effective in helping LDA evaluate the between-class and within-class matrices more accurately. The second one is that LDA incline to obtain their best performance in an appropriate low resolution whereas the quantity of discriminant information what human beings can obtain is directly proportional to the resolution.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2008.234","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603188/4603189/04603581.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2008.234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Down-Sampling Face Images and Low-Resolution Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603581/","displayDocTitle":"Down-Sampling Face Images and Low-Resolution Face Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10184811","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603581/","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Down-Sampling Face Images and Low-Resolution Face Recognition","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"31610392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056686S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603188","isNumber":"4603189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603188","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4603189","articleId":"4603581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4603590,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37697605500"},{"name":"Zhijing Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhijing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37307342200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4603590","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Distance measurement","Clustering algorithms","Visualization","Real time systems","Pixel","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","geometry","image motion analysis","image sequences","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image contour","fuzzy neural network","human motion visual analysis","video sequences","intelligent monitoring system","Euclidean distance","affine transformation","fuzzy function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603590","abstract":"Visual analysis of human motion in video sequences has attached more and more attention to computer visions in recent years. In order to indicate pedestrian movement in Intelligent Monitoring System, a Euclidean distance based on centroid method is proposed. And then according to the movement of body a set of standard images contour are made. All matrixes which represent human silhouette are normalized using affine transformation, which cuts computational cost. The difference between two matrixes is regard as fuzzy function. Fuzzy neural network is proposed to infer abnormal behavior of the walker. First of all, a four layer fuzzy neural network is presented. And then Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used to calculate the number of hidden layer nodes.

In this paper, an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme applied to variable bit rate services is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. The objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency by adaptively selecting the code and allocating rate and power over the frequency band under the packet error rate constraint. Following analysis on rate-compatible punctured convolutional codes and linking adaptive techniques in OFDM, a sub-optimal AMC scheme with uniform power allocation is investigated. We realize the rate allocation by setting the instantaneous bit error rate to the average bit error rate which varies over different coding schemes. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits 4~8dB signal-noise-ratio gain relative to non-adaptive scheme. Compared to optimal scheme, the proposed scheme shows negligible loss at high SNR scenarios while the implementation complexity can be reduced significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2008.91","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603188/4603189/04603638.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2008.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spectrum Effective Adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme for OFDM System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603638/","displayDocTitle":"A Spectrum Effective Adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme for OFDM System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10184919","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603638/","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spectrum Effective Adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme for OFDM System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"31610449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044371S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603188","isNumber":"4603189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603188","xplore-issue":"4603189","articleId":"4603638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4603641,"authors":[{"name":"Zuyuan Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zuyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538729300"},{"name":"Guoxu Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Guoxu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37533982900"},{"name":"Jinlong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37697615300"},{"name":"Yuanjian Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yuanjian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37695928100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4603641","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Covariance matrix","Blind source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Algorithm design and analysis","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","signal temporal predictability","second order statistics","probability density function"]}],"abstract":"Based on the fact that the temporal predictability of signals is often different, new algorithm using second order statistics for blind source separation (BSS) is proposed in this work.

The experimental results show the model is well built and better performance can be gained with the new optimization algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2008.519","startPage":"458","endPage":"458","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603188/4603189/04603647.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2008.519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Convergent Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization and Performance Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Mathematical model","Equations","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergent fuzzy particle swarm optimization","performance analysis","searching ability","convergent gene","fuzzy membership function","velocity equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Study on Convergent Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization and Performance Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603647/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10184928","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on Convergent Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization and Performance Analysis","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"31610458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047317S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603188","isNumber":"4603189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603188","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4603189","articleId":"4603647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4603650,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Chann Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Chann","lastName":"Chang","id":"37573663000"},{"name":"Wei-Hsiu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Hsiu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37574641900"},{"name":"Ching-Jung Ting","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Jung","lastName":"Ting","id":"37582174900"},{"name":"Chin-Yuan Fan","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Yuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37694016100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4603650","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Diversity reception","Evolutionary computation","Traveling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","genetic algorithms","mathematical operators","search problems","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic diversity control","genetic algorithm","searching solution space exploration","multiobjective TSP","premature convergence","genetic operators","evolutionary process","artificial chromosomes","traveling salesman problem","global convergence behavior"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603650","abstract":"Premature convergence in the process of genetic algorithm (GA) for searching solution is frequently faced and the evolutionary processes are often trapped in a local but not global optimum. This phenomenon occurs when the population of a genetic algorithm reaches a suboptimal state that the genetic operators can no longer produce offspring with a better performance than their parents. In the literature, plenty of work has been investigated to introduce new methods and operators in order to overcome this essential problem of genetic algorithms. As these methods and the belonging operators are rather problem specific in general. In this research, we observe the progress of the evolutionary process, and when the diversity of the population dropping below a threshold level then artificial chromosomes with high diversity will be introduced to increase the average diversity level thus to ensure the process can jump out the local optimum. The proposed approach is implemented independently of the problem characteristics and can be applied to improve the global convergence behavior of genetic algorithms. We eventually apply this approach to solve Multi-Objective (MO) Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) which were combined KroA with KroB, KroC, KroD and KroE to be trade-off problems. The result shows the solution quality to validate the adaptability of DDCGA for solving such problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2008.239","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603188/4603189/04603650.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"461","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2008.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Diversity Control in Genetic Algorithm for Extended Exploration of Solution Space in Multi-Objective TSP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Diversity Control in Genetic Algorithm for Extended Exploration of Solution Space in Multi-Objective TSP","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10184951","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4603650/","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Diversity Control in Genetic Algorithm for Extended Exploration of Solution Space in Multi-Objective TSP","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"31610461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039016S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603188","isNumber":"4603189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603188","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4603189","articleId":"4603650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4603654,"authors":[{"name":"Meijuan Li","affiliation":["Anshan Normal University, China","Dalian University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Meijuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37536969600"},{"name":"Xuebo Chen","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xuebo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278213400"},{"name":"Chenqi Liu","affiliation":["Anshan Normal University, China"],"firstName":"Chenqi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37696650200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4603654","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Resource management","Stability analysis","Filtering algorithms","Warehousing","Bills of materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","order picking","Pareto optimisation","warehouse automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimization","niche genetic algorithm","storage location assignment","class-based storage","automated warehouse","multiobjective mathematical model","rack stability","order picking frequency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603654","abstract":"Class-based storage and storage location assignment implementation decisions have significant impact on the required storage space and product picking efficiency in an automated warehouse.

To reduce the iterative delay resulted from (de)interleaver; a new parallel algorithm for turbo decoder is proposed. Different than the previous approaches which use multiple units to process sub-block MAP decoding in parallel, the new parallel turbo decoder immediately passes the extrinsic information of one component decoder to the other decoders bit-by-bit. The decoding processes of component decoders perform concurrently and the (de)interleaver delay is eliminated. Simulation results demonstrate that with this parallel scheme, decoding latency is reduced while the performance in terms of BER is comparable, and in some cases superior, to a general turbo decoder. Furthermore, the proposed parallel algorithm can be used to cooperate with those parallel MAP decoding schemes to reduce more decoding latency.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2008.341","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Innovative Computing Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603188/4603189/04603722.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2008.341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Latency Turbo Decoder Design by Concurrent Decoding of Component Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Latency Turbo Decoder Design by Concurrent Decoding of Component Codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10183261","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603722/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603722/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Latency Turbo Decoder Design by Concurrent Decoding of Component Codes","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"31610533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072946S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603188","isNumber":"4603189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603188","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4603189","articleId":"4603722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4603728,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Bao Li","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Test and Control, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jun-Bao","lastName":"Li","id":"37292379900"},{"name":"Shu-Chuan Chu","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Cheng Shiu University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Chuan","lastName":"Chu","id":"37420219100"},{"name":"Jeng-Shyang Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jeng-Shyang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37277290900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3161-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4603728","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"In the face recognition area, a so-called one sample per person problem occurred owing to the difficulties of collecting samples or storage space of systems.

However, implementation of modern nanotechnology devices requires paying strict attention to parasitic effects, such as jitter which is caused by switching the entire device core logic elements (Core jitter) as well as the output buffer jitter caused by switching the inputs and outputs (I/O) of the device. These timing variations decrease the timing margin and limit the achievable data rate of an integrated circuit (IC). This paper presents a study of the jitter effects due to core noise and I/O noise on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) manufactured using both 90-nm and 65-nm process technologies respectively. This paper evaluates the impact of the following factors on Core Jitter: aggressor location in a device; aggressor switching frequency, and aggressor pattern type and switching core logic percentage. The timing variations based on switching I/O are also studied. The results can assist electronic system designers with methods of reducing Core jitter and I/O jitter, and thus achieve error-free design goals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of jitter effects in nm-FPGA based on various physical and electrical quantities","doi":"10.1109/APACE.2007.4603875","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APACE.2007.4603875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603849","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595516/4603849/04603875.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A study of jitter effects in nm-FPGA based on various physical and electrical quantities","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603875/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10183780","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of jitter effects in nm-FPGA based on various physical and electrical quantities","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"APACE45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046727S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4595516","isNumber":"4603849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595516","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4603849","articleId":"4603875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4603876,"authors":[{"name":"Indu Saini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Dr B.

In contrast to existing power control and optimization approaches, our proposed method uses an adaptive power control (APC) approach for a relay station to reduce interferences to other mobile station (MS) or relay station (RS) within the same cell and hence increase the number of hops per link and consequently maximize the spatial reuse. The proposed power control is applied to a new dynamic HARQ algorithm for adaptive channel quality enhancement.

Despite of many advantages of OFDM, one major problem which degrades its performance is the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Nowadays; clipping has become a well known technique in reducing PAPR due to its simplicity. However, this technique has caused the degradation of bit error rate (BER) and enhanced and enhanced the growth of out of band radiation (OOBR) which has led to the degradation of OFDM overall performance. In this paper, an OFDM system with enhanced clipping technique is designed, evaluated and optimized. The system is designed with the objective to further reduce the high peak average power ratio (PAPR) value by means of clipping while minimizing the negative effects caused by clipping. The optimum values of designed parameters have resulted in maximum PAPR reduction and OOBR suppression capability of 16 dB and 70 dB respectively at the cut-off BER of 5.75 times 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595516/4603849/04603933.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics","doi":"10.1109/APACE.2007.4603933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APACE.2007.4603933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis and optimization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system with enhanced clipping technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Finite impulse response filter","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","Power harmonic filters","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","limiters","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","enhanced clipping technique","communication channel","peak to average power ratio","bit error rate","out of band radiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","clipping technique","PAPR","OOBR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis and optimization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system with enhanced clipping technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603933/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10183181","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis and optimization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system with enhanced clipping technique","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"APACE127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052832S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4595516","isNumber":"4603849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595516","xplore-issue":"4603849","articleId":"4603933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4603936,"authors":[{"name":"Yerram Ravinder","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering, ECE Department, Osmania University, University College of Engineering, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Yerram","lastName":"Ravinder","id":"37689630500"},{"name":"V.M.

Recently, however wireless mesh networking is attracting significant interest from academia, industry, and standard organizations because it is offer several favorable characteristics such as dynamic self-organization, easy maintenance and reliable services. A network with several transmitters and receivers that communicate to each other will form a mesh network topology. Once the transmitter launches a ray, it will be reflected, refracted or diffracted to any kind of surfaces such as the concrete wall. That process will decrease the received signal strength at the receiver. So, ray-tracing technique can be used to analyze the network performance. It is a method that used to determine the ray paths that emanate from the transmitter (Tx) and arrive at the receiver (Rx), and also an efficient approach in determining the propagation issues in wireless environment. So, this paper will be focused on Ray-Tracing techniques and WMNs theories.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595516/4603849/04603949.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics","doi":"10.1109/APACE.2007.4603949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APACE.2007.4603949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4603949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-tracing propagation prediction for wireless mesh networks (WMNs)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Peer to peer computing","Ad hoc networks","Wireless communication","Wireless LAN","Wireless mesh networks","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio networks","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray-tracing propagation prediction","wireless mesh networks","mesh network topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Mesh Networks","Ray-Tracing","Propagation prediction","Topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4603949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Ray-tracing propagation prediction for wireless mesh networks (WMNs)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4603949/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10183841","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-tracing propagation prediction for wireless mesh networks (WMNs)","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"APACE149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063855S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4595516","isNumber":"4603849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595516","xplore-issue":"4603849","articleId":"4603949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4603955,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the performance of radio over fiber links for WCDMA by simulation. The developed simulation models have integrated systems for both RF wireless and optical fiber systems that would be transparent to a UMTS system. Whereby, in this WCDMA RoF network model consists of central station, one remote access unit and an optical fiber link model that uses commercially available parameters. In this system, external modulators technique which is electroabsorption modulator is applied.

Experimental results showed that higher PSNR are also obtained from our proposed method than those from others.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.283","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603986/4603987/04604136.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Bilinear Interpolation of Motion Vectors for Quad-Tree Mesh","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604136/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Bilinear Interpolation of Motion Vectors for Quad-Tree Mesh","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10181926","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4604136/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Bilinear Interpolation of Motion Vectors for Quad-Tree Mesh","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"3278a635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043708S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603986","isNumber":"4603987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603986","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4603987","articleId":"4604136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4604139,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Fa Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Fa","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37693147300"},{"name":"Tsung-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Han","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37271381400"},{"name":"Chih-Hung Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hung","lastName":"Lai","id":"37691722100"},{"name":"Tai-An Shan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tai-An","lastName":"Shan","id":"37686864200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3278-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4604139","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Efficient VLSI Architecture of 2-D Discrete Wavelet Transform","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel, efficient VLSI architecture for the implementation of the forward two-dimension, lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

The architecture merges the lifting step and adopts the pipelined design to adjust the primitive data path. The proposed 2-D DWT architecture consists of four parts: column filter module, 2times2 transposing module, row filter module and scaling module. The column filter and row filter process simultaneously. The 2times2 transposing module makes it true that several registers substitute a lot of intermediate transposing memory. The architecture introduces 4 to 1 multiplexer into scaling module. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture, under the tight critical path, can efficiently reduce the hardware overhead and save the hardware power.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.56","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4603986/4603987/04604271.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603987","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Hardware Implementation Architecture for DWT of Lifting Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Hardware Implementation Architecture for DWT of Lifting Scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604271/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10182064","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4604271/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Hardware Implementation Architecture for DWT of Lifting Scheme","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"3278b255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091965S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4603986","isNumber":"4603987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4603986","xplore-issue":"4603987","articleId":"4604271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4604291,"authors":[{"name":"Haiting Cui","affiliation":["College of Information Technology and Communication, Qufu Normal University, Rizhao, China"],"firstName":"Haiting","lastName":"Cui","id":"37692670400"},{"name":"Xinchun Cui","affiliation":["College of Information Technology and Communication, Qufu Normal University, Rizhao, China"],"firstName":"Xinchun","lastName":"Cui","id":"37686761400"},{"name":"Mailing Meng","affiliation":["College of Information Technology and Communication, Qufu Normal University, Rizhao, China"],"firstName":"Mailing","lastName":"Meng","id":"37690891800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3278-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4604291","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604291","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Public key","Databases","Relational databases","Cryptography","Integrated circuits","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","relational databases","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","watermarking","relational databases","asymmetric keys","private key copyright watermark"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["relational database watermark","public key","trusted center IPR"]}],"abstract":"By introducing public key cryptography, a novel algorithm for watermarking relational databases is proposed.

The class separation is increased by using the proper HMM structure, the variable number of HMM states and a large-margin HMM training algorithm, based on the extension of the training sequence.","doi":"10.1109/IWSSIP.2008.4604407","publicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595514/4604343/04604407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWSSIP.2008.4604407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604343","startPage":"221","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large Margin Hidden Markov Models in command recognition and speaker verification problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large Margin Hidden Markov Models in command recognition and speaker verification problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604407/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10183141","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4604407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Margin Hidden Markov Models in command recognition and speaker verification problems","confLoc":"Bratislava, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"056 Large Margin Hidden Markov Models in command recognition.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074602S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595514","isNumber":"4604343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595514","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4604343","articleId":"4604407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"15th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4604412,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre L.

The advantage of the DTW algorithm is that it requires only one prototype (sample) for each class, that is, a single representative template is enough for classification purposes. The LSTM network is a novel recurrent network architecture that implements an appropriate gradient-based learning algorithm. It overcomes the vanishing-gradient problem. Experiments with images from the MIT-CBCL face recognition database provided good results for both approaches. For DTW, the obtained results indicate that the proposed method is robust against the presence of random noise on observations and templates, since it is capable to deal with unpredictable variations. The LSTM training achieved good performance even with small feature sets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel approaches for face recognition: Template-matching using Dynamic Time Warping and LSTM neural network supervised classification","doi":"10.1109/IWSSIP.2008.4604412","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWSSIP.2008.4604412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604343","publicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595514/4604343/04604412.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Novel approaches for face recognition: Template-matching using Dynamic Time Warping and LSTM neural network supervised classification","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10183143","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel approaches for face recognition: Template-matching using Dynamic Time Warping and LSTM neural network supervised classification","confLoc":"Bratislava, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"061 Novel Approaches for Face Recognition Template-Matching .pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05898S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2008","isNumber":"4604343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595514","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4604412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4604432,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In order to ensure that the performance of multibiometric systems such as fingerprint and iris will be powerful with respect to the quality of obtained fingerprint and iris images, these images are denoised and enhanced. In this study, curvelet transform is applied biometric images for enhancement. Obtained results after applied curvelet transform is compared to the other traditional image enhancement algorithms. Features obtained from enhanced fingerprints and iris images are selected by using genetic algorithms because of too huge dataset.

Our daily energy consumption per a customer is 0.83 Wh/day for a terminal and 120 Wh/day for the mobile network. The terminal side energy consumption is negligible in view of total CO2 emission though, limitation of its battery performance raises another issue called \"energy starvation of mobile devices.\" The demographic data leads our discussion to (1) radio-on-fiber access network architecture as green networks and (2) thin client models as the key to sustain the evolution toward the future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10182130","htmlLink":"/document/4604612/","conferenceDate":"28 July-1 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Energy Consumption Issues on Mobile Network Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Consumption Issues on Mobile Network Systems","confLoc":"Turku, Finland","sourcePdf":"3297a365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032327S","chronDate":"July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604513","isNumber":"4604514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604513","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4604514","articleId":"4604612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4604614,"authors":[{"name":"Manos M.

However, unlike track-bound sports cars, ultra-fast and purpose-built silicon yields better energy efficiency when compared to more generic \"family sedan\" designs that mitigate go-to-market risks by being the masters of many tasks. Thus, we demonstrate that the best opportunities for power savings come via protocol simplification, best-of-breed technology, and silicon and software optimization, to achieve the least amount of processing necessary to move packets. We also look to the future of networking from a new angle, where energy efficiency and environmental concerns are viewed as fundamental design criteria and forces that need to be harnessed to continually create more powerful networking equipment.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/4604513/4604514/04604616.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"384","doi":"10.1109/SAINT.2008.79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAINT.2008.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Saving Strategies and Technologies in Network Equipment Opportunities and Challenges, Risk and Rewards","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power Saving Strategies and Technologies in Network Equipment Opportunities and Challenges, Risk and Rewards","htmlLink":"/document/4604616/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10182152","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 July-1 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Saving Strategies and Technologies in Network Equipment Opportunities and Challenges, Risk and Rewards","confLoc":"Turku, Finland","sourcePdf":"3297a381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034963S","chronDate":"July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4604513","isNumber":"4604514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4604513","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4604514","articleId":"4604616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4604653,"authors":[{"name":"Jonghwan Park","affiliation":["Division of Applied Robot Technology, Korea Institute of Industrial and Technology, Ansan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4623193/4604653/4604653-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jonghwan Park received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, in 1992, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Korea, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He was with the Air Force as an Engineering Officer from 1993 to 1996 and with the Research and Development Center, LS Industrial Systems Company until 1999.

Such algorithms are characterized by a nonanalytic optimization process when dealing with complex systems as multiple behavioral responses occur in the realization of intelligent tasks. In generic EAs which optimize internal parameters of a given system, evaluation and selection are performed at the chromosome level. When a survived chromosome includes noneffective genes, the solution can be trapped in a local optimum during evolution, which causes an increase in the uncertainty of the results and reduces the quality of the overall system. This phenomenon also results in an unbalanced performance of partial behaviors. To alleviate this problem, a score-based resampling method is proposed, where a score function of a gene is introduced as a criterion of handling genes in each allele. The proposed method was empirically evaluated with various test functions, and the results show its effectiveness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4623193/04604653.pdf","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1355","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Score-Based Resampling Method for Evolutionary Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Score-Based Resampling Method for Evolutionary Algorithms","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4604653/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185919","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","pubMedId":"18784016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604653/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Score-Based Resampling Method for Evolutionary Algorithms","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb05-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063802S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4623193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4623193","articleId":"4604653","onlineDate":"22 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4604657,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Ki Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yong Ki","lastName":"Lee","id":"37635512200"},{"name":"Kazuo Sakiyama","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Sakiyama","id":"37281944700"},{"name":"Lejla Batina","affiliation":["ESAT/SCD, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lejla","lastName":"Batina","id":"37272479700"},{"name":"Ingrid Verbauwhede","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","ESAT/SCD, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Verbauwhede","id":"37274332200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"4604657","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":152,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1170},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Radiofrequency identification","Computer architecture","Protocols","Random access memory","Security","Elliptic curves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","public key cryptography","radiofrequency identification","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elliptic-curve-based security processor","RFID","radio frequency identification","public-key based approach","register file","redundant modular operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Support for security","Micro-architecture implementation considerations","Processor Architectures","Compu","Special-purpose","General","Low-power design"]},{"kwd":["Support for security","Micro-architecture implementation considerations","Processor Architectures","Compu","Special-purpose","General","Low-power design"]}],"abstract":"RFID (radio frequency identification) tags need to include security functions, yet at the same time their resources are extremely limited. Moreover, to provide privacy, authentication and protection against tracking of RFID tags without loosing the system scalability, a public-key based approach is inevitable, which is shown by M. Burmester et al. In this paper, we present an architecture of a state-of-the-art processor for RFID tags with an elliptic curve (EC) processor over GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">163</sup>\n). It shows the plausibility of meeting both security and efficiency requirements even in a passive RFID tag. The proposed processor is able to perform EC scalar multiplications as well as general modular arithmetic (additions and multiplications) which are needed for the cryptographic protocols. As we work with large numbers, the register file is the most critical component in the architecture. By combining several techniques, we are able to reduce the number of registers from 9 to 6 resulting in EC processor of 10.1 K gates. To obtain an efficient modulo arithmetic, we introduce a redundant modular operation. Moreover the proposed architecture can support multiple cryptographic protocols. The synthesis results with a 0.13 um CMOS technology show that the gate area of the most compact version is 12.5 K gates.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4633723/04604657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4633723","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elliptic-Curve-Based Security Processor for RFID","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Elliptic-Curve-Based Security Processor for RFID","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208628","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4604657/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elliptic-Curve-Based Security Processor for RFID","sourcePdf":"ttc2008111514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05116S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"4633723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"152","articleId":"4604657","onlineDate":"22 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4604658,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Maistri","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Architecture (TIMA) Laboratory, Techniques of Informatics and Microelectronics, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4633723/4604658/4604658-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Maistri received the MSc degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC) in 2001 and the degree in computer engineering and the PhD degree in computer engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

It discretizes continuous features and then summarizes the data using a contingency table. Inconsistency rate for different subsets of features can then be easily calculated from the contingency table. Sequential search is then used to find the best feature subset. After the number of features is reduced to a certain extent, easy-to-understand knowledge can be intuitively derived from data summary. Another desirable feature of the proposed method is its capability to learn incrementally; namely, knowledge can be updated quickly whenever new data are obtained. Moreover, the proposed method is capable of handling missing values when used for prediction. The method is applied on two benchmark data sets showing its effectiveness on selecting discriminative features. The practical usefulness of this method in manufacturing is demonstrated through an application on welding fault diagnosis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/4626023/04604676.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TII.2008.2002920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2008.2002920","startPage":"198","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and Efficient Rule Extraction Through Data Summarization and Its Application in Welding Fault Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604676/","displayDocTitle":"Robust and Efficient Rule Extraction Through Data Summarization and Its Application in Welding Fault Diagnosis","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4604676/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"10222496","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and Efficient Rule Extraction Through Data Summarization and Its Application in Welding Fault Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tii-huang-2002920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117475S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"4626023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4626023","articleId":"4604676","onlineDate":"22 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4604687,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Dong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Dong","id":"37691604100"},{"name":"Ruikang Zhang","affiliation":["Accelink Technologies Company Limited, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ruikang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37691216400"},{"name":"Dingli Wang","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Key Laboratory of Acoustic and Photonic Materials and Devices of the Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Dingli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37695474300"},{"name":"Shan Jiang","affiliation":["Accelink Technologies Company Limited, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37440339900"},{"name":"Yonglin Yu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yonglin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279647500"},{"name":"Shengzhi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Shengzhi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37281457600"},{"name":"Shuihua Liu","affiliation":["Accelink Technologies Company Limited, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shuihua","lastName":"Liu","id":"37696135600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4604687","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604687","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunable circuits and devices","Distributed Bragg reflectors","Laser modes","Digital filters","Laser theory","Optical filters","Laser tuning","Semiconductor lasers","Delay","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffraction gratings","digital filters","distributed Bragg reflector lasers","laser tuning","semiconductor lasers","transfer function matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength switching","sampled-grating DBR lasers","traveling-wave model","digital filter approach","sampled-grating distributed Bragg reflector lasers","transfer-matrix method","mode-competition behaviors","transient spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital filter approach","dynamic wavelength switching","sampled-grating distributed Bragg reflector laser (SGDBR)","transfer-matrix method","traveling-wave method","widely tunable semiconductor lasers"]}],"abstract":"A dynamic theoretical model has been proposed for simulating the wavelength switching performance of widely tunable sampled-grating distributed Bragg reflector lasers.

A method is proposed at the optical cross-connect (not at the transmitter end) to alleviate this degradation, in which the impairing RZ-OOK channel is converted to RZ binary phase-shift keying (RZ-BPSK) in a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) prior to 50-GHz-spaced WDM transmission. The data format conversion completely compensates for the XPM degradation, while resulting in an optical signal-to-noise ratio transmission penalty of <2 dB for converted RZ-BPSK relative to RZ-OOK. Moreover, the wavelength conversion may be used to address contention resolution at the cross-connects.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2008.2003422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/4633706/04604695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2008.2003422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4633706","startPage":"1715","endPage":"1717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of XPM Penalty in 10-Gb/s OOK/DBPSK Mixed Modulation Format 50-GHz-Spaced WDM Transmission by Conversion of OOK to BPSK Using an SOA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of XPM Penalty in 10-Gb/s OOK/DBPSK Mixed Modulation Format 50-GHz-Spaced WDM Transmission by Conversion of OOK to BPSK Using an SOA","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"20","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2008","accessionNumber":"10235650","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4604695/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of XPM Penalty in 10-Gb/s OOK/DBPSK Mixed Modulation Format 50-GHz-Spaced WDM Transmission by Conversion of OOK to BPSK Using an SOA","sourcePdf":"lpt-astar-2003422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03627S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4633706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4633706","articleId":"4604695","onlineDate":"22 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4604707,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed El-Darawy","affiliation":["Department of Optical Communication and High-Frequency Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"El-Darawy","id":"38275154100"},{"name":"Timo Pfau","affiliation":["Department of Optical Communication and High-Frequency Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Pfau","id":"37321336700"},{"name":"Sebastian Hoffmann","affiliation":["Department of Optical Communication and High-Frequency Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37316312800"},{"name":"Ralf Peveling","affiliation":["Department of System and Circuit Technology, Heinz Nixdorf Institute, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Peveling","id":"37317226700"},{"name":"Christian Wordehoff","affiliation":["Department of System and Circuit Technology, Heinz Nixdorf Institute, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wordehoff","id":"37317227400"},{"name":"Benjamin Koch","affiliation":["Department of Optical Communication and High-Frequency Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Koch","id":"37319382000"},{"name":"Mario Porrmann","affiliation":["Department of System and Circuit Technology, Heinz Nixdorf Institute, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Porrmann","id":"37266925900"},{"name":"Olaf Adamczyk","affiliation":["Department of Optical Communication and High-Frequency Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Olaf","lastName":"Adamczyk","id":"37317226900"},{"name":"Reinhold Noe","affiliation":["Department of Optical Communication and High-Frequency Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Reinhold","lastName":"Noe","id":"37268699000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4604707","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"Fast polarization changes of 40 krad/s and 6-dB polarization-dependent loss (PDL) are tracked in a 2.8-Gb/s real-time coherent quadrature phase-shift keying receiver.

Using game theoretic tools, a useful framework is provided in order to determine the optimal power allocation when users know only their own channel (while perfect channel state information is assumed at the base station). This scenario illustrates the case of decentralized schemes, where limited information on the network is available at the terminal. Various receivers are considered, namely the matched filter, the MMSE filter and the optimum filter. The goal of this paper is to extend previous work, and to derive simple expressions for the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium as the number of mobiles becomes large and the spreading length increases. To that end two asymptotic methodologies are combined. The first is asymptotic random matrix theory which allows us to obtain explicit expressions of the impact of all other mobiles on any given tagged mobile. The second is the theory of non-atomic games which computes good approximations of the Nash equilibrium as the number of mobiles grows.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Multiaccess communication","Matched filters","Power control","Base stations","Nash equilibrium","Distributed algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Performance analysis","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","fading channels","game theory","least mean squares methods","matched filters","matrix algebra","mobile radio","multiuser channels","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonatomic game theoretic tool","multiuser system","frequency selective fading channel","optimal power allocation","decentralized scheme","matched filter","minimum mean square error method","MMSE filter","noncooperative Nash equilibrium","asymptotic methodology","random matrix theory","mobile tag"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","random matrix theory","CDMA","resource allocation","MMSE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4604726/04604731.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Atomic Games for Multi-User Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Atomic Games for Multi-User Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604731/","volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4604731/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10180099","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Atomic Games for Multi-User Systems","sourcePdf":"1047jsac0808bonneau.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.226853S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4604726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4604726","articleId":"4604731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":4604732,"authors":[{"name":"Erik G.

We formulate a rate region which is achievable by scalar coding followed by power allocation and beamforming. We show that all interesting points on the Pareto boundary correspond to transmit strategies where both systems use the maximum available power. We then argue that there is a fundamental need for base station cooperation when performing spectrum sharing with multiple transmit antennas. More precisely, we show that if the systems do not cooperate, there is a unique Nash equilibrium which is inefficient in the sense that the achievable rate is bounded by a constant, regardless of the available transmit power. An extension of this result to the case where the receivers use successive interference cancellation (SIC) is also provided. Next we model the problem of agreeing on beamforming vectors as a non-transferable utility (NTU) cooperative gametheoretic problem, with the two operators as players. Specifically we compute numerically the Nash bargaining solution, which is a likely resolution of the resource conflict assuming that the players are rational. Numerical experiments indicate that selfish but cooperating operators may achieve a performance which is close to the maximum-sum-rate bound.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4604726/04604732.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competition Versus Cooperation on the MISO Interference Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604732/","displayDocTitle":"Competition Versus Cooperation on the MISO Interference Channel","volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180100","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4604732/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competition Versus Cooperation on the MISO Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"1059jsac0808larsson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072524S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4604726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"227","xplore-issue":"4604726","articleId":"4604732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4604733,"authors":[{"name":"Ishai Menache","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4604726/4604733/4604733-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ishai Menache received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Technion, Haifa, Israel, in 2008.

Each user wishes to minimize its average transmission rate (or power investment), subject to minimum throughput demand. The channel quality between each user and the base station is randomly time-varying, and partially observed by the user through Channel State Information (CSI) signals. Assuming that all users employ stationary, CSI-dependent transmission policies, we investigate the properties of the Nash equilibrium of the resulting game between users. We characterize the feasible region of user's throughput demands, and provide lower bounds on the channel capacity that hold both for symmetric and non-symmetric users. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that, when the throughput demands are feasible, there exist exactly two Nash equilibrium points, with one strictly better than the other (in terms of power investment) for each user. We further demonstrate that the performance gap between the two equilibria may be arbitrarily large. This motivates the need for distributed mechanisms that lead to the better equilibrium. To that end, we suggest a simple greedy (best-response) mechanism, and prove convergence to the better equilibrium. Some important stability properties of this mechanism in face of changing user population are derived as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4604726/04604733.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Based Equilibria in Collision Channels with Fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Throughput","Base stations","Investments","Nash equilibrium","Channel state information","Channel capacity","Convergence","Stability","Mechanical factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","fading channels","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-based equilibria","collision fading channels","base station","channel state information signals","CSI","Nash equilibrium","channel capacity","equilibrium analysis","greedy mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficient Nash equilibrium","non-cooperative multiple access","uplink collision channel","channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Rate-Based Equilibria in Collision Channels with Fading","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4604733/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180101","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Based Equilibria in Collision Channels with Fading","sourcePdf":"1070jsac0808menache.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113521S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4604726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4604726","articleId":"4604733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4604734,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Leshem","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4604726/4604734/4604734-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amir Leshem (M'98, SM'06) received the B.Sc.(cum laude) in mathematics and physics, the M.Sc.

This problem has been studied in a number of papers during the past decade for the case of frequency-selective channels. A variety of conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) and convergence of many different distributed algorithms have been derived. In this paper we provide a unified view of the state-of- the-art results, showing that most of the techniques proposed in the literature to study the game, even though apparently different, can be unified using our recent interpretation of the waterfilling operator as a projection onto a proper polyhedral set. Based on this interpretation, we then provide a mathematical framework, useful to derive a unified set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of the NE and the global convergence of waterfilling based asynchronous distributed algorithms. The proposed mathematical framework is also instrumental to study the extension of the game to the more general MIMO case, for which only few results are available in the current literature. The resulting algorithm is, similarly to the frequency-selective case, an iterative asynchronous MIMO waterfilling algorithm. The proof of convergence hinges again on the interpretation of the MIMO waterfilling as a matrix projection, which is the natural generalization of our results obtained for the waterfilling mapping in the frequency-selective case.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4604726/04604735.pdf","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive Design of Multiuser MIMO Systems Based on Game Theory: A Unified View","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604735/","displayDocTitle":"Competitive Design of Multiuser MIMO Systems Based on Game Theory: A Unified View","volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180103","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4604735/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive Design of Multiuser MIMO Systems Based on Game Theory: A Unified View","sourcePdf":"1089jsac0808scutari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115996S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4604726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"4604726","articleId":"4604735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4604736,"authors":[{"name":"Suhas Mathur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Rutgers University Technology Centre of New Jersey, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4604726/4604736/4604736-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suhas Mathur received the B.

Using the rate achieved by a user as its utility, it is shown that the stable coalition structure, i.e., set of coalitions from which users have no incentives to defect, depends on the manner in which the rate gains are apportioned among the cooperating users. Specifically, the stability of the grand coalition (GC), i.e., the coalition of all users, is studied. Transmitter and receiver cooperation in an interference channel (IC) are studied as illustrative cooperative models to determine the stable coalitions for both flexible (transferable) and fixed (non-transferable) apportioning schemes. It is shown that the stable sum-rate optimal coalition when only receivers cooperate by jointly decoding (transferable) is the GC. The stability of the GC depends on the detector when receivers cooperate using linear multiuser detectors (non-transferable). Transmitter cooperation is studied assuming that all receivers cooperate perfectly and that users outside a coalition act as jammers. The stability of the GC is studied for both the case of perfectly cooperating transmitters (transferrable) and under a partial decode-and-forward strategy (non-transferable). In both cases, the stability is shown to depend on the channel gains and the transmitter jamming strengths.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4604726/04604736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604726","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coalitions in Cooperative Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coalitions in Cooperative Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180104","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4604736/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coalitions in Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"1104jsac0808mathur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075161S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4604726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4604726","articleId":"4604736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4604737,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4604726/4604737/4604737-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Cui (S'04) received the M.Sc. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2005, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Caltech, Pasadena, USA, in 2006.

As examples, a series of utility functions is proposed for games achieving the maximum throughput in a network of homogeneous nodes. In a network with n traffic classes, an N-signal game model is proposed which achieves the maximum throughput under the fairness constraint among different traffic classes. In addition, the convergence of different dynamic algorithms such as best response, gradient play and Jacobi play under propagation delay and estimation error is established.

We assume that nodes are randomly scattered in a sensor field and the goal is to partition these nodes into K sets. At any given time, nodes belonging to only one of these sets actively sense the field. A key challenge is to achieve this partition in a distributed manner with purely local information and yet provide near optimal coverage. We appropriately formulate this coverage problem as a coverage game and prove that the optimal solution is a pure Nash equilibrium. Then, we design synchronous and asynchronous algorithms, which converge to pure Nash equilibria. Moreover, we analyze the optimality and complexity of pure Nash equilibria in the coverage game. We prove that, the ratio between the optimal coverage and the worst case Nash equilibrium coverage, is upper bounded by 2 - 1/m+1 (m is the maximum number of nodes, which cover any point, in the Nash equilibrium solution s*). We prove that finding pure Nash equilibria in the general coverage game is PLS-complete, i.e. \"as hard as that of finding a local optimum in any local search problem with efficient computable neighbors\". Finally, via extensive simulations, we show that, the Nash equilibria coverage performance is very close to the optimal coverage and the convergence speed is sublinear. Even under the noisy environment, our algorithms can still converge to the pure Nash equilibria.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4604726/04604742.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604726","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality and Complexity of Pure Nash Equilibria in the Coverage Game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimality and Complexity of Pure Nash Equilibria in the Coverage Game","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180109","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4604742/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality and Complexity of Pure Nash Equilibria in the Coverage Game","sourcePdf":"1170jsac0808ai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142299S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4604726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4604726","articleId":"4604742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4604744,"authors":[{"name":"Junjik Bae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4604726/4604744/4604744-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junjik Bae received the B.S. degree in Physics from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999, and the M.S. degree from Ohio State University in Columbus, OH, in 2001.

The resource is assumed to be managed by a spectrum broker (auctioneer), who collects bids and allocates discrete units of the resource via a sequential second-price auction. It is well known that a second price auction for a single indivisible good has an efficient dominant strategy equilibrium; this is no longer the case when multiple units of a homogeneous good are sold in repeated iterations. For two users with full information, we show that such an auction has a unique equilibrium allocation. The worst-case efficiency of this allocation is characterized under the following cases: (i) both bidders have a concave valuation for the spectrum resource, and (ii) one bidder has a concave valuation and the other bidder has a convex valuation (e.g., for the other useriquests power). Although the worst-case efficiency loss can be significant, numerical results are presented, which show that for randomly placed transmitter-receiver pairs with rate utility functions, the sequential second-price auction typically achieves the efficient allocation. For more than two users it is shown that this mechanism always has a pure strategy equilibrium, but in general there may be multiple equilibria. We give a constructive procedure for finding one equilibrium; numerical results show that when all users have concave valuations the efficiency loss decreases with an increase in the number of users.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4604726/04604744.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Bandwidth and Power Auctions for Distributed Spectrum Sharing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Resource management","Cost accounting","Wireless networks","Interference","Transmitters","Propagation losses","Cognitive radio","Radio control","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","radiocommunication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed spectrum sharing","sequential bandwidth","power auctions","wireless resource","sequential second-price auction","unique equilibrium allocation","worst-case efficiency loss","transmitter-receiver pairs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic spectrum sharing","resource allocation","mechanism design","auction","equilibrium","efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Bandwidth and Power Auctions for Distributed Spectrum Sharing","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4604744/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180111","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Bandwidth and Power Auctions for Distributed Spectrum Sharing","sourcePdf":"1193jsac0808bae.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065225S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4604726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4604726","articleId":"4604744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4604756,"authors":[{"name":"George Theodorakopoulos","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Research and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4604726/4604756/4604756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["George Theodorakopoulos received the B.S. degree from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, all in Electrical Engineering, in 2002, 2004, and 2007, respectively.","He is the co-recipient of the Best Paper award at the ACM Workshop on Wireless Security, October 2004, and the 2007 IEEE ComSoc Leonard Abraham prize.

The legitimate users are, at least initially, unaware of the type (legitimate or malicious) of the other users.

SMDB is compared with another statistical CAC based on the normal/lognormal distribution of the GOP rate (SMND). SMDB outperforms SMND in many situations such as high variance around the average video traffic GOP rate of sources and heavy traffic load.

A new strategy based on forecasting system degradation through a prognostic process is required. The recent advances in model-based design technology have realized significant time savings in product development cycle. These advances facilitate the integration of model-based diagnosis and prognosis of systems, leading to condition-based maintenance and increased availability of systems. With an accurate simulation model of a system, diagnostics and prognostics can be synthesized concurrently with system design. In this paper, we develop an integrated prognostic process based on data collected from model-based simulations under nominal and degraded conditions. Prognostic models are constructed based on different random load conditions (modes). An interacting multiple model (IMM) is used to track the hidden damage. Remaining-life prediction is performed by mixing mode-based life predictions via time-averaged mode probabilities. The solution has the potential to be applicable to a variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to aerospace systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Prognostic Techniques Applied to a Suspension System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2001055","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4604812/04604823.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2001055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604812","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Prognostic Techniques Applied to a Suspension System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4604823/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180024","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Prognostic Techniques Applied to a Suspension System","sourcePdf":"tsmca-luo-2001055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124748S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4604812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"4604812","articleId":"4604823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4604825,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbing Tao","affiliation":["Service Computing Technology and System Laboratory of Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4604812/4604825/4604825-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenbing Tao received the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2004.","Since 2005, he has been with the School of Computer Science and Technology, HUST, where he is currently a Research Associate Professor with the Service Computing Technology and System Laboratory and also with the Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory.

The proposed algorithm uses a normalized graph-cut measure as thresholding principle to distinguish an object from the background. The weight matrices used in evaluating the graph cuts are based on the gray levels of the image, rather than the commonly used image pixels. For most images, the number of gray levels is much smaller than the number of pixels. Therefore, the proposed algorithm requires much smaller storage space and lower computational complexity than other image segmentation algorithms based on graph cuts. This fact makes the proposed algorithm attractive in various real-time vision applications such as automatic target recognition. Several examples are presented, assessing the superior performance of the proposed thresholding algorithm compared with the existing ones. Numerical results also show that the normalized-cut measure is a better thresholding principle compared with other graph-cut measures, such as average-cut and average-association ones.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2001068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4604812/04604825.pdf","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2001068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Thresholding Using Graph Cuts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4604825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604825/","displayDocTitle":"Image Thresholding Using Graph Cuts","volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180033","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4604825/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Thresholding Using Graph Cuts","sourcePdf":"tsmca-tao-2001068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081205S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4604812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4604812","articleId":"4604825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4604833,"authors":[{"name":"Rongming Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rongming","lastName":"Chu","id":"37410099400"},{"name":"Likun Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Likun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37270932000"},{"name":"Nicholas Fichtenbaum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Fichtenbaum","id":"37293972800"},{"name":"David Brown","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Brown","id":"37308064000"},{"name":"Zhen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37577505600"},{"name":"Stacia Keller","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stacia","lastName":"Keller","id":"37270264200"},{"name":"Steven P.

The V-gate GaN HEMTs feature two key technologies: One is the use of an epitaxially grown GaN cap layer to isolate the surface charging from affecting the 2DEG channel; the other one is the adoption of a V-shaped gate-recess geometry that effectively mitigates the electric-field crowding at the gate edge. The combination of these two technologies enables high-voltage and dispersion-free operation without significantly sacrificing the devices' bandwidth. At 10-GHz frequency and 48-V drain bias, the V-gate devices exhibited an output power density of 12.2 W/mm with the associated power added efficiency as high as 65%. This result represents, to date, the highest reported efficiency at this frequency and operating voltage, indicating that the V-gate GaN HEMTs are suitable for X-band power applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4604833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4604833/","accessionNumber":"10180079","displayDocTitle":"V-Gate GaN HEMTs for X-Band Power Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"V-Gate GaN HEMTs for X-Band Power Applications","sourcePdf":"led-chu-2001639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067675S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4604831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4604831","articleId":"4604833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4604845,"authors":[{"name":"Marek Chacinski","affiliation":["Kista Photonic Research Centre, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Chacinski","id":"37402412300"},{"name":"Urban Westergren","affiliation":["Kista Photonic Research Centre, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Urban","lastName":"Westergren","id":"37282060600"},{"name":"Bo Willen","affiliation":["Kista Photonic Research Centre, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Willen","id":"37332208400"},{"name":"Bj\u00d6rn Stoltz","affiliation":["Syntune AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bj\u00d6rn","lastName":"Stoltz","id":"37300471700"},{"name":"Lars Thylen","affiliation":["Kista Photonic Research Centre, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Thylen","id":"37282061400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4604845","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ethernet networks","Bandwidth","Voltage","Optical transmitters","Optical reflection","Design optimization","Optical waveguides","Indium phosphide","Optical modulation","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroabsorption","local area networks","modulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroabsorption modulators","Ethernet","traveling-wave electroabsorption modulator","drive voltages","microwave design segmentation","active modulator length","incident drive voltage","voltage 2 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-speed modulator","optoelectronics","waveguide modulators"]}],"abstract":"The design of a traveling-wave electroabsorption modulator (TWEAM) has been improved to decrease the drive voltage.

Firstly, this paper tries to explain to design complex supported orthogonal wavelets by compactly supported orthogonal real wavelets. Secondly, the extraction of disturbance signal to obtain the feature information is explored. Finally several novel wavelets combined information to analyze the disturbance signal is proposed and is superior to real wavelet analysis result. For power quality disturbance pattern recognition the feature obtained from wavelet transform coefficients are inputted into radial basis function network. The network structure and parameter identification is fulfilled by establishing the power quality disturbance recognition model and using genetic algorithm. When signal representing fault is inputted to the trained network, the type of disturbance can be obtained.

In a view of the inter relationship of wavelet transform and fractal theory, the whole and local fractal exponents obtained from WT coefficients as features are presented for extracting fault signals. The effectiveness of the new algorithm used to extract the characteristic signal is described, which can be realized by the value of the fractal dimensions of those types of short-circuit fault. In accordance with the threshold value of each type of short-circuit fault in each frequency band, the correlation between the type of short-circuit and the fractal dimensions can be figured to perform extraction. This model incorporates the advantages of morphological filter and multi-scale WT to extract the feature of faults meanwhile restraining various noises. Besides, it can be implemented in real time using the available hardware. The effectiveness of this model was verified with the voltage stability analysis of simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605074.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"634","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and analysis of short duration disturbances in power system based on wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Transforms","Fractals","Power systems","Wavelet analysis","Feature extraction","Filter bank"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractals","power system analysis computing","power system faults","short-circuit currents","signal denoising","stability","statistics","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short duration disturbances","power system","wavelet transform","fractal theory","short-circuit fault","voltage stability","signal denoising","statistic rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power system","Voltage stability","Short-circuit frault","Fractal theory","Wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Detection and analysis of short duration disturbances in power system based on wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4605074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10202225","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and analysis of short duration disturbances in power system based on wavelet transform","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"CCC08-0580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04203S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599591","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4604871","articleId":"4605074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Intelligence M&C Technical of KMUST","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4605088,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Biao","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Biao","id":"37088093715"},{"name":"Dong Yanliang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Dong Yanliang","id":"37088094398"},{"name":"Zhao Keding","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Keding","id":"37087170312"},{"name":"Sun Fengying","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Sun Fengying","id":"37088094484"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605088","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Parameter estimation","Load modeling","Force control","Genetics","Dynamics","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","genetic algorithms","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameters identification","passive force control system","genetic algorithm","upper bounds","lower bounds","mathematical model","identification parameters","complex dynamic system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Parameters identification","Passive force control system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605088","abstract":"Using upper and lower bounds of the parameters a genetic algorithm parameters identification method is proposed.

To realize it in optimal control solving problem of a heat transfer system, one must turn the problem to be an optimization. Thus the performance index and governed partial differential equations are discretized in time and spatial variables by using a finite-difference method. The finite time horizon is divided into several intervals and the optimal control law is assumed to be a piecewise-constant function in each interval which is regarded as the gene of the proposed algorithm.

The results of simulation analysis show that the complex wavelet transform combined with wavelet network are more sensitive to signal singularity, and found to be significant improvement over current methods in real-time detection and better noise proof ability.","doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605122","startPage":"486","endPage":"489","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605122.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power quality event detection and recognition using wavelet analysis and intelligent neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Multiresolution analysis","Transforms","Wavelet analysis","Power quality","Power systems","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","pattern recognition","power distribution faults","power engineering computing","power supply quality","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality event detection","wavelet analysis","intelligent neural network","short duration disturbance detection","distribution power system","backpropagation algorithm","orthogonal wavelets","disturbance signal extraction","pattern recognition","trained network","real-time detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex wavelet","Signal detection","Short duration disturbance","Wavelet network","Power system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power quality event detection and recognition using wavelet analysis and intelligent neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4605122/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10202291","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power quality event detection and recognition using wavelet analysis and intelligent neural network","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"CCC08-0698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03714S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599591","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4604871","articleId":"4605122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute Of Intelligence M&C Technical Of KMUST","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4605123,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Hua","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Liu Hua","id":"37687662400"},{"name":"Zhao Baoqun","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Baoqun","id":"37681776700"},{"name":"Zhang Hong","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Hong","id":"37692756400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605123","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Wavelet transforms","Power systems","Multiresolution analysis","Voltage fluctuations","Transforms","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","genetic algorithms","power supply quality","signal classification","signal denoising","signal detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power industry","power electronics devices","power distribution network","power quality disturbance detection","voltage waveform","signal denoising","wavelet transform","wavelet network","genetic algorithm","power quality recognition","power quality classification","singularity detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power quality disturbance","Wavelet transform","Signal de-noise","Singularity detection","Short duration disturbance","Power system"]}],"abstract":"Power quality (PQ) is becoming prevalent and of critical importance for power industry recently. The fast expansion in use of power electronics devices led to a wide diffusion of nonlinear, time-variant loads in the power distribution network, which cause massive serious power quality problems. The quantitative detection of two distortions of voltage waveform, i.e., voltage sag and voltage swell, is conducted and on this base a novel approach based on wavelet transform (WT) to detect and locate the PQ disturbances is proposed. The signal containing noise is de-noised by wavelet transform to obtain a signal with higher signal-to-noise ratio, and then is input to the wavelet network; the standard genetic algorithm is used to fulfill the network structure; the fundamental component of the signal is estimated to extract the mixed information using wavelet network, and then the disturbance is acquired by subtracting the fundamental component; the principle of singularity detection using WT modulus maxima is presented and a dyadic wavelet transform approach for the detection and localization of the power quality disturbance is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.","doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605123","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605123.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition and classification of power quality event in power system using wavelet transformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605123/","displayDocTitle":"Recognition and classification of power quality event in power system using wavelet transformation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10202292","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4605123/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition and classification of power quality event in power system using wavelet transformation","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"CCC08-0699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040242S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599591","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4604871","articleId":"4605123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute Of Intelligence M&C Technical Of KMUST","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4605152,"authors":[{"name":"Na Jing","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Na Jing","id":"37087648546"},{"name":"Ren Xuemei","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ren Xuemei","id":"37087433602"},{"name":"Chen Qiang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chen Qiang","id":"37087168222"},{"name":"Xu Jiping","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xu Jiping","id":"37087648386"},{"name":"Gao Yan","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Gao Yan","id":"37087475361"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605152","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Adaptive systems","Control systems","Temperature control","Prediction algorithms","Mathematical model","Taylor series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","compensation","control system analysis","delay systems","delays","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","predictive control","stability criteria","state estimation","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive high-order neural network state predictor","nonlinear time-delay system","identification model","system state feedback prediction","time-delay compensation","closed-loop system","stability analysis","Lyapunov stability criterion","temperature control system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-delay system","Neural network","Adaptive identification","Nonlinear predictor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605152","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605152.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","startPage":"638","endPage":"643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive neural network state predictor for nonlinear time-delay systems","abstract":"A new adaptive nonlinear state predictor (ANSP) is presented for a class of nonlinear systems with input time-delay.

optimization based on multi-objective optimization model for coking plant production","abstract":"In coking plant production process of an iron and steel enterprise, the target flue temperature, gas collector pressure and coking time are set by human experience. Itpsilas difficult to adjust them timely according to different conditions, so the anticipant integrated production target canpsilat be reached. In order to solve this problem, a basic optimization idea is proposed, which is with the maximum of coke yield and minimum of energy consumption as the optimization objective and with coke quality and technological requirements as the constraint conditions. Firstly, the multiple linear regression and improved BP neural network methods are used to build a multi-objective optimization model with nonlinear inequality constraints for coking plant production process. Then, the linear weighted sum method and GRG combinatorial algorithm are applied to resolve the multi-objective optimization problem, so as to obtain the optimized target values of flue temperature, gas collector pressure and coking time. Actual application results show that the optimized result by method proposed in this paper can better meet the enterprise needs, and the industrial application effect is good.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605196/","accessionNumber":"10183887","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Process optimization based on multi-objective optimization model for coking plant production","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process optimization based on multi-objective optimization model for coking plant production","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"CCC08-0890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037533S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","articleId":"4605196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4605202,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Fuchun","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Liu Fuchun","id":"37087286338"},{"name":"Yao Yu","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yao Yu","id":"37087214727"},{"name":"He Fenghua","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"He Fenghua","id":"37087285998"},{"name":"Ji Denggao","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Ji Denggao","id":"37087286414"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605202","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605202","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Uncertainty","Linear matrix inequalities","Linear systems","Control systems","Output feedback","Uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","matrix algebra","robust control","sampled data systems","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust guaranteed cost control","time-varying norm-bounded parametric uncertainties","state matrix","input matrix","causal dynamic output feedback sampled-data controller","asymptotical stability","closed-loop system","quadratic performance index","linear matrix inequalities","LMI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampled-data System","Uncertain System","Guaranteed Cost Control","Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of robust guaranteed control for sampled-data systems with time-varying norm-bounded parametric uncertainties in the state matrix and input matrix.

In order to the performance evaluation of damping controllers of a power system, the considered system is modeled as a two-layer multi-agent system. The first layer is the device layer, which includes the generator and its associated controllers, and the second layer is the information layer, which is composed of the information agents, exchanging the information based on the wide area measurement system (WAMS) and sending the control signals to the power system stabilizers (PSSs). In the light of the proposed model, an index is presented to evaluate the performance of damping controllers to the system\u2019s inter-area oscillation with certain structures of the information interconnection layer. The index is corresponding to an optimal problem which minimize the distance of the special eigenvalue with respect to the image axis with fixed information layer structure. Furthermore, the impact of information interconnection structure on the damping performance is addressed. Finally, the simulation results in the 2-area 4-generator power system show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605501","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605501.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation for damping controllers of power systems based on multi-layermulti-agent systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation for damping controllers of power systems based on multi-layermulti-agent systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4605501/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10184036","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605501/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation for damping controllers of power systems based on multi-layermulti-agent systems","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"CCC08-1601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046907S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599591","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","xplore-issue":"4604871","articleId":"4605501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute Of Intelligence M&C Technical Of KMUST","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4605504,"authors":[{"name":"Li Hongyan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronic Science, Hubei University of Economics, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Li Hongyan","id":"37087727922"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605504","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"abstract":"Due to the bandwidth constraint, the network inevitably induces time delay in the Internet-based control system, which will affect the performance of Internet-based closed-loop control systems such as performance degradation and system destabilization. The variable-rate sampling strategy is proposed based on the proposed dual closed-loops control architecture to overcome the uncertain transmission time-delay influencing the dynamic performance of Internet-based control systems. The local closed-loop control is running at a higher frequency to stabilize the plant, the remote closed-loop control at a lower variable-rate sampling frequency to reduce the communication load and increase the possibility of receiving data on time. To deal with large Internet time-delay and data loss fully, the time-delay compensator is designed based on predictive controller. The effectiveness of the proposed compensation strategy is illustrated by simulation study.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Delay effects","Control systems","Delay","Process control","Frequency control","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","compensation","delays","Internet","predictive control","stability","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-rate sampling compensation control","Internet-based remote control system","bandwidth constraint","performance degradation","system destabilization","uncertain transmission time-delay","variable-rate sampling frequency","time-delay compensator","predictive controller","closed-loop control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time delay","Control system","Variable-rate sampling strategy","Predictive controller"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605504","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605504.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-rate sampling compensation control for Internet-based remote control system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variable-rate sampling compensation control for Internet-based remote control system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605504/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4605504/","accessionNumber":"10184039","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-rate sampling compensation control for Internet-based remote control system","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"CCC08-1608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050082S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599591","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","xplore-issue":"4604871","articleId":"4605504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute Of Intelligence M&C Technical Of KMUST","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4605523,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yongqing","affiliation":["School of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China","School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"lastName":"Yang Yongqing","id":"37087393212"},{"name":"Cao Jinde","affiliation":["School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"lastName":"Cao Jinde","id":"37087430114"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605523","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Delay","Artificial neural networks","Chaotic communication","Chaos","Stability analysis","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","chaos","delay systems","differential equations","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive synchronization","chaotic neural networks","stability analysis","impulsive differential equations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Synchronization","Impulse","Adaptive control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605523","abstract":"In the paper, the synchronization of a class of chaotic neural networks with delay and impulse is investigated.

The detected edge image is well localized, and thin, and robust to noise.","doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605754","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605754.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"591","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An edge detection method based on good point set genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An edge detection method based on good point set genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10183923","publicationDate":"July 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An edge detection method based on good point set genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"CCC08-2203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030979S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4605754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4605791,"authors":[{"name":"He Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"He Xiao","id":"37087164067"},{"name":"Wang Zidong","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Uxbridge, UK"],"lastName":"Wang Zidong","id":"37087484442"},{"name":"Zhou Donghua","affiliation":["Department of Automation, TsingHua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Donghua","id":"37087494625"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605791","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605791","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Robustness","Filtering theory","Delay","Maximum likelihood detection","Kalman filters","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay systems","filtering theory","linear matrix inequalities","nonlinear systems","robust control","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMI-based robust filtering","time-delay systems","stochastic systems","nonlinear systems","multiobjective robust filtering","conservatism reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust filtering","Linear matrix inequality","Time delay dependent","Parameter dependent","Multi-objective filtering"]}],"abstract":"A review of the recent developments of LMI-based robust filtering problems is presented, which include robust filtering problems for time-delay systems, stochastic systems, nonlinear systems, as well as multi-objective robust filtering problems.

The adjustable fuzzy power control architecture is employed to adaptively control the transmission power and select the suitable transmission rate in the uplink transmission. Unlike the conventional power control mechanisms, the proposed power control architecture can dynamically adjust the membership function of the fuzzy system by the input signal-to-interference (SIR) error and the error change. The adjustment of the membership function can improve the system performance in a time-varying fading channel. In addition, the conventional Lagrangian relaxation method and the fuzzy power control architecture with fixed membership function were evaluated by computer simulations. According to the simulation results, the adjustable fuzzy power control architecture achieves a smaller outage probability and has a higher average transmission rate than those of the prior power control architectures in a wireless fading channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adjustable fuzzy power control architecture for a multi-rate WCDMA system","publicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605817","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 27th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599591/4604871/04605817.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2008.4605817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4605817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An adjustable fuzzy power control architecture for a multi-rate WCDMA system","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4605817/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10184135","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adjustable fuzzy power control architecture for a multi-rate WCDMA system","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"CCC08-2365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058224S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599591","isNumber":"4604871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599591","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4604871","articleId":"4605817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute Of Intelligence M&C Technical Of KMUST","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4605827,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Yaoqun","affiliation":["Institute of System Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xu Yaoqun","id":"37087456465"},{"name":"He Shaoping","affiliation":["Institute of System Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"He Shaoping","id":"37087457046"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-900719-70-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4605827","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Artificial neural networks","Optimization","Neurons","Physics","Electronic mail","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bifurcation","chaos","combinatorial mathematics","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","optimisation","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier chaotic neural network","combinational optimization","sigmoid activation function","nonmonotonous activation function","trigonometric function","reversed bifurcation","maximum Lyapunov exponent","dynamic system","neuron model","function optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-monotonous activation function","Chaotic neural network","Lyapunov exponent","TSP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4605827","abstract":"Chaotic neural network has been proved to be a powerful tool to solve combinational optimization problems.

Then a new planning strategy based on azimuth variation of flight path in horizontal plane was adopted. It takes into account of minimal path step and minimal turning radius. At last a satisfying flight path was obtained by using genetic algorithm and geometry computation. The cost function of the algorithm is about distance, threat and height.

Because electric motors use about 70% of the total industrial electricity use, they present attractive opportunities to save a huge amount of electricity in a cost- effective way, and contribute to mitigate climate change. The lack of global efficiency classes has prevented the large-scale adoption of high efficiency motors in most countries around the world. This paper addresses the most relevant electric motor efficiency-related international standards, including minimum efficiency requirements and a new efficiency classification standard, which have a profound impact on motor market transformation, being a powerful tool to reduce electric motor systems consumption. Moreover, the final results and conclusions of a European study to identify and recommend ways to improve the life-cycle environmental performance of electric motors at their design phase are presented, focusing life- cycle cost assessment of standard and best available electric motor technologies. It was found that if high efficiency or premium class motors replace standard efficiency class motors, significant reductions in the environmental impact will be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICPS.2008.4606292","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPS.2008.4606292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606268","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599590/4606268/04606292.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric motor standards, ecodesign and global market transformation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606292/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Electric motor standards, ecodesign and global market transformation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606292/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10181648","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric motor standards, ecodesign and global market transformation","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"ICPS08XP20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074419S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599590","isNumber":"4606268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599590","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4606268","articleId":"4606292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4606293,"authors":[{"name":"Ed Larsen","affiliation":["Square D Company, Cedar Rapids, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4599590/4606268/4606293/4606293-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ed Larsen (M'79-SM'07) is the Industry Standards Manager for Circuit Protection for Square D/Schneider Electric and has over 30 years of experience in the electrical industry.

A new way for system designers to evaluate the level of selective coordination between low- voltage circuit breakers is introduced, indicating that higher levels of coordination can be achieved than those shown by the use of time-current curves alone.","doi":"10.1109/ICPS.2008.4606293","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599590/4606268/04606293.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPS.2008.4606293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to low-voltage circuit breaker short-circuit selective coordination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606293/","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to low-voltage circuit breaker short-circuit selective coordination","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10181649","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606293/","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to low-voltage circuit breaker short-circuit selective coordination","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"ICPS08XP21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026962S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599590","isNumber":"4606268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599590","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4606268","articleId":"4606293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4606297,"authors":[{"name":"W.

However, a PHIL simulation may result in errors or even instability due to imperfections (e.g., time delay, noise injection, phase lag, limited bandwidth) in the power interface, especially in high power applications. Additionally, it is usually difficult to determine the accuracy of a simulation because there is no reference available for people to know the ldquoshould-berdquo system responses in advance. Therefore, a method is demanded to predict the accuracy of PHIL simulations. In this paper, an effective method for evaluating the PHIL accuracy is proposed. This method provides a means to justify the result of a PHIL simulation analytically and quantitatively instead of empirically. While the method is based on linear system analysis, it is shown to be also applicable for nonlinear PHIL systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Integrated circuit modeling","Transfer functions","Computational modeling","Hardware","Load modeling","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","network synthesis","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power hardware-in-the-loop simulations","high power application","PHIL simulation","linear system analysis","nonlinear PHIL systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation","interface perturbation","simulation accuracy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPS.2008.4606297","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599590/4606268/04606297.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPS.2008.4606297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective method for evaluating the accuracy of Power Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An effective method for evaluating the accuracy of Power Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606297/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606297/","accessionNumber":"10181652","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective method for evaluating the accuracy of Power Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"ICPS08XP25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06375S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599590","isNumber":"4606268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599590","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4606268","articleId":"4606297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4606334,"authors":[{"name":"Rabin Raut","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Rabin","lastName":"Raut","id":"37276705200"},{"name":"Omidreza Ghasemi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Omidreza","lastName":"Ghasemi","id":"37569613200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2331-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2332-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4606334","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Optical fiber amplifiers","CMOS technology","Impedance","Impedance matching","Integrated circuit modeling","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low-power electronics","VLSI","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide band trans-impedance amplifier","CMOS integrated circuit technology","VLSI technological process","power consumption","size 0.18 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606334","abstract":"This article proposes a simple trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) using a given (i.e. 0.18 micron CMOS) VLSI technological process.

For this purpose, some assumptions are made. The MTJ model is separated in two entities. The first one concerns the magnetization of a ferromagnetic thin film. The other focuses on the electrical conduction of a MTJ. Both models are implemented and coupled in VHDL-AMS in order to obtain the compact model of a MTJ, which is parameterized with 25 values (19 physical parameters and 6 semi-empirical ones). The first simulations are encouraging. They allow to retrieve classical results on MTJ and to predict interesting behaviors.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606363","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4600187/4606305/04606363.pdf","startPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact modeling of magnetic tunnel junction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606363/","displayDocTitle":"Compact modeling of magnetic tunnel junction","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10184492","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606363/","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact modeling of magnetic tunnel junction","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073715S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4600187","isNumber":"4606305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4600187","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4606305","articleId":"4606363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4606364,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Rivet","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, Universite de Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Rivet","id":"37403070000"},{"name":"Yann Deval","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, Universite de Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Deval","id":"37277062400"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Begueret","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, Universite de Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Begueret","id":"37276436400"},{"name":"Dominique Dallet","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, Universite de Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Dallet","id":"37273699400"},{"name":"Philippe Cathelin","affiliation":["Central Research & Development, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Cathelin","id":"37403070500"},{"name":"Didier Belot","affiliation":["Central Research & Development, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Belot","id":"37268139100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2331-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2332-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4606364","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay lines","Transistors","Delay","Capacitors","RF signals","Charge transfer","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue processing circuits","cellular radio","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","MMIC","software radio","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS circuit design","sampled analog signal processor","RF applications","software-defined radio","SDR","noncellular standards","mobile terminal","fast Fourier transform","FFT","size 65 nm","frequency 0 GHz to 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog signal processing","software-defined radio","cognitive radio","sampled analog signal processor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606364","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606305","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4600187/4606305/04606364.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"65nm CMOS Circuit design of a sampled analog signal processor dedicated to RF applications","abstract":"The software-defined radio (SDR) concept aims at designing a re-configurable radio architecture accepting all cellular or non-cellular standards working in the 0-5 GHz frequency range.

It exposes the failure mechanisms that occur when a PA under extreme conditions (high battery voltage and high input power) is exposed to impedance mismatches at its output. Protection against high voltage operation is addressed by integrating a parallel base resistor which increases significantly emitter collector breakdown. A current sensor is then associated to a feedback loop on the PA biasing circuit that operates when the PA is in high dissipated power conditions by limiting the collector current. These protections are easily implemented on the PA die without any extra area. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of these principles: the protection is indexed on the collector supply voltage and acts for all output loads leading to VSWR up to 1 0:1, whereas output power and power efficiency on a 50 Omega load are not affected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606366/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10184494","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A protection circuit for HBT RF Power Amplifier under load mismatch conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A protection circuit for HBT RF Power Amplifier under load mismatch conditions","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047774S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4600187","isNumber":"4606305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4600187","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4606305","articleId":"4606366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4606367,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Jabbour","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS-UMR 5141-Institut, TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Jabbour","id":"37543114400"},{"name":"David Camarero","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS-UMR 5141-Institut, TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Camarero","id":"37569727200"},{"name":"Van Tan Nguyen","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS-UMR 5141-Institut, TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"lastName":"Van Tan Nguyen","id":"37088098626"},{"name":"Patrick Loumeau","affiliation":["LTCI-CNRS-UMR 5141-Institut, TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Loumeau","id":"37265088100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2331-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2332-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4606367","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":224},"abstract":"A technique for optimizing the number of channels for time-interleaved sample-and-hold is proposed.

Constructed from shifted identity matrices, the first advantage of the proposed codes is that these codes are particularly well-suitable for the high-speed implementation of parallel encoders and parallel decoders. Since a unique mother parity check matrix is used to construct LDPC codes with several code rates, the second great advantage of the proposed codes is that a single universal encoder (decoder) is adequate to encode (decode) multi-rate codes, which makes it possible to efficiently implement multi-rate LDPC codes in a subscriber station. The implementation results into field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices indicate that a universal parallel encoder for LDPC codes with 9 code rates is capable of reaching a throughput above 3.6 Gigabit per second by using a clock frequency of 300 MHz and consuming only 1% of the total resources in a typical FPGA device.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606368","startPage":"249","endPage":"252","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4600187/4606305/04606368.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed design of adaptive LDPC codes for wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606368/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"High-speed design of adaptive LDPC codes for wireless networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10184496","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606368/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed design of adaptive LDPC codes for wireless networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050517S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4600187","isNumber":"4606305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4600187","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4606305","articleId":"4606368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4606369,"authors":[{"name":"Shuli Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Shuli Gao","id":"38339600400"},{"name":"Noureddine Chabini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Chabini","id":"38329966700"},{"name":"Dhamin Al-Khalili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Dhamin","lastName":"Al-Khalili","id":"38277818000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2331-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2332-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4606369","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Adders","Delay","Organizations","Algorithm design and analysis","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multigranular embedded DSP blocks","large-size signed multipliers","sign-extension scheme","execution delay","Quartus II software tool","Altera Stratix II FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient design methodology for implementing a large-size signed multiplier using multi-granular embedded blocks.

Understanding the relations between circuit structure and its reliability allows the designer to implement some tradeoffs that can improve the resulting design. This work presents a probabilistic model that computes the reliability of combinational logic circuits relating to single and multiple faults. The methodology is targeted (but not limited) to circuits generated by synthesis tools, and standard cell based implementation. To validate the proposed methodology we have studied the reliability of some adder structures. Complexity and scalability of the model are discussed and some optimizations are presented.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606383","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint 6th International IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems and TAISA Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4600187/4606305/04606383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2008.4606383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606305","startPage":"310","endPage":"313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability analysis of combinational circuits based on a probabilistic binomial model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliability analysis of combinational circuits based on a probabilistic binomial model","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606383/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10184506","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606383/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability analysis of combinational circuits based on a probabilistic binomial model","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069053S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4600187","isNumber":"4606305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4600187","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4606305","articleId":"4606383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4606394,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Delorme","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Delorme","id":"37681718300"},{"name":"Jerome Martin","affiliation":["CEA LETI, MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Martin","id":"37535187000"},{"name":"Amor Nafkha","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Amor","lastName":"Nafkha","id":"37281704900"},{"name":"Christophe Moy","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Moy","id":"37294411000"},{"name":"Fabien Clermidy","affiliation":["CEA LETI, MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Clermidy","id":"37319020600"},{"name":"Pierre Leray","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Leray","id":"37667093300"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37269478700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2331-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2332-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4606394","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":677},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","IP networks","Hardware","System-on-a-chip","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","field programmable gate arrays","network-on-chip","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","partial reconfiguration design","cognitive radio","NoC architecture","radio platform evolution","communication modules","heterogeneous reconfigurable hardware platform","software defined radio","NoC design","E2RII project","IDROMEL project"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NoC","SoC","SDR","partial reconfiguration","telecommunication","FPGA","ASIC","ICAP"]}],"abstract":"A cognitive radio is the final point of software-defined radio platform evolution : a fully reconfigurable radio that changes its communication modules depending on network and/or user demands. His definition on reconfigurability is very broad and we only focus on the heterogeneous reconfigurable hardware platform for cognitive radio. software defined radio (SDR) basically refers to a set of techniques that permit the reconfiguration of a communication system without the need to change any hardware system element. The goal of Software Defined Radio is to produce communication devices which can support several different services. These terminals must adapt their hardware structure in function of the wireless networks such as GSM, UMTS, wireless LAN standards like IEEE 802.11a/b/g As a consequence, NoC offer good perspectives to future SoC in the way to satisfy SDR concept. Conception, validation and evaluation of solutions for NoC design (mapping of cores, topology, FIFO and link sizes) is conducted through simulations.

In this paper, we firstly define the entropy-based analysis, then analyze the amount of incoming packets to our collage. As the results, we were able to extract the following features for the entropy analysis. Firstly, fluctuations for first octet aggregation lead to similar pattern compared to that of first and second octets aggregation. Secondly, sliding time of 10 minutes of entropy window was sensitive to detect anomaly accesses. Finally, differential entropy detected the small amount of 80/TCP anomaly accesses while analysis of frequency was hard to find that.","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2008.60","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4606617/4606618/04606674.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2008.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606618","startPage":"141","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of Characteristics of Anomaly Accessed IP Packets by the Entropy-Based Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of Characteristics of Anomaly Accessed IP Packets by the Entropy-Based Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606674/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 March 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10183001","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606674/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of Characteristics of Anomaly Accessed IP Packets by the Entropy-Based Analysis","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3109a141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051214S","chronDate":"4-7 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4606617","isNumber":"4606618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4606617","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4606618","articleId":"4606674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4606678,"authors":[{"name":"Alakananda Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Alakananda","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37651530100"},{"name":"Amit Konar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Konar","id":"37299656200"},{"name":"Swagatam Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Swagatam","lastName":"Das","id":"38598899800"},{"name":"Crina Grosan","affiliation":["Babes Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Crina","lastName":"Grosan","id":"37282607100"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Quantifiable Quality of Service, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37297713700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3109-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4606678","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Hardware","Partitioning algorithms","Software algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Embedded system","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","hardware-software codesign","integer programming","linear programming","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware software partitioning problem","embedded system design","particle swarm optimization algorithm","performance analysis","integer linear programming","genetic algorithm","ant colony optimization","computer simulations","meta-heuristic techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Hardware/Software Partitioning","Integer Linear Programming","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606678","abstract":"Hardware/software partitioning is a crucial problem in embedded system design.

Information marketplaces can be considered as places where users search and retrieve information goods. Such places appear to be very interesting information retrieval models. Furthermore, software agent technology could help users and providers to work in such open environments providing a variety of advantages. Users as well as information providers could be represented by intelligent agents that work autonomously. The representatives of users assume the role of information buyers while the representatives of information sources could be referred to as sellers. In this paper, we examine a scenario where agents representing entities involved in an information marketplace bargain over the prices of information goods. Bargaining originates in game theory (GT). The rationale is that some entities contest to gain as much profit as possible in an open environment. We study the sellerspsila side. Sellers involved in a number of games with buyers, are trying to achieve as greater prices as possible in order to gain more profit from each game. We present a theoretical model of deadline computation for which sellers are participating in the game. Over this time limit it is useless for sellers to continue the game while buyers reject the proposed prices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606680/","conferenceDate":"4-7 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 March 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10183552","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606680/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Implicit Deadline Calculation for Seller Agent Bargaining in Information Marketplaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implicit Deadline Calculation for Seller Agent Bargaining in Information Marketplaces","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3109a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077663S","chronDate":"4-7 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4606617","isNumber":"4606618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4606617","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4606618","articleId":"4606680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4606693,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Vitabile","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Legale, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Vitabile","id":"37267052200"},{"name":"Salvatore Bono","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Bono","id":"37701018900"},{"name":"Filippo Sorbello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Sorbello","id":"37267055400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3109-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4606693","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"abstract":"Automatic vehicle driving involves several issues, such as the capability to follow the road and keep the right lane, to maintain the distance between vehicles, to regulate vehiclepsilas speed, to find the shortest route to a destination.

According to the superstatistics theory, the complex dynamic system may have a large fluctuationary of intensive quantities on large time scales which causes the system to behave as nonstationarity and nonlinearity which are also the characteristics of network traffic flows. This new idea provides us a novel way to partition the nonstationary traffic time series into small stationary segments which can be modeled by Poisson distribution in sub-second time scales. Different segments follow Poisson distribution with different distribution parameters which are named slow changing parameter compared to the fast changing traffic flows and the series of distribution parameter follows certain distribution too.

To distinguish between the normal traffic and anomalous traffic we calculate hurst parameter of slow changing parameter.

The complexity of the experimental test platforms employed by these institutions have also increased over the years, supporting greater numbers of antennas while providing even more real-time computational processing power. These tremendous increases in capability, however, come at a very steep price which the vast majority of the wireless research community cannot afford.

In this paper, we propose a novel orthogonal projection scheme to extract spatial interference structure for the blind beamformer, which requires neither the direction of the desired signal nor the array geometry information. Exploiting more signal-free interference samples makes the convergence of the beamformer fast and independent of the desired signal strength. Simulation results demonstrate its better interference suppression ability than the pre- and post- correlation (PAPC) scheme and the filter pair (FP) scheme. Furthermore, the proposed recursive algorithm can null the newly entering interferers within a few symbols, making it suitable for dynamic multiple access channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An orthogonal projection based blind beamformer for DS-CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606819","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606819.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An orthogonal projection based blind beamformer for DS-CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606819/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183048","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An orthogonal projection based blind beamformer for DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569098771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058632S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4606820,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Won Choi","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jun Won","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405961800"},{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Byonghyo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37089094258"},{"name":"Andrew C.

The computations needed for the tree search in the ML decoding is simplified by reducing the dimension of the search space prior to the tree search. In order to compensate performance loss due to the dimension reduction, a list stack algorithm (LSA) is considered, which produces a list of the top K closest points. The combination of both approaches, called reduced dimension list stack algorithm (RD-LSA), is shown to provide flexibility and offers a performance-complexity trade-off. Simulations performed for V-BLAST transmission demonstrate that significant complexity reduction can be achieved compared to the sphere decoding algorithm (SDA) while keeping the performance loss below an acceptable level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606820/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183049","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity near-ML decoding technique via reduced dimension list stack algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity near-ML decoding technique via reduced dimension list stack algorithm","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569099967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054738S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4606821,"authors":[{"name":"Veria Havary-Nassab","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Veria","lastName":"Havary-Nassab","id":"38270688500"},{"name":"Shahram Shahbazpanahi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Shahbazpanahi","id":"37273468400"},{"name":"Ali Grami","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Grami","id":"37284153600"},{"name":"Alex B.

Unlike many traditional DOA estimators, the MMSE approach, denoted as Re-Iterative Super-Resolution (RISR), does not employ spatial sample covariance information which may significantly degrade DOA estimation if spatially-separated sources are temporally correlated. Instead, RISR is a recursive algorithm that relies on a structured signal covariance matrix comprised of the set of possible spatial steering vectors each weighted by an associated power estimate from the previous iteration. Furthermore, RISR can naturally accommodate prior information on spatially colored noise, does not require knowledge of the number of sources, and can also exploit multiple time samples in a non-coherent manner to improve performance. For low to moderate time sample support, RISR is demonstrated to provide super-resolution performance superior to MUSIC and spatially-smoothed MUSIC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10183058","htmlLink":"/document/4606829/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new framework for direction-of-arrival estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new framework for direction-of-arrival estimation","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569097303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043683S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4606836,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Tingting Liu","id":"37697042200"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jian-Kang Zhang","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Kon Max Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Kon Max Wong","id":"37278682400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2240-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2241-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2282"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-870X"}],"articleNumber":"4606836","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","MIMO","Artificial intelligence","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Correlation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","fading channels","geometric programming","higher order statistics","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal precoder design","MIMO systems","decision feedback receivers","multi-input multi-output communication system","channel state information","wireless communication link","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","flat fading channels","first-order statistics","second-order statistics","average arithmetic mean-squared error","zero-forcing decision feedback detection","nonconvex optimization problem","convex geometrical programming problem","interior point method","transmission channels"]}],"abstract":"For precoder design problems in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication system, perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and the receiver is usually required. However, it is often difficult to provide sufficiently timely and accurate feedback of CSI from the receiver to the transmitter for such designs to be practically viable. In this paper, we consider the optimum design of a precoder for a wireless communication link having M transmitter antennas and N receiver antennas (M < N), in which the channels are assumed to be flat fading and may be correlated. We assume that full CSI is known at the receiver, but only the first- and second-order statistics of the channels are available at the transmitter. Our goal is to come up with an efficient design of the optimal precoder for such a MIMO system by minimizing the average arithmetic mean-squared error (MSE) of zero-forcing decision feedback (ZF-DF) detection subject to a constraint on the total transmitting power. We transform this non-convex optimization problem into a convex geometrical programming problem, which can then be efficiently solved using an interior point method. For the case when the transmission channels are uncorrelated, a closed-form solution of the optimum precoder has been obtained. The superior performance of our MIMO system equipped with the optimum precoder is verified by computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal precoder design for mimo systems using decision feedback receivers","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606836","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606836.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal precoder design for mimo systems using decision feedback receivers","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606836/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183065","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal precoder design for mimo systems using decision feedback receivers","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569097331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08771S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4606838,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The turbo principle is applied to the existing canonical receiver structure including fractionally spaced decision feedback equalization with phase synchronization. The performance of multi-channel equalization and adaptive weight update algorithms are aided by soft information delivered from the channel decoder. The complexity of the proposed scheme is shown to be reasonable for highly reverberant underwater channels since it has linear complexity by the use of the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. Experimental results for data transmission at 41.67 k symbol/s with a carrier frequency of 100 kHz demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative multi-channel equalization and decoding for high frequency underwater acoustic communications","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606839","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606839.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Iterative multi-channel equalization and decoding for high frequency underwater acoustic communications","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606839/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183068","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative multi-channel equalization and decoding for high frequency underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569099075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051435S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4606840,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Via","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Cantabria, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Via","id":"37282021100"},{"name":"Ignacio Santamaria","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Cantabria, Spain"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Santamaria","id":"37265616800"},{"name":"Jesus Perez","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Cantabria, Spain"],"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Perez","id":"37274274400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2240-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2241-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2282"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-870X"}],"articleNumber":"4606840","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new subspace algorithm for blind channel estimation in broadband space-time block coded communication systems","abstract":"In this paper a new subspace method for blind estimation of frequency-selective channels is proposed. Specifically, we consider the case of broadband space-time block coded (STBC) transmissions such as STBC-OFDM, space-frequency block coding (SFBC), or time-reversal STBC. The proposed technique is able to exactly recover the channel within a limited number of data blocks, and its computational complexity is linear in the number of subcarriers or data-block size. Furthermore, it is independent of the specific signal constellation, and therefore it can also be applied when the sources have been precoded to exploit the multipath diversity. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated by means of some numerical examples.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606840.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606840","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606840","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606840","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Receivers","Encoding","Block codes","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","diversity reception","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","broadband space-time block coded communication","STBC-OFDM","space-frequency block coding","frequency-selective channels","signal constellation","multipath diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606840/","displayDocTitle":"A new subspace algorithm for blind channel estimation in broadband space-time block coded communication systems","accessionNumber":"10183069","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606840/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new subspace algorithm for blind channel estimation in broadband space-time block coded communication systems","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569100377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069893S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4606841,"authors":[{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Department of Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"lastName":"Xiqi Gao","id":"37277462600"},{"name":"Bin Jiang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Bin Jiang","id":"37401800700"},{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Li","id":"37406895300"},{"name":"Alex B.

At low snapshots, the sidelobes can get very high due to errors in the array covariance matrix. This degrades the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR). Recently, a robust adaptive beamformer based on worst-case optimization (RAB-WC), has reformulated beamforming as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. It exhibits adaptive interference-rejection capability and robustness against large steering direction errors. However, the sidelobes in RAB-WC are indirectly controlled by a regularization factor and it is not clear how the factor value should be selected. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on the use of a set of beampattern shaping constraints. With this framework, the beamformer possesses not only adaptive interference-rejection capability and robustness against large steering direction errors, but also direct sidelobe control simultaneously. Unlike other state-of-the-art robust adaptive beamformers, the proposed beamformer is robust against moving interferences too. The proposed framework is generic and many beamformers can be derived to tackle specific problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606876/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10183620","publicationDate":"July 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606876/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamformers: A beampattern shaping approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamformers: A beampattern shaping approach","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569097021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054606S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4606878,"authors":[{"name":"Chunwei Jethro Lam","affiliation":["Coordinate Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Chunwei Jethro","lastName":"Lam","id":"37270837800"},{"name":"Andrew C.

We apply a Bayesian approach to adaptive beamforming such that the algorithm automatically tunes to the underlying DOA that is not known a priori to the user. The proposed beamformer can be viewed as a weighted mixture of minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers combined according to the data-driven posterior probability density function (PDF) of the DOA. Previous studies use discrete samples to capture the spatial variation of the posterior PDF. In this work, we show that, in case of uniform linear array (ULA), the posterior PDF can be represented as a product of the prior PDF and a number of von Mises PDFpsilas, each approximated by the frequency response of a recursive filter. The beamformer weights can then be computed from the corresponding recursive filtering operations. This leads to an algorithm that preserves the continuity of the parameter space and is capable to resolve any amount of DOA error.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606878","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606878.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606878","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","startPage":"307","endPage":"310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A recursive filter approach to adaptive Bayesian beamforming for unknown DOA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A recursive filter approach to adaptive Bayesian beamforming for unknown DOA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606878/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606878/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183621","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recursive filter approach to adaptive Bayesian beamforming for unknown DOA","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569097413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037492S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4606879,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Jiang","affiliation":["Underwater Acoustic System Laboratory, Hangzhou Applied Acoustics Research Institute, China"],"lastName":"Biao Jiang","id":"37289996400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2240-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2241-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2282"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-870X"}],"articleNumber":"4606879","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606879","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","Loading","Signal to noise ratio","Arrays","Interference","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst-case optimization","robust adaptive beamforming","Lagrangian method","robust adaptive weight vector","steering vector","eigendecomposition","array covariance matrix","root-finding method","diagonal loading-like robust weight vector","robust Capon beamforming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606879","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606879.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity implementation for worst-case optimization-based robust adaptive beamforming","abstract":"In this paper, an efficient low-complexity robust adaptive beamforming method based on worst-case performance optimization is proposed.

Combining the constraint condition and the eigendecomposition of the array covariance matrix, root-finding method is used to obtain the optimal Lagrange multiplier. Then, the diagonal loading-like robust weight vector is achieved. The implementation efficiency is greatly improved since the main computational burden is the eigendecomposition operator.

Traditional estimators based on the eigendecomposition of the sample covariance matrix are known to be consistent provided that the number of observations grow to infinity with respect to any other dimension in the signal model. On the contrary, in order to avoid the loss in the estimation accuracy associated with practical finite sample-size situations, a generalization of the conventional implementation is derived that proves to be a very good approximation for a sample-size and an array dimension that are comparatively large. The proposed solution is applied to the construction of a subspace-based extension of the Capon source power estimator. For our purposes, we resort to the theory of the spectral analysis of large dimensional random matrices, or random matrix theory. As it is shown via numerical simulations, the new estimator turns out to allow for a significantly improved estimation accuracy in practical finite sample-support scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606900/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183640","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the estimation of the covariance eigenspectrum of array sample observations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the estimation of the covariance eigenspectrum of array sample observations","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569097647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044216S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4606908,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri I.

This branch of multi-way signal processing has received increased attention recently which is due to the versatility of the model as well as the identifiability results demonstrating its superiority to matrix-only (2-way) approaches. In R-way PARAFAC analysis, the goal is to decompose an R-dimensional tensor into a minimal sum of rank-1 terms. So far, there exist sub-optimal closed-form solutions as well as iterative techniques for finding these decompositions. However, the latter often require many iterations to converge. In this contribution we demonstrate that the R-way PARAFAC decomposition can be reduced to a set of simultaneous matrix diagonalization problems. Exploiting the structure of the R-dimensional problem, we obtain several estimates for each of the factors and present a \"best matching\" scheme to select the best estimate for each factor. By means of computer simulations we compare our closed-form solution to an iterative technique and demonstrate the enhanced robustness in critical scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A closed-form solution for multilinear PARAFAC decompositions","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606918","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606918.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A closed-form solution for multilinear PARAFAC decompositions","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4606918/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183096","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A closed-form solution for multilinear PARAFAC decompositions","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569097225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059193S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4606921,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Karfoul","affiliation":["INSERM U642, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Karfoul","id":"37697821600"},{"name":"Laurent Albera","affiliation":["INSERM U642, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Albera","id":"37265595400"},{"name":"Lieven De Lathauwer","affiliation":["Leuven, Subfaculty Science and Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lieven","lastName":"De Lathauwer","id":"37294570700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2240-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2241-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2282"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-870X"}],"articleNumber":"4606921","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4606921","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Sensor arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Equations","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","convergence","higher order statistics","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["canonical decomposition","higher order cumulant arrays","blind underdetermined mixture identification","loading matrix","convergence","Procrustes problem","singular value decomposition"]}],"abstract":"A new family of methods, named 2q-ORBIT (q > 1), is proposed in this paper in order to blindly identify potentially underdetermined mixtures of statistically independent sources.

The latter decomposition is brought back to the decomposition of a third order array whose one loading matrix is unitary. Such a decomposition is then computed by alterning and repeating two schemes until convergence: the first one consists in solving a Procrustes problem while the second one needs to compute the best rank-1 approximation of several q-th order arrays. Computer results show a good efficiency of the proposed methods with respect to classical cumulant-based algorithms especially in the underdetermined case.","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4594629/4606810/04606921.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2008.4606921","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2008.4606921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Canonical decomposition of even higher order cumulant arrays for blind underdetermined mixture identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Canonical decomposition of even higher order cumulant arrays for blind underdetermined mixture identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4606921/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4606921/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10183658","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Canonical decomposition of even higher order cumulant arrays for blind underdetermined mixture identification","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569097491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068715S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4594629","isNumber":"4606810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4594629","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4606810","articleId":"4606921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4606929,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo A.

The international standard MCM benchmark circuit provided by the MCNC group was used to verify the approach. Comparing with the evolutionary algorithms and the deterministic algorithms, experimental results demonstrate that the approach can achieve high fault coverage and short execution time.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2008.4607155","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology & High Density Packaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2008.4607155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4606930","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology & High Density Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599585/4606930/04607155.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on MCM interconnect test generation using ant algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607155/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study on MCM interconnect test generation using ant algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607155/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10205923","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","conferenceDate":"28-31 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on MCM interconnect test generation using ant algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai","sourcePdf":"HP-13 Study on MCM Interconnect Test Generation Using Ant Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimizat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052111S","chronDate":"28-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599585","isNumber":"4606930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599585","xplore-issue":"4606930","articleId":"4607155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4607156,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Lei","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"],"lastName":"Chen Lei","id":"37087152506"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2739-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2740-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4607156","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607156","abstract":"Interconnect test technology has become a bottleneck in the application of Multi-chip Module (MCM), so study on new methods of test generation to acquire better test set is significant.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate multiple-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems with distinct uncertain preference structures. We develop some linear-programming models for dealing with the MAGDM problems, where the information about attribute weights is incomplete, and the decision makers have their preferences on alternatives. The provided preference information can be represented in the following three distinct uncertain preference structures: 1) interval utility values; 2) interval fuzzy preference relations; and 3) interval multiplicative preference relations. We first establish some linear-programming models based on decision matrix and each of the distinct uncertain preference structures and, then, develop some linear-programming models to integrate all three structures of subjective uncertain preference information provided by the decision makers and the objective information depicted in the decision matrix. Furthermore, we propose a simple and straightforward approach in ranking and selecting the given alternatives. It is worth pointing out that the developed models can also be used to deal with the situations where the three distinct uncertain preference structures are reduced to the traditional ones, i.e., utility values, fuzzy preference relations, and multiplicative preference relations. Finally, we use a practical example to illustrate in detail the calculation process of the developed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4623193/04607163.pdf","startPage":"1356","endPage":"1370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAGDM Linear-Programming Models With Distinct Uncertain Preference Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607163/","displayDocTitle":"MAGDM Linear-Programming Models With Distinct Uncertain Preference Structures","volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185923","pubMedId":"18784017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607163/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAGDM Linear-Programming Models With Distinct Uncertain Preference Structures","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb05-xu2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110148S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4623193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4623193","articleId":"4607163","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607214,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong He","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaodong He (xiaohe@microsoft.com) received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 1996, the M.S. degree from the Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia in 2003.

We presented an approach that unifies the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE in a common rational-function form of (25). The exact structure of the rational-function form for each discriminative criterion was derived and studied. While the rational-function form of MMI has been known in the past, we provided the theoretical proof that the similar rational-function form exists for the objective functions of MCE and MPE/MWE. Moreover, we showed that the rational function forms for objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE differ in the constant weighting factors CDT (s1 . . . sR) and these weighting factors depend only on the labeled sequence s1 . . . sR, and are independent of the parameter set - to be optimized. The derived rational-function form for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE allows the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework to be applied directly in discriminative learning. In the past, lack of the appropriate rational-function form was a difficulty for MCE and MPE/MWE, because without this form, the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework cannot be directly applied. Based on the unified rational-function form, in a tutorial style, we derived the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization formulas for both discrete HMMs and CDHMMs in discriminative learning using MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE criteria. The unifying review provided in this article has been based upon a large number of earlier contributions that have been cited and discussed throughout the article. Here we provide a brief summary of such background work. Extension to large-scale speech recognition tasks was accomplished in the work of [59] and [60]. The dissertation of [47] further improved the MMI criterion to that of MPE/MWE. In a parallel vein, the work of [20] provided an alternative approach to that of [41], with an attempt to more rigorously provide a CDHMM model re-estimation formula that gives positive growth of the MMI objective function. A crucial error of this attempt was corrected in [2] for establishing an existence proof of such positive growth. The main goal of this article is to provide an underlying foundation for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE at the objective function level to facilitate the development of new parameter optimization techniques and to incorporate other pattern recognition concepts, e.g., discriminative margins [66], into the current discriminative learning paradigm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2008","publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180264","htmlLink":"/document/4607214/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative learning in sequential pattern recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative learning in sequential pattern recognition","sourcePdf":"25msp05-he.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112756S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4607202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4607202","articleId":"4607214","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4607215,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Pancaldi","affiliation":["Electronic engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Fabrizio Pancaldi (fpancaldi@unimore.it) received the Dr.Ing, degree in electronic engineering (cum laude) and the Ph.D. degree in 2006, both from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy.

The target audience of this article include both theory- and practice-oriented researchers who would like to design accurate channel models for evaluating the performance of wireless communication systems in the physical or media access control layers, or those who would like to develop more efficient and reliable transceivers that take advantage of the inherent memory in fading channels. Both FSMC models and flat-fading channels will be formally introduced. FSMC models are particulary suitable to represent and estimate the relatively fast flat-fading channel gain in each subcarrier.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4607202/04607216.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2008.926683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.926683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-state Markov modeling of fading channels - a survey of principles and applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Telephony","Circuits","Wireless communication","Power capacitors","Channel capacity","Error analysis","Communication channels","History","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-state Markov modeling","FSMC","fading channels","wireless communication system","frequency selective channels","transceivers","media access control","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Finite-state Markov modeling of fading channels - a survey of principles and applications","volume":"25","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4607216/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2008","accessionNumber":"10180266","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-state Markov modeling of fading channels - a survey of principles and applications","sourcePdf":"25msp05-sadeghi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171282S","chronDate":"September  2008","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4607202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"296","xplore-issue":"4607202","articleId":"4607216","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4607217,"authors":[{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, US"],"bio":{"p":["Osvaldo Simeone (osvaldo.simeone@njit.edu) received his Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2005.

The competition among groups of users in different service areas to share the limited amount of bandwidth in the available wireless access networks is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game, and the evolutionary equilibrium is considered to be the solution to this game. We present two algorithms, namely, population evolution and reinforcement-learning algorithms for network selection. Although the network-selection algorithm based on population evolution can reach the evolutionary equilibrium faster, it requires a centralized controller to gather, process, and broadcast information about the users in the corresponding service area. In contrast, with reinforcement learning, a user can gradually learn (by interacting with the service provider) and adapt the decision on network selection to reach evolutionary equilibrium without any interaction with other users. Performance of the dynamic evolutionary game-based network-selection algorithms is empirically investigated. The accuracy of the numerical results obtained from the game model is evaluated by using simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","volume":"58","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10601645","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks: An Evolutionary Game Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks: An Evolutionary Game Approach","sourcePdf":"tvt-hossain-2004588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038067S","chronDate":"May  2009","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"316","articleId":"4607241","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4607243,"authors":[{"name":"Wendy Van Moer","affiliation":["Department of Fundamental Electricity and Instrumentation/Toegepaste Wetenschappen (ELEC/TW), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4740169/4607243/4607243-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wendy Van Moer (M'97\u2013SM'07) received the M.Eng. degree in telecommunication and the Ph.D. degree in applied sciences from Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO), Electrical Measurement Department (ELEC), VUB.

The model is based on the concept of the discrete wave impedance of the PML. This concept implies that the wave impedance in the discretized space changes, with respect to the continuous value, when absorption occurs. These changes depend on the absorption per unit length, as well as on the discretization step. In the discretized space, both, the magnitude and phase of wave impedance are modified. We employ numerical simulations obtained using a 1-D code to test the proposed model. We then compare the results with those obtained from coaxial wave guide geometry using a commercial 3-D software package. One important consequence of this modeling scheme is the feasibility of the PML without return losses due to discretization error. In practice, numerical results show that by correctly adjusting the electromagnetic parameters of the PML (electric permittivity and magnetic permeability), a significant improvement in the reflection characteristics is obtained. In some cases, it could be as much as 78 dB. The remaining return losses are successfully explained as second-order effects related to the discontinuity of electromagnetic parameters at the interface between the simulation space and PML.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2002231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4616565/04607252.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2002231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616565","startPage":"2076","endPage":"2085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Physical Modeling of Discretization Error in 1-D Perfectly Matched Layers Using Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Physical Modeling of Discretization Error in 1-D Perfectly Matched Layers Using Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185830","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4607252/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Physical Modeling of Discretization Error in 1-D Perfectly Matched Layers Using Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","sourcePdf":"tmtt-lopezvillegas-2002231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082815S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4616565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4616565","articleId":"4607252","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607256,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wu","affiliation":["Infineon Technology, Villach, Austria","Electrical and Optical Communication Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4616565/4607256/4607256-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Wu was born in Shandong, China, in 1973.

One of the major duties for process synchronization is mutual exclusion. In new algorithm, opposite the past algorithms fairness happens. This paper presents a new approach of the race models involving distributed mutual exclusion. Further, concrete applications of these models did not involve variability in the accumulator size or were based on a specific distribution. We show that the distributions of time stamp, time action and the other effective parameters predicted by the neural network competitive models can be solved analytically this problem that be happens in the critical sections. The model can be manipulated and simulated to predict the effects of reward on Hamming and Hopfieldpsilas models curves and speed-accuracy decomposition. In other hand, the major contribution of this paper is the implementation of a learning rule that enables networks based on a race model to learn stimulus-response associations. The model described here can be seen as a reduction of information system and is compatible with a priority learning system. Also, we will consider the non-linear behavior of the competitive models and as a result use this property in distributed systems. Finally, it is possible to use the neural networks as a distributed system pattern, to optimization of fault tolerance, reliability and accessibility related to mutual exclusion and critical section. Thus in the new approach fault tolerance will ascend and centralize and distributed algorithms can use this and based algorithm will be more reliable.","doi":"10.1109/CITISIA.2008.4607340","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599587/4607323/04607340.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"91","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Innovative Technologies in Intelligent Systems and Industrial Applications","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Innovative Technologies in Intelligent Systems and Industrial Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITISIA.2008.4607340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new simulation of distributed mutual exclusion on neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new simulation of distributed mutual exclusion on neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10179770","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4607340/","conferenceDate":"12-13 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new simulation of distributed mutual exclusion on neural networks","confLoc":"Cyberjaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Paper 17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084524S","chronDate":"12-13 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599587","isNumber":"4607323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599587","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4607323","articleId":"4607340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4607356,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Qing Wu","id":"37067990500"},{"name":"Prakash Mukre","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Prakash","lastName":"Mukre","id":"37697696000"},{"name":"Richard Linderman","affiliation":["Rome Site, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Linderman","id":"38241391000"},{"name":"Tom Renz","affiliation":["Rome Site, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Renz","id":"37546698000"},{"name":"Daniel Burns","affiliation":["Rome Site, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Burns","id":"37344044600"},{"name":"Michael Moore","affiliation":["ITT Advanced Engineering and Sciences, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Moore","id":"37589166900"},{"name":"Qinru Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Qinru Qiu","id":"37267088600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607356","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Microprocessors","Mathematical model","Brain modeling","Brain models","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","microprocessor chips","neural chips","optimisation","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","associative neural memory","recall operation","brain-state-in-a-box model","cell broadband engine processor","optimization techniques","BSB recall algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present our work in the implementation and performance optimization of the recall operation of the brain-state-in-a-box (BSB) model on the cell broadband engine processor.

In this paper, we discuss the use of GPUs in approximately the reverse way: to assist in ldquoconverting pictures into numbersrdquo (i.e. computer vision). For graphical operations, GPUs currently provide many hundreds of gigaflops of processing power. This paper discusses how this processing power is being harnessed for image processing and computer vision, thereby providing dramatic speedups on commodity, readily available graphics hardware. A brief review of algorithms mapped to the GPU by using the graphics API for vision is presented. The NVIDIA CUDA programming model is then introduced as a way of expressing program parallelism without the need for graphics expertise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607358/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607358/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10178726","conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using graphics devices in reverse: GPU-based Image Processing and Computer Vision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using graphics devices in reverse: GPU-based Image Processing and Computer Vision","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0000009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048415S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607416,"authors":[{"name":"Veysel Aslantas","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey"],"firstName":"Veysel","lastName":"Aslantas","id":"37540635400"},{"name":"A.

Embedding watermarks in frequency domain can usually be achieved by modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of the transformation coefficients. After embedding process is completed, a number of rounding errors appear due to conversion of real numbers into integers in the process of transformation of image from frequency domain to spatial domain. A population based stochastic optimization technique (PSO) is proposed to correct these rounding errors.

This paper presents a novel learning-based approach to video search reranking by investigating the ranking order information. The proposed approach, called pseudo preference feedback (PPF), automatically discovers an optimal set of pseudo preference pairs from the initial ranked list and learns a reranking model by ranking support vector machines (ranking SVM) based on the selected pairs. We have proved that PPF can be used for any reranking purpose such as video search and concept detection. We conducted comprehensive experiments for both automatic search and concept detection tasks over TRECVID 2006-2007 benchmark, and showed that PPF could gain significant improvements over the baselines.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Detectors","Kernel","Gain","Visualization","Databases","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query processing","search problems","support vector machines","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video search rerank","pseudo preference feedback","learning-based approach","ranking order information","ranking support vector machines","concept detection","automatic search and concept detection","TRECVID 2006-2007 benchmark"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607430","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607430.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to video search rerank via pseudo preference feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to video search rerank via pseudo preference feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607430/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607430/","accessionNumber":"10178853","conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to video search rerank via pseudo preference feedback","confLoc":"Hannover","sourcePdf":"0000297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075057S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4607478,"authors":[{"name":"Haakon Ruser","affiliation":["Netview Technology AS, Norway"],"firstName":"Haakon","lastName":"Ruser","id":"37697712400"},{"name":"Pal Halvorsen","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway","Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],"firstName":"Pal","lastName":"Halvorsen","id":"37298437700"},{"name":"Carsten Griwodz","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway","Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Griwodz","id":"37284315600"},{"name":"Bjorn Hestnes","affiliation":["Telenor Research and Innovation, Norway"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Hestnes","id":"37397215900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607478","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"abstract":"The high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) communication protocol improves downlink performance on mobile networks and is currently being deployed in networks around the world.

Many differently encoded versions of a media file might exist. Our previous work applied distributed source coding not only to distinguish the legitimate diversity of encoded images from tampering but also localize the tampered regions in an image already deemed to be inauthentic. An authentication decoder was supplied with a Slepian-Wolf encoded image projection as authentication data. We extend our scheme to authenticate contrast and brightness adjusted images using an expectation maximization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can distinguish legitimate encodings of authentic contrast and brightness adjusted images from illegitimately modified versions using authentication data of about 100 bytes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607509/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10178638","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607509/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Authenticating contrast and brightness adjusted images using distributed source coding and expectation maximization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Authenticating contrast and brightness adjusted images using distributed source coding and expectation maximization","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0000613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049201S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607515,"authors":[{"name":"Jinrong Zhang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Jinrong Zhang","id":"37697620100"},{"name":"Houqiang Li","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Houqiang Li","id":"37293373400"},{"name":"Chang Wen Chen","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Chang Wen Chen","id":"37280734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607515","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607515","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Pixel","Image coding","Parity check codes","Correlation","Artificial neural networks","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov modeling","LDPC decoding","distributed image coding","image spatial correlation","interimage correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed coding","Markov model","image statistics"]}],"abstract":"We present in this paper a novel distributed image coding scheme by exploiting image spatial correlation via Markov modeling at the decoding end. The exploitation of image statistics at the decoding end allows us to design a simple yet efficient encoder suitable for various energy efficient imaging sensor network applications. Existing distributed coding schemes developed for imaging sensor networks mostly attempt to exploit inter-image correlation. We develop in this research an integration of LDPC decoding and Markov model estimation in order to jointly exploit both inter-image and intra-image correlation. Simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that this Markov model-based approach is able to achieve significant gains over the schemes without Markov model. The simulation results also show that the 2D Markov model is able to achieve additional gains over the 1D Markov model.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607515","endPage":"640","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607515.pdf","startPage":"637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed image coding based on integrated Markov modeling and LDPC decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607515/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed image coding based on integrated Markov modeling and LDPC decoding","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","accessionNumber":"10178644","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4607515/","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed image coding based on integrated Markov modeling and LDPC decoding","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0000637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049836S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4607520,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Hu","affiliation":["MOE-Microsoft Key Laboratory of MCC, Department of EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"lastName":"Yang Hu","id":"37087393064"},{"name":"Mingjing Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mingjing Li","id":"37087146265"},{"name":"Nenghai Yu","affiliation":["MOE-Microsoft Key Laboratory of MCC, Department of EEIS, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Nenghai Yu","id":"37087162181"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607520","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Transforms","Databases","Principal component analysis","Accuracy","Nearest neighbor searches","Indexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image retrieval","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-duplicate image detection","image retrieval","locality-sensitive hashing","metric learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Near-duplicate detection","metric learning","LSH","query expansion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607520","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for near-duplicate image detection, which is an important problem in variety of applications. While in general content based image retrieval, an image could be similar to the query image in infinitely various ways, the ways in which near-duplicate images deviate from the reference image are very limited. Based on this observation, we proposed to use examplar near-duplicate images, which can be obtained automatically, to improve the performance of near-duplicate image retrieval. We first use examplar near-duplicates to learn an effective distance measure and incorporate the learned metric into locality-sensitive hashing to achieve fast retrieval. We then use examplar near-duplicates to automatically expand the query to further improve the retrieval accuracy. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607520","startPage":"657","endPage":"660","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607520.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient near-duplicate image detection by learning from examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient near-duplicate image detection by learning from examples","conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607520/","accessionNumber":"10178668","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607520/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient near-duplicate image detection by learning from examples","confLoc":"Hannover","sourcePdf":"0000657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038635S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4607545,"authors":[{"name":"Shashi Kant","firstName":"Shashi","lastName":"Kant","id":"37296967300"},{"name":"P.S.S.B.K.

In this contribution we present a recently collected database of spontaneous emotional speech in German which is being made available to the research community. The database consists of 12 hours of audio-visual recordings of the German TV talk show ldquoVera am Mittagrdquo, segmented into broadcasts, dialogue acts and utterances. This corpus contains spontaneous and very emotional speech recorded from unscripted, authentic discussions between the guests of the talk show. In addition to the audio-visual data and the segmented utterances we provide emotion labels for a great part of the data. The emotion labels are given on a continuous valued scale for three emotion primitives: valence, activation and dominance, using a large number of human evaluators. Such data is of great interest to all research groups working on spontaneous speech analysis, emotion recognition in both speech and facial expression, natural language understanding, and robust speech recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607572","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607572.pdf","startPage":"865","endPage":"868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Vera am Mittag German audio-visual emotional speech database","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607572/","displayDocTitle":"The Vera am Mittag German audio-visual emotional speech database","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10178756","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607572/","conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Vera am Mittag German audio-visual emotional speech database","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0000865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040088S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607582,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Cheddad","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing & Engineering, University of Ulster, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Cheddad","id":"37282488300"},{"name":"Joan Condell","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing & Engineering, University of Ulster, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Joan","lastName":"Condell","id":"37325966100"},{"name":"Kevin Curran","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing & Engineering, University of Ulster, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Curran","id":"37298709100"},{"name":"Paul Mc Kevitt","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing & Engineering, University of Ulster, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Mc Kevitt","id":"38109296100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607582","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","PSNR","Skin","Chromium","Transforms","Noise","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data encapsulation","image colour analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skin tone based steganography","video files","YCbCr colour space","human colour-response characteristic","additive artificial noise","image distortion","peak-signal-to-noise ratio","difference distortion metrics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607582","abstract":"Previous studies have shown that Steganography tools such as the S-Tools application outperforms counterpart tools in hiding data in the spatial domain.

YCbCr is intended to take advantage of human colour-response characteristics. Results show that our algorithm outperforms both F5 and S-Tools. Moreover, our system demonstrates improved performance in retrieving the hidden data after applying image processing attacks in the form of additive artificial noise. As a performance measurement for image distortion Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which is classified under the difference distortion metrics, can be applied to the Stego images.

Compared with all state-of-the-art designs, our design needs lower working frequency, supports high resolution up to 1080HD and achieves better bit-rate saving.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607615.pdf","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1040","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An H.264/AVC full-mode intra-frame encoder for 1080HD video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Encoding","Engines","Transforms","Quantization","Pixel","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","image sequences","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H.264/AVC","full-mode intra-frame encoder","1080HD video","hardware architecture","data dependency loop","CMOS cell library","video sequences","video coding","size 0.13 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264","Intra frame encoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","displayDocTitle":"An H.264/AVC full-mode intra-frame encoder for 1080HD video","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607615/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10178856","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An H.264/AVC full-mode intra-frame encoder for 1080HD video","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069059S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607630,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Lin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Lin Huang","id":"37087305830"},{"name":"Chung-Hsien Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Hsien Wu","id":"37087208072"},{"name":"Haizhou Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Haizhou Li","id":"38056074100"},{"name":"Chia-Hsin Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Hsin Hsieh","id":"37087305742"},{"name":"Bin Ma","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Bin Ma","id":"37087305833"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607630","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Speech","Accuracy","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Speech processing","Construction industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grammars","graph theory","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised pronunciation grammar","knowledge-based-data-driven approaches","nonnative speech recognition","variation graph construction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607630","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607630.pdf","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised pronunciation grammar growing using knowledge-based and data-driven approaches","abstract":"This study presents a novel approach to unsupervised pronunciation grammar growing for non-native speech recognition.

First, feature-vectors extracted from the clips in the database are grouped into reference clusters using an unsupervised clustering technique. A unit-document co-occurrence matrix is then obtained by quantizing the feature-vectors extracted from the audio clips into the reference clusters. The audio clips are then mapped to a latent perceptual space by the reduced rank approximation of this matrix. The classification experiments are performed in this representation space using corresponding semantic and onomatopoeic labels of the clips. Using the proposed method, classification accuracy of about sixty percent was obtained when tested on the BBC sound effects library using over twenty categories. Having the two labeling schemes together in a single framework makes the classification system more flexible as each scheme addresses the limitation of the other. These aspects are the main motivation of the work presented here.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607691.pdf","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1344","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of sound clips by two schemes: Using onomatopoeia and semantic labels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Acoustics","Labeling","Speech","Music","Databases","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio databases","audio signal processing","database indexing","matrix algebra","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sound clip classification","onomatopoeia","semantic labels","latent perceptual indexing","feature-vectors","database","unsupervised clustering technique","unit-document cooccurrence matrix","audio clips","reduced rank matrix approximation","classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["audio classification","audio representation","indexing","semantic audio","onomatopoeia","latent document analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","displayDocTitle":"Classification of sound clips by two schemes: Using onomatopoeia and semantic labels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4607691/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10178987","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of sound clips by two schemes: Using onomatopoeia and semantic labels","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094155S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607702,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Ebrahimi-Moghadam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Canada"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Ebrahimi-Moghadam","id":"38276492200"},{"name":"Shahram Shirani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Shirani","id":"37270762600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607702","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607702","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Matching pursuit algorithms","Dictionaries","Indexes","Image reconstruction","Redundancy","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","image coding","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-optimal MMSE based joint source/channel decoding","matching pursuit coded image bit-stream","memoryless noisy channel","residual redundancy","source coder output stream","bandwidth efficient method","matching pursuit based image transmission","MMSE decoding formulation","received analysis indices","high quality error concealment","neighboring image blocks","neighboring MP analysis stages","channel noise degradations"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-optimal MMSE based joint source/channel decoding of a matching pursuit coded image bit-stream over a memoryless noisy channel","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1388","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607702","abstract":"Joint source/channel (JSC) decoding based on using the residual redundancy in a source coder output stream is an interesting bandwidth efficient method of reducing the effects of a noisy channel. In this paper, we consider the problem of JSC decoding of a matching pursuit (MP) based image transmission over a memory-less noisy channel. This problem is solved by means of MMSE decoding formulation for a sequence of received analysis indices, and a sub-optimal solution which yields high quality error concealment is devised. The proposed method exploits the residual redundancy that exists in neighboring image blocks as well as the neighboring MP analysis stages to overcome the channel noise degradations with no increase in the required bandwidth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4607702/","accessionNumber":"10178998","displayDocTitle":"Sub-optimal MMSE based joint source/channel decoding of a matching pursuit coded image bit-stream over a memoryless noisy channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-optimal MMSE based joint source/channel decoding of a matching pursuit coded image bit-stream over a memoryless noisy channel","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080719S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4607710,"authors":[{"name":"Matti Ryynanen","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Ryynanen","id":"37351886300"},{"name":"Tuomas Virtanen","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Virtanen","id":"37285488100"},{"name":"Jouni Paulus","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jouni","lastName":"Paulus","id":"37089089785"},{"name":"Anssi Klapuri","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Anssi","lastName":"Klapuri","id":"37332675800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2570-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2571-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4607710","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":321},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607710","abstract":"We propose a method for separating accompaniment from polyphonic music and its karaoke application, both based on automatic melody transcription. First, the method transcribes the lead-vocal melody of an existing polyphonic music piece, where the transcription consists of a MIDI note sequence and a detailed fundamental frequency (F0) trajectory for each note. Based on the note F0 trajectories, the method uses sinusoidal modeling to estimate, synthesize, and remove the lead vocals in the piece, thus producing separated accompaniment of the piece. User sings along with the separated accompaniment similar to karaoke while the user singing can be tuned to the transcribed melody. This will help non-professional singers to produce more appealing karaoke performances. The quality of separated accompaniments was quantitatively evaluated with approximately one hour of polyphonic music, including material from a commercial karaoke DVD.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Music","Trajectory","Lead","Tuning","Real time systems","Signal to noise ratio","DVD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","music"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["karaoke application","automatic melody transcription","polyphonic music","lead vocal melody","MIDI note sequence","fundamental frequency trajectory","sinusoidal modeling","accompaniment separation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2008.4607710","startPage":"1417","endPage":"1420","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599583/4607348/04607710.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2008.4607710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accompaniment separation and karaoke application based on automatic melody transcription","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accompaniment separation and karaoke application based on automatic melody transcription","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10178615","publicationDate":"June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23 June-26 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4607710/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accompaniment separation and karaoke application based on automatic melody transcription","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0611S","chronDate":"June 23 2008-April 26 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599583","isNumber":"4607348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599583","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4607348","articleId":"4607710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4607739,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The results have been compared to the same approach using genetic algorithm (GA) and the widely used DISTBIC algorithm in several practical situations, and found to be superior in most of the cases.

This trend is usually referred to as \"Power-by-Wire\" in the \"More Electric Aircraft\" (MEA) concept and it leads, among others, to the substitution of hydraulic actuators by electro-mechanical actuators (EMA). Its benefits are a decrease in maintenance effort and weight, and an increase in efficiency. However, jamming case obstacles stop the massive use of EMAs in flight-control actuators. The aim herein is to introduce the safety needs of electro-mechanical actuators in aircraft applications, and Its major goal is to present the suitability and reliability of such actuator systems, including electric motors and power converters.","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2008.4607895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/62/4607302/04607895.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2008.4607895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607302","startPage":"19","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable electro-mechanical actuators in aircraft","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliable electro-mechanical actuators in aircraft","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4607895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180243","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable electro-mechanical actuators in aircraft","sourcePdf":"232008--8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042777S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4607302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"88","articleId":"4607895","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4607896,"authors":[{"name":"Yikun Huang","affiliation":["Montana State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yikun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37404519100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"4607896","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Array signal processing","Adaptive arrays","Direction of arrival estimation","Antenna accessories","Standards development","Bandwidth","Radio link","Algorithm design and analysis","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","cognitive radio","direction-of-arrival estimation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiMAX dynamnic beamforming antenna","eight-channel adaptive beamforming antenna","chip-based components","IEEE 802.16d-2004","smart antennas","adaptive antennas","direction of arrival estimation","adaptive tracking","adaptive array","multichannel-multiuser environment","dynamic radio channel selection","cognitive radio system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4607896","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2008.4607896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","abstract":"This presents our design and development of an 8-channel adaptive beamforming antenna for new developments in radio technology: the emergence of chip-based components implementing the recently completed IEEE 802.16d-2004 (WiMAX) radio standard [1-4].

Although the new WiMAX standard offers the potential for using smart, adaptive antennas, this functionality has not been implemented. Our design will serve as a common platform for testing adaptive array algorithms including direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, beamforming, and adaptive tracking, as well as complete wireless communication with a WiMAX radio. Heavy emphasis will be placed on ease of implementation in a multi-channel/multi-user environment.

We propose two major steps to make a particle filter to work in a distributed way. The first step is the estimation of global mean and covariance of weighted particles by using an average consensus filter. The second step is the propagation of the estimated global mean and covariance through state transition distribution and likelihood distribution by using an unscented transformation. Through this transformation, partial high order information of the estimated global mean and covariance can be incorporated into the estimates for non-linear models. Simulations of tracking tasks in a sensor network with 100 sensor nodes are given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608015/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10179117","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608015/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Consensus based distributed particle filter in sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus based distributed particle filter in sensor networks","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA08-059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065556S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599584","isNumber":"4607950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599584","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4607950","articleId":"4608015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4608048,"authors":[{"name":"Shujuan Peng","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Shujuan Peng","id":"37693769700"},{"name":"Debao Ma","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Debao Ma","id":"37693068400"},{"name":"Jianlin Lin","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jianlin Lin","id":"37694658100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2183-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2184-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4608048","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Azimuth","Parameter estimation","Apertures","Fourier transforms","Synthetic aperture radar","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","object detection","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional Fourier transform","spaceborne SAR","synthetic aperture radar","ground moving target detection","moving target echo signal","Doppler parameter estimation","linear frequency modulation","imaging quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT)","moving target detection","Doppler parameter estimation"]}],"abstract":"Doppler parameter estimation of Azimuth echo is the key for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ground moving target detection. This paper will apply Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) to moving target echo signals for Doppler parameter estimation in Spaceborne SAR. Itpsilas well known that within a synthetic aperture time, the relative motion between moving targets and SAR makes the slant range vary with time so that Doppler parameters will change accordingly. Compute the mean values of the gained Doppler centroid and frequency modulation rate along azimuth direction for each target, and this ensures that echoes of a moving target may be approximated by a linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal in theory. Simulation results prove that the parameter mean values can make imaging quality of moving targets better and achieve accurate real time processing within a synthetic aperture time.","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608048","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599584/4607950/04608048.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607950","startPage":"485","endPage":"488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Fourier Transform for moving target detection and location in spaceborne SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Fourier Transform for moving target detection and location in spaceborne SAR","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608048/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10179043","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4608048/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Fourier Transform for moving target detection and location in spaceborne SAR","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA08-092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08782S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599584","isNumber":"4607950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599584","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4607950","articleId":"4608048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4608059,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Hongguo","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China","National Key Laboratory of Integrated Information System Technology, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhu Hongguo","id":"37699156400"},{"name":"Zheng Changwen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Information System Technology, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Changwen","id":"37688597800"},{"name":"Hu Xiaohui","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Information System Technology, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hu Xiaohui","id":"37686623600"},{"name":"Li Xiang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Li Xiang","id":"37300003300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2183-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2184-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4608059","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Optimization","Vehicles","Planning","Algorithm design and analysis","Encoding","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","particle swarm optimisation","path planning","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planner","unmanned aerial vehicles","space representation","particle swarm optimization","path planning problem"]}],"abstract":"Most path planning algorithms existed have disadvantages in space representation, constraints handling or computation efficiency.

It consists of a central server and a number of remote units, and each unit has four video channels. The remote unit encodes and stores the video images locally, and then transmits the encoded video stream to the central server via CDMA networks. To make the system efficiently work, we used modified H.263 algorithms and designed a video transmission protocol. We use the last good frame as reference image to avoid slowing down the frame rate. The experiments show that the maximum bit-rate could reach 70 Kbits/s. We have achieved a maximum frame rate at 6 frames/s with PSNR above 30 DBS. Since the system will be running in a wireless environment, fault tolerance, error correction and system stability are major concerns in software design and implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608179","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599584/4607950/04608179.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of video surveillance system based on CDMA cellular wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608179/","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of video surveillance system based on CDMA cellular wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10179303","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608179/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of video surveillance system based on CDMA cellular wireless networks","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA08-223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036265S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599584","isNumber":"4607950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599584","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4607950","articleId":"4608179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4608196,"authors":[{"name":"Yunong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yunong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279965700"},{"name":"Zhiguo Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Tan","id":"37655066200"},{"name":"Zhi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37656520600"},{"name":"Xuanjiao Lv","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Xuanjiao","lastName":"Lv","id":"37703567100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2183-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2184-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4608196","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608196","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Manipulators","Robots","Artificial neural networks","Redundancy","Trajectory","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","quadratic programming","recurrent neural nets","redundant manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual neural network","five-link planar robot arm","recurrent neural network","online joint angle drift-free redundancy-resolution","five-link planar robot manipulator","joint limits","joint velocity limits","quadratic-programming","real-time solver"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608196","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599584/4607950/04608196.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information and Automation","startPage":"1274","endPage":"1279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4607950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual neural network applied to drift-free resolution of five-link planar robot arm","abstract":"In this paper, a recurrent neural network (termed, dual neural network) is revisited and applied to the online joint angle drift-free redundancy-resolution of a five-link planar robot manipulator. To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited in the form of a quadratic function. In addition, the drift-free scheme could incorporate multiple joint physical limits such as joint limits and joint velocity limits simultaneously. Such a scheme is finally reformulated as a quadratic-programming (QP) problem. Similar to other new types of recurrent neural networks, the dual neural network is piecewise-linear as well and has a simple architecture of only one layer of neurons. As a QP real-time solver, the dual neural network could globally exponentially converge to the optimal solution of a strictly-convex quadratic program. This suits well our scheme formulation on drift-free redundancy-resolution of robots. The dual neural network is then simulated based on the five-link planar robot manipulator, which substantiates the effectiveness of the joint-angle-drift-free neural resolution scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608196/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10179206","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608196/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A dual neural network applied to drift-free resolution of five-link planar robot arm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual neural network applied to drift-free resolution of five-link planar robot arm","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA08-240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084535S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599584","isNumber":"4607950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599584","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4607950","articleId":"4608196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4608234,"authors":[{"name":"Tianzhong Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Tianzhong Zhao","id":"37087162879"},{"name":"Jianjiang Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jianjiang Lu","id":"37087331063"},{"name":"Yafei Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yafei Zhang","id":"37087155795"},{"name":"Qi Xiao","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Qi Xiao","id":"37088046981"},{"name":"Weiguang Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Weiguang Xu","id":"37088046703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2183-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2184-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4608234","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Gallium","Transform coding","Visualization","Image color analysis","Biological cells","Boosting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","genetic algorithms","image classification","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classifier ensemble","genetic algorithm","automatic image annotation","image classification","AdaBoost algorithm","image low-level features","multimedia content description interface","search space","multiclass weak classifier","k-nearest neighbor classifier","Corel images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic image annotation","Classifier ensemble","Genetic algorithm","Multimedia content description interface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608234","abstract":"Image classification approach is one promising method used for automatic image annotation. In order to improve image annotation accuracy, recent researchers propose to use AdaBoost algorithm for the ensemble of classifiers.

As a result, it is easy to fall into local optimal. We use all the 25 image low-level features of Multimedia Content Description Interface to descript images. Genetic algorithm is used to decrease the search space by randomly select a subset of features. We construct a multi-class weak classifier for each of the features in the subset and their potential combinations respectively. k-nearest neighbor classifier is used as the base classifier and dasiaone vs. onepsila scheme is chosen to build multi-class classifiers. Lastly, we use AdaBoost. M1 algorithm to generate an ensemble classifier and optimize it combining with genetic algorithm.

The SFLA is a meta-heuristic search method inspired from the memetic evolution of a group of frogs when seeking for food. It consists of a frog leaping rule for local search and a memetic shuffling rule for global information exchange. In this paper, a new frog leaping rule is proposed to improve the local exploration of the SFLA. The main idea behind the new frog leaping rule is to extend the direction and the length of each frogpsilas jump by emulating frogpsilas perception and action uncertainties. The modification widens the local search space, thus helps to prevent premature convergence and improves the performance of the SFLA. The modified SFLA is then used to tune multivariable PID controllers such that a specified performance criterion is minimized. The effectiveness of the proposed SFLA-based PID tuning method is illustrated via an application to the Wood-Berry distillation column. Simulation results show that the proposed SFLA is able to find better PID controllers than other methods such as the biggest log-modulus tuning (BLT) method and the multi-crossover genetic algorithm (GA).","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2008.4608439","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599586/4608308/04608439.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2008.4608439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm for optimal tuning of multivariable PID controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608439/","displayDocTitle":"A modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm for optimal tuning of multivariable PID controllers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10179553","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608439/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm for optimal tuning of multivariable PID controllers","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"MP2-E1_013838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055595S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599586","isNumber":"4608308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599586","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4608308","articleId":"4608439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4608480,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiong Liu","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599914200"},{"name":"Yan Wu","affiliation":["School of Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37088841211"},{"name":"Jingping Shi","affiliation":["College of Automation Northwestern, Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jingping","lastName":"Shi","id":"37672032100"},{"name":"Weiguo Zhang","affiliation":["College of Automation Northwestern, Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weiguo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37597062100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1705-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1706-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4608480","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608480","abstract":"Considered influence of nonlinear system and disturbance, a new adaptive fault-tolerant control method based on neural network model-following adaptive inversion control is introduced for flight control system in the presence of control surface damage.

presented in this paper, which is used to solve the joint angle drift problem of PUMA560 robot arm. To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited in the form of a quadratic function. In addition, the physical constraints such as joint limits and joint velocity limits are incorporated into the problem formulation of such a scheme. The scheme is finally reformulated as a strictly-convex quadratic-programming (QP) problem and resolved at joint-velocity level. As a QP real-time solver, the simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network is developed based on the QP-LVI conversion and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. It has a simple piecewise-linear dynamics and global exponential convergence to the optimal solution of strictly-convex quadratic-program. The simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network is simulated based on PUMA560 robot manipulator, and effectively remedies the joint angle drift problem of PUMA560 robot.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608481/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10179449","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608481/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint angle drift problem of PUMA560 robot arm solved by a simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint angle drift problem of PUMA560 robot arm solved by a simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu","sourcePdf":"TA1-G3_000973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091651S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599586","isNumber":"4608308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599586","xplore-issue":"4608308","articleId":"4608481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4608487,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Power Electronics Research Center, College of Electric and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Wei Chen","id":"37087265841"},{"name":"Yunping Zou","affiliation":["Power Electronics Research Center, College of Electric and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Yunping Zou","id":"37087346235"},{"name":"Lijuan Xu","affiliation":["High Power Electronics Laboratory, China Electrical Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lijuan Xu","id":"37087394500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1705-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1706-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4608487","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":493},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608487","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Rectifiers","Reactive power","Pulse width modulation","Power control","Control systems","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","PWM rectifiers","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct power control","neutral-point-clamped three-level PWM rectifier","voltage vector","instantaneous power control technique","instantaneous active power","instantaneous reactive power","converter switching state"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct Power Control","NPC PWM rectifier","Neutral-point potential balance"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a direct power control (DPC) strategy employed for the neutral-point-clamped (NPC) three-level PWM rectifier.

The bit-stream technique is inherently parallel in nature and hence performance is not affected by the size of the network. It is well suited for field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) but could easily be implemented on digital application specific integrated circuits (ASIC).

The steady-state operation of maintaining voltage stability is done by switching various controllers scattered all over the network. Some of the common controllers are the PV or generation buses voltage magnitudes, static reactive power (VAR) compensators, and under load tap transformers. When a contingency occurs, whether forced or unforced, the dispatcher in the energy control center is to alleviate the problem in a minimum time, cost, and effort. Persistent problem may lead to blackout. The dispatcher is to have the appropriate switching of controllers in terms of type, location, and size to remove the contingency and maintain voltage stability. Wrong switching may worsen the problem and that may lead to blackout. Thus, to do this intricate and delicate switching is a challenging task and requires highly experienced dispatcher. This work proposed and used an artificial neural network (ANN) to assist the dispatcher in the decision making.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2008.4608581","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599586/4608308/04608581.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2008.4608581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks and static voltage stability in power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Power system stability","Power systems","Voltage control","Neurons","Reactive power","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","fault diagnosis","power system analysis computing","power system stability","power transformers","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static voltage stability","power systems","generation buses voltage magnitudes","static reactive power Var compensators","under load tap transformers","energy control center","artificial neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and static voltage stability in power systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608581/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2008","accessionNumber":"10179491","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and static voltage stability in power systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"TP2-E6_007498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069977S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599586","isNumber":"4608308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599586","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4608308","articleId":"4608581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4608583,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The traditional rectifier connected to supply network with an L filter. Increasing the L value can attenuate the ripple current around switch frequency which fulfills standards but it will decrease the response speed and stability of the system. An LCL filter is more effective and reduce harmonic distortion at lower switch frequency than an L filter. However an LCL filter will bring stability problem. One solution is to use a damping resistor which is in series or parallel with the filter capacitor and this is called \"passive damping\". This method will increase the losses and decrease the efficiency of the system. Other solution is to modify control algorithm to stabilize the system which is called \"active damping (AD)\". This method avoid lose problem through adding complexity of control strategy. This paper analyze damping principle of each method include passive damping and active damping, show the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. In this paper, the ripple current attenuation function of passive damping is given to analyze the filter effort for the first time.

The proposed method has been derived from example-based hallucination methods and morphable face models. First, we propose a recursive error back-projection method to compensate for residual errors, and a region-based reconstruction method to preserve characteristics of local facial regions. Then, we define an extended morphable face model, in which an extended face is composed of the interpolated high-resolution face from a given low-resolution face, and its original high-resolution equivalent. Then, the extended face is separated into an extended shape and an extended texture. We performed various hallucination experiments using the MPI, XM2VTS, and KF databases, compared the reconstruction errors, structural similarity index, and recognition rates, and showed the effects of face detection errors and shape estimation errors. The encouraging results demonstrate that the proposed methods can improve the performance of face recognition systems. Especially the proposed method can enhance the resolution of single-frame, low-resolution facial images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Example-Based Face Hallucination Method for Single-Frame, Low-Resolution Facial Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2001394","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4623174/04608717.pdf","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2001394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Example-Based Face Hallucination Method for Single-Frame, Low-Resolution Facial Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4608717/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185937","pubMedId":"18784029","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Example-Based Face Hallucination Method for Single-Frame, Low-Resolution Facial Images","sourcePdf":"17tip09-jpark-2001394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091279S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4623174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4623174","articleId":"4608717","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4608730,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4608730/4608730-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Liang (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

If intracluster node-to-node multihop needs be taken into account, the maximum spanning tree searching (MASTS) algorithm, with respect to the cross-layer design, always provides a path connecting all sensors. When the WSN is organized in a manner of cluster-to-cluster multihop, the singular-value decomposition-QR with threshold (SVD-QR-T) approach selects the best subset of transmitters while keeping all receivers active. The threshold is adaptive by means of fuzzy c-means (FCM). These two approaches are compared by simulation against the case without channel selection in terms of capacity, bit error rate (BER), and multiplexing gain with water filling or equal transmission power allocation. Despite less multiplexing gain, when water filling is applied, MASTS achieves higher capacity and lower BER than virtual MIMO without channel selection at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), whereas SVD-QR-T by FCM provides the lowest BER at high SNR; in the case of no water filling and equal transmission power allocation, MASTS still offers the highest capacity at moderate-to-high SNR, but SVD-QR-T by FCM achieves the lowest BER. Both algorithms provide satisfying performances with reduced resource consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04608730.pdf","startPage":"2249","endPage":"2257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2004705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2004705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Selection in Virtual MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Bit error rate","Filling","Decision trees","Clustering algorithms","Cross layer design","Joining processes","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","error statistics","fuzzy set theory","MIMO communication","multiplexing","search problems","singular value decomposition","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual MIMO wireless sensor networks","channel selection","virtual multiple-input-multiple-output network","wireless sensor networks","intracluster node-to-node multihop","maximum spanning tree searching algorithm","cross-layer design","singular-value decomposition","threshold approach","transmitters","receivers","fuzzy C-means","bit error rate","multiplexing gain","equal transmission power allocation","moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratio","resource consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel selection","fuzzy c-means (FCM)","maximal spanning tree","singular-value decomposition-QR (SVD-QR)","virtual multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel Selection in Virtual MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4608730/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10630436","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Selection in Virtual MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-liang-2004705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.470488S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4608730","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4608734,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Nekuii","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Nekuii","id":"37685919400"},{"name":"Timothy N.

By assigning appropriate priorities to the level at which this ldquobest-first search per levelrdquo processing restarts once a leaf node has been obtained, the proposed demodulators can achieve tradeoffs between performance and complexity that dominate those of several existing methods, including the stack algorithm, in the low-complexity region.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04608734.pdf","startPage":"2592","endPage":"2597","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2004961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2004961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multistack Algorithm for Soft MIMO Demodulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Demodulation","Partitioning algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Transceivers","Iterative decoding","Tree data structures","Wireless communication","Computational efficiency","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","MIMO communication","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistack algorithm","soft MIMO demodulation","multiple-input-multiple-output communication system","tree structure traversal","best-first search step"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative demodulation and decoding (IDD)","list demodulation","sphere decoder","stack algorithm","tree-search decoding","turbo principle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Multistack Algorithm for Soft MIMO Demodulation","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4608734/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645549","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multistack Algorithm for Soft MIMO Demodulation","sourcePdf":"tvt-davidson-2004961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058505S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4608734","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4608738,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Basu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4771829/4608738/4608738-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaushik Basu received the B.Eng. degree from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpore, India, in 2003, and the M.Sc.

None of them is simultaneously simple, fast, and nonredundant. Real discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) is simple, fast, and nonredundant, but it is usually regarded to be lacking PI. After finding out that RDWT conserves the PI of an analyzed signal, this paper proposed three RDWT-based PI extraction methods and proved that RDWT-based PI extraction methods are equal to CoWT-based ones from the mathematical point of view. Therefore, RDWT-based methods not only can extract PI but also can inherit all merits of RDWT. This paper further presented a quadrature procedure to extract the actual phase of single-frequency or asymptotic signals. Test examples demonstrated that the extracted PI by using the CoWT- and RDWT-based methods is almost the same, and the extracted phase curves by using the RDWT-based quadrature method are really the actual ones. Some engineering applications of the proposed method are discussed, and the PI extraction programs of the method are given.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4796879/04608741.pdf","startPage":"891","endPage":"899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2004389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2004389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real Wavelet Transform-Based Phase Information Extraction Method: Theory and Demonstrations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Discrete wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Wavelet domain","Signal analysis","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","Power system analysis computing","Power system faults","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","integration","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex wavelet transform","phase information extraction","real discrete wavelet transform","quadrature procedure","single-frequency signal","asymptotic signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex continuous wavelet transform (CCWT)","complex discrete wavelet transform (CDWT)","phase information (PI) extraction method","quadrature signal in wavelet domain","real discrete wavelet transform (RDWT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Real Wavelet Transform-Based Phase Information Extraction Method: Theory and Demonstrations","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4608741/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10479731","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real Wavelet Transform-Based Phase Information Extraction Method: Theory and Demonstrations","sourcePdf":"tie-xiangxun-2004389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109996S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4796879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4796879","articleId":"4608741","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4608742,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The approach is based on the identification of characteristic patterns introduced by fault components in the wavelet signals obtained from the DWT of transient stator currents. These patterns enable a reliable detection of the corresponding fault as well as a clear interpretation of the physical phenomenon taking place in the machine. The proposed approach is applied to the detection of rotor asymmetries in two alternative ways, i.e., by using the startup current and by using the current during plugging stopping. Mixed eccentricities are also detected by means of the transient-based methodology. This paper shows how the evolution of other non-fault-related components such as the principal slot harmonic (PSH) can be extracted with the proposed technique. A compilation of experimental cases regarding the application of the methodology to the previous cases is presented. Guidelines for the easy application of the methodology by any user are also provided under a didactic perspective.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

of overhead cranes subject to both system uncertainty and actuator nonlinearity. First, a fuzzy sliding-mode control (FSMC) law is designed for the antisway trajectory tracking of the nominal plant. In association with a conventional trajectory tracking control law, this FSMC law guarantees asymptotic stability as well as improved transient response of the load sway dynamics while the trolley tracking error dynamics is rendered uniformly asymptotically stable. Second, a fuzzy uncertainty observer is designed to cope with system uncertainty as well as actuator nonlinearity present in an actual plant, and it is incorporated with the FSMC law for the development of the AFSMC law. In addition to stability analysis, the robust performance of the proposed AFSMC law is verified via numerical simulations and experiments. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608748/","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10291062","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Antisway Tracking Control of Overhead Cranes With System Uncertainty and Actuator Nonlinearity Using an Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antisway Tracking Control of Overhead Cranes With System Uncertainty and Actuator Nonlinearity Using an Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control","sourcePdf":"tie-chwa-2004385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046041S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"4663160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"114","articleId":"4608748","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4608749,"authors":[{"name":"Rosa A.

In addition to the total power constraint on all the relays, we introduce individual power constraint for each relay, which reflects the practical scenario where all relays are separated from one another. Considering the individual power constraint for the relay networks is the major difference from that in the traditional point-to-point communication systems where only a total power constraint exists for all colocated antennas. Two types of channel estimation are involved: maximum likelihood (ML) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). For ML channel estimation, the channels are assumed as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">deterministic</i>\n and the optimal training results from an efficient multilevel waterfilling type solution that is derived from the majorization theory. For MMSE channel estimation, however, the second-order statistics of the channels are assumed known and the general optimization problem turns out to be nonconvex. We instead consider three special yet reasonable scenarios. The problem in the first scenario is convex and could be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art optimization tools. Closed-form waterfilling type solutions are found in the remaining two scenarios, of which the first one has an interesting physical interpretation as pouring water into caves.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Training Design for Channel Estimation in Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks With Individual and Total Power Constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005084","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04608751.pdf","startPage":"5937","endPage":"5949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Training Design for Channel Estimation in Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks With Individual and Total Power Constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4608751/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313310","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Training Design for Channel Estimation in Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks With Individual and Total Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-nallanathan-2005084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121516S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4608751","onlineDate":"26 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4608867,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuro Kikuchi","affiliation":["Department of Frontier Informatics, University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4608852/4608867/4608867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazuro Kikuchi (M'90) was born in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, on March 6, 1952.

The entire payload path in the optical domain exhibits a capacity of nearly 1 Tb/s. Further experimental measurements investigate the OPS interconnection network's flexibility and robustness in terms of optical power dynamic range and network timing. Subsequent experimental investigations support the physical layer scalability of the implemented architecture and serve to substantiate the merits of the data vortex OPS network architectural paradigm.

The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.923738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4608920/04608934.pdf","startPage":"1203","endPage":"1218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.923738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Complementary Filters on the Special Orthogonal Group","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Complementary Filters on the Special Orthogonal Group","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608934/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10160460","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608934/","volume":"53","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Complementary Filters on the Special Orthogonal Group","sourcePdf":"53tac05-mahony.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139016S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4608920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"982","xplore-issue":"4608920","articleId":"4608934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":4608943,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Schenato","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Schenato","id":"37265689800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4608943","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":350,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2704},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","Networked control systems","Computer architecture","Linear systems","Sensor systems","Digital communication","Loss measurement","State estimation","Stochastic processes","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","control system synthesis","delays","linear systems","optimal control","probability","protocols","sampled data systems","sensors","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal estimation design","networked control systems","random delay","packet drop","sampled linear systems","sensor measurements","digital communication network","minimum error covariance estimator","time-varying stochastic system","communication protocol","finite memory buffer","packet loss probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kalman filter","minimum variance estimator","networked control systems","packet drop","random time delay"]}],"abstract":"In this note, we study optimal estimation design for sampled linear systems where the sensors measurements are transmitted to the estimator site via a generic digital communication network. Sensor measurements are subject to random delay or might even be completely lost. We show that the minimum error covariance estimator is time-varying, stochastic, and it does not converge to a steady state. Moreover, the architecture of this estimator is independent of the communication protocol and can be implemented using a finite memory buffer if the delivered packets have a finite maximum delay. We also present two alternative estimator architectures that are more computationally efficient and provide upper and lower bounds for the performance of the time-varying estimator. The stability of these estimators does not depend on packet delay but only on the overall packet loss probability. Finally, algorithms to compute critical packet loss probability and estimators performance in terms of their error covariance are given and applied to some numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.921012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4608920/04608943.pdf","startPage":"1311","endPage":"1317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.921012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Estimation in Networked Control Systems Subject to Random Delay and Packet Drop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608943/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Estimation in Networked Control Systems Subject to Random Delay and Packet Drop","volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10160466","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608943/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Estimation in Networked Control Systems Subject to Random Delay and Packet Drop","sourcePdf":"53tac05-schenato-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070742S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4608920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"350","xplore-issue":"4608920","articleId":"4608943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4608946,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Tabbara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Tabbara","id":"37840356500"},{"name":"Dragan Nesic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Nesic","id":"38188157600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4608946","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":143,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":926},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Networked control systems","Stochastic systems","Access protocols","Stochastic processes","Control systems","Multiaccess communication","Wireless application protocol","Ethernet networks","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","local area networks","Lyapunov methods","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input-output stability","networked control systems","stochastic protocols","channels","stochastic analog","carrier-sense multiple access style protocols","Ethernet","802.11a/b/g","random packet transmission","deterministic protocols","try-once-discard","random packet dropouts","Lyapunov-theoretic stability","network protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked control systems (NCS)","protocols","stochastic systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new definition of stochastic protocols for networked control systems (NCS) and the stochastic analog of the notion of uniform persistency of excitation of protocols first presented in the Proceedings of the 44th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control.

Unlike previous work, we allow for multiple fading blocks within each transmission (ARQ round), and we constrain the transmitter to fixed rate codes constructed over complex signal constellations. In particular, we examine the general case of average input-power-constrained con stellations with a fixed signaling alphabet of finite cardinality. This scenario is a suitable model for practical wireless communications systems employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques over a MIMO ARQ channel. Two cases of fading dynamics are considered, namely, short-term static fading where channel fading gains change randomly for each ARQ round, and long-term static fading where channel fading gains remain constant over all ARQ rounds pertaining to a given message. As our main result, we prove that for the block-fading MIMO ARQ channel with a fixed signaling alphabet satisfying a short-term power constraint, the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exponent is given by a modified Singleton bound, relating all the system parameters. To demonstrate the practical significance of the theoretical analysis, we present numerical results showing that practical Singleton-bound-achieving maximum distance separable codes achieve the optimal SNR exponent.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4608952/04608960.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608952","startPage":"3968","endPage":"3986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Throughput-Diversity-Delay Tradeoff in MIMO ARQ Block-Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Throughput-Diversity-Delay Tradeoff in MIMO ARQ Block-Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180423","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4608960/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Throughput-Diversity-Delay Tradeoff in MIMO ARQ Block-Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit09-chuang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112577S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4608952","articleId":"4608960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4608965,"authors":[{"name":"Pranav Dayal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, Boulder, CO, USA","QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pranav","lastName":"Dayal","id":"37270463000"},{"name":"Mahesh K.

The distributed coding schemes are designed for a system that consists of m users that need to send their information to a common destination. Each user is equipped with only one antenna and a half-duplex transceiver so that it can transmit to the destination or any other user at one time and also receive signals from any other user at another time. The destination is equipped with one or more receive antennas. The goal is to design cooperative schemes which achieve the maximum diversity order (which is equal to the diversity order of the outage probability) while being fair to the users in terms of rate allocation. Two cooperative coding schemes are proposed that meet these requirements-a two-phase cooperative scheme and a single-phase self-information canceling linear (SCL) scheme. The two-phase scheme is of lower decoding complexity and it requires the users to only transmit QAM symbols. The SCL scheme is of higher complexity with the users transmitting linear combination of QAM symbols but it also achieves better performance. Both schemes incorporate new classes of cooperation rules for deciding whether or not a user acts as a relay for another user. The usual \"outage-based\" cooperation rule, whereby a user cooperates with another user provided the mutual information of the channel between them is greater than the rate, is sufficient for deriving information-theoretic limits but it cannot be used directly for analysis of a particular coding scheme. Even though the decoder used by the destination in the proposed coding schemes assumes that the inter-user communication is always successful, our performance analysis does not make this assumption. In fact, it rigorously accounts for the decoding errors arising from the information exchange between users. Consequently, it sheds light on precisely what cooperation rules (among the class of rules analyzed) lead to maximal diversity.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4608952/04608965.pdf","startPage":"4342","endPage":"4354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed QAM-Based Space-Time Block Codes for Efficient Cooperative Multiple-Access Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608965/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed QAM-Based Space-Time Block Codes for Efficient Cooperative Multiple-Access Communication","volume":"54","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180428","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed QAM-Based Space-Time Block Codes for Efficient Cooperative Multiple-Access Communication","sourcePdf":"54tit09-dayal-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047612S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4608965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4608968,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuele Grossi","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Grossi","id":"37283963500"},{"name":"Marco Lops","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lops","id":"37268086700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4608968","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608968","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Hidden Markov models","State estimation","Signal generators","Noise generators","System testing","Sequential analysis","Parameter estimation","Sufficient conditions","Radar applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov targets","targets sequential detection","trajectory estimation","signal detection","signal estimation","hidden Markov model","maximum a posteriori probability","radar surveillance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic optimality","hidden Markov models (HMM)","sequential detection and estimation","sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4608952/04608968.pdf","startPage":"4144","endPage":"4154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Detection of Markov Targets With Trajectory Estimation","abstract":"The problem of detection and possible estimation of a signal generated by a dynamic system when a variable number of noisy measurements can be taken is here considered.

Optimal multiplicity assignment strategies for algebraic soft-decision decoding (SDD) with infinite cost are first studied over erasure channels and the binary-symmetric channel. The corresponding decoding radii are calculated in closed forms and tight bounds on the error probability are derived. The multiplicity assignment strategy and the corresponding performance analysis are then generalized to characterize the decoding region of algebraic SDD over a mixed error and bit-level erasure channel. The bit-level decoding region of the proposed multiplicity assignment strategy is shown to be significantly larger than that of conventional Berlekamp-Massey decoding. As an application, a bit-level generalized minimum distance decoding algorithm is proposed. The proposed decoding compares favorably with many other Reed-Solomon SDD algorithms over various channels. Moreover, owing to the simplicity of the proposed bit-level generalized minimum distance decoding, its performance can be tightly bounded using order statistics.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4608952/04608976.pdf","startPage":"3907","endPage":"3928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Soft-Decision Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon Codes Using Bit-Level Soft Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Soft-Decision Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon Codes Using Bit-Level Soft Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608976/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10180439","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608976/","volume":"54","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Soft-Decision Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon Codes Using Bit-Level Soft Information","sourcePdf":"54tit09-jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110736S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4608952","articleId":"4608976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4608977,"authors":[{"name":"Lifeng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37402804900"},{"name":"Hesham El Gamal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA","Director for theWireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"El Gamal","id":"37265026500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4608977","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":554,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3300},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Noise measurement","AWGN","Degradation","Wireless communication","Deafness","Performance gain","Protective relaying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","channel coding","telecommunication security","telecommunication terminals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication security","four-terminal relay-eavesdropper channel","cooperation strategies","rate-equivocation region","noise-forwarding strategy","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperation","eavesdropper","noise-forwarding (NF)","relay","security"]}],"abstract":"This paper establishes the utility of user cooperation in facilitating secure wireless communications. In particular, the four-terminal relay-eavesdropper channel is introduced and an outer-bound on the optimal rate-equivocation region is derived. Several cooperation strategies are then devised and the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation region are characterized. Of particular interest is the novel noise-forwarding (NF) strategy, where the relay node sends codewords independent of the source message to confuse the eavesdropper. This strategy is used to illustrate the deaf helper phenomenon, where the relay is able to facilitate secure communications while being totally ignorant of the transmitted messages. Furthermore, NF is shown to increase the secrecy capacity in the reversely degraded scenario, where the relay node fails to offer performance gains in the classical setting. The gain offered by the proposed cooperation strategies is then proved theoretically and validated numerically in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4608952/04608977.pdf","startPage":"4005","endPage":"4019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Relay\u2013Eavesdropper Channel: Cooperation for Secrecy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"The Relay\u2013Eavesdropper Channel: Cooperation for Secrecy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608977/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10180433","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4608977/","volume":"54","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Relay\u2013Eavesdropper Channel: Cooperation for Secrecy","sourcePdf":"54tit09-lai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135258S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"554","xplore-issue":"4608952","articleId":"4608977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4608982,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37278122800"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4608982","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Interference channels","Transmitters","Broadcasting","Integrated circuit modeling","Wireless communication","Quality management","Communication system control","Additives","Multiple access interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete degraded interference channel","DDIC capacity region","Benzel","broadcast channel","wireless communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity region","degradedness","interference channel"]}],"abstract":"We provide a single-letter characterization for the capacity region of a class of discrete degraded interference channels (DDICs).

Our framework comprises an additive white forward channel and a feedback link. We consider two types of corruption mechanisms in the feedback link. The first is quantization noise, i.e., the encoder receives the quantized values of the past outputs of the forward channel. The quantization is uniform, memoryless and time invariant. The second corruption mechanism is an arbitrarily distributed additive bounded noise. Here we allow symbol-by-symbol encoding at the input to the feedback link. We propose explicit schemes featuring positive information rate and positive error exponent. If the forward channel is additive white Gaussian (AWGN) then, as the amplitude of the noise at the feedback link decreases to zero, the rate of our schemes converges to the capacity of the channel. Moreover, the probability of error is shown to converge to zero at a doubly exponential rate. If the forward channel is AWGN and the feedback link consists of an additive bounded noise channel, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constrained symbol-by-symbol encoding, then our schemes achieve rates arbitrarily close to capacity, in the limit of high SNR (at the feedback link).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10180446","volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4608983/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coding for Additive White Noise Channels With Feedback Corrupted by Quantization or Bounded Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for Additive White Noise Channels With Feedback Corrupted by Quantization or Bounded Noise","sourcePdf":"54tit09-martins.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083531S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4608952","articleId":"4608983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4608989,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Pezeshki","affiliation":["Applied and Computational Mathematics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Pezeshki","id":"38576068300"},{"name":"A.

Unfortunately, it is often difficult, or impossible, to obtain data that directly reveal network structure, and so one must infer a network from incomplete data. This paper considers inferring network structure from \"co-occurrence\" data: observations that identify which network components (e.g., switches, routers, genes) carry each transmission but do not indicate the order in which they handle the transmission. Without order information, the number of networks that are consistent with the data grows exponentially with the size of the network (i.e., the number of nodes). Yet, the basic engineering/evolutionary principles underlying most networks strongly suggest that not all data-consistent networks are equally likely. In particular, nodes that co-occur in many observations are probably closely connected. With this in mind, we model the co-occurrence observations as independent realizations of a random walk on the network, subjected to a random permutation to account for the lack of order information. Treating permutations as missing data, we derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the random walk parameters. The model and EM algorithm significantly simplify the problem, but the computational complexity of the reconstruction process does grow exponentially in the length of each transmission path. For networks with long paths, the exact e-step may be computationally intractable. We propose a polynomial-time Monte Carlo EM algorithm based on importance sampling and derive conditions that ensure convergence of the algorithm with high probability. Simulations and experiments with Internet measurements demonstrate the promise of this approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10180451","htmlLink":"/document/4608990/","displayDocTitle":"Network Inference From Co-Occurrences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Inference From Co-Occurrences","sourcePdf":"54tit09-rabbat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135717S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4608952","articleId":"4608990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4608992,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Silva","affiliation":["The Edward S.

A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes is investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed from rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover, it is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be reformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where partial information about the error is available. This partial information may be in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value) and deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking erasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the error correction capability of a code: if mu erasures and delta deviations occur, then errors of rank t can always be corrected provided that 2t les d - 1 + mu + delta, where d is the minimum rank distance of the code. For Gabidulin codes, an important family of maximum rank distance codes, an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that can properly exploit erasures and deviations.

In order to do so, the receiver's transport layer is responsible for temporarily buffering out-of-order packets and resequencing them as more packets arrive. In this paper, we analyze a model where the disordering is caused by multipath routing. Packets are generated according to a Poisson process. Then, they arrive at a disordering network (DN) modeled by two parallel M/M/l queues, and are routed to each of the queues according to an independent Bernoulli process. A resequencing buffer follows the DN. In such a model, the packet resequencing delay is known. However, the size of the resequencing queue (RSQ) is unknown. We derive the probability for the large deviations of the queue size.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4608952/04608999.pdf","startPage":"4107","endPage":"4118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4608999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Large Deviations of Resequencing Queue Size: 2-M/M/1 Case","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Out of order","Routing","Transport protocols","Telecommunication network reliability","Communication system control","Propagation delay","Data communication","Load management","Performance loss","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","queueing theory","stochastic processes","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resequencing queue size","data communication networks","multipath routing","transmission control protocol","TCP","Poisson process","disordering network","M-M-1 queues","Bernoulli process","packet resequencing delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large deviations","resequencing queue (RSQ)","transport protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4608999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Large Deviations of Resequencing Queue Size: 2-M/M/1 Case","volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4608999/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180456","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Large Deviations of Resequencing Queue Size: 2-M/M/1 Case","sourcePdf":"54tit09-xia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101835S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4608952","articleId":"4608999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4609000,"authors":[{"name":"Bike Xie","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bike","lastName":"Xie","id":"37286484700"},{"name":"Miguel Griot","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Griot","id":"37298486500"},{"name":"Andres I.

Specifically, the system model consists of a wireless transmitter with controllable transmission rate, time-varying and stochastic channel state, and strict delay constraints on the packets in the queue. While the transmitter can control the rate, the transmission power required depends on the chosen rate and the prevailing channel condition. The objective is to obtain a rate control policy that serves the data within the deadline constraints while minimizing the total energy expenditure. Toward this end, we first introduce the canonical problem of transmitting B units of data by deadline T over a Markov fading channel, and obtain the optimal policy for it using continuous-time stochastic control theory. Using a novel cumulative curves methodology and a decomposition approach, we extend the above setup to consider extensions involving variable deadlines on the packets. Finally, utilizing the analysis we present a heuristic policy for the case of arbitrary packet arrivals to the queue with individual deadline constraints, and give illustrative simulation results for its performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.928249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4608952/04609003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.928249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608952","startPage":"4020","endPage":"4039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Rate Control for Delay-Constrained Data Transmission Over a Wireless Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Rate Control for Delay-Constrained Data Transmission Over a Wireless Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180458","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4609003/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Rate Control for Delay-Constrained Data Transmission Over a Wireless Channel","sourcePdf":"54tit09-zafer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129096S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4608952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4608952","articleId":"4609003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4609004,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengchun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhengchun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291514400"},{"name":"Xiaohu Tang","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding and TransmissionInstitute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280010500"},{"name":"Guang Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37272938000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4609004","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":735},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"By interleaving one length-N perfect sequence or ideal sequence according to elaborate phases, a new method of construction of zero correlation zone (ZCZ) and low correlation zone (LCZ) sequence sets is presented.

In the DSNFN, a five-layer neural-fuzzy network (NFN) is used to model complex processes and compensate for structured and unstructured uncertainties. However, it is difficult to find a suitable-sized NFN to achieve the required approximation error. To deal with the mentioned problem, the number of rule nodes in the DSNFN can be either increased or decreased over time based on the tracking errors, and the adaptation laws in the sense of a projection algorithm are derived for tuning all parameters of the parameterized NFN. Using DSNFN, good tracking performance could be achieved in the system. Furthermore, the trained network avoids the problems of overfitting and underfitting. The global stability and the robustness of the overall control scheme are guaranteed, and the tracking errors converge to the required precision by the Lyapunov synthesis approach. Experiments performed on a two-link robot manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Structure Neural-Fuzzy Networks for Robust Adaptive Control of Robot Manipulators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.926778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4609005/04609007.pdf","startPage":"3402","endPage":"3414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.926778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609007/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Structure Neural-Fuzzy Networks for Robust Adaptive Control of Robot Manipulators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4609007/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180492","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Structure Neural-Fuzzy Networks for Robust Adaptive Control of Robot Manipulators","sourcePdf":"55tie09-chen2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09837S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4609005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4609005","articleId":"4609007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4609014,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In modeling the fluid dispensing process, it is important to understand the process behavior as well as determine the optimum operating conditions of the process for a high-yield, low-cost, and robust operation. Modeling the fluid dispensing process is a complex nonlinear problem. This kind of problem is suitable to be solved by applying a neural network. Among the different kinds of neural networks, the WNN is a good choice to solve the problem. In the proposed WNN, the translation parameters are variables depending on the network inputs. Due to the variable translation parameters, the network becomes an adaptive one that provides better performance and increased learning ability than conventional WNNs. An improved hybrid PSO is applied to train the parameters of the proposed WNN. The proposed hybrid PSO incorporates a wavelet-theory-based mutation operation. It applies the wavelet theory to enhance the PSO in more effectively exploring the solution space to reach a better solution. A case study of MFD-EP is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.922599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4609005/04609014.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.922599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"3447","endPage":"3460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimized Wavelet Neural Network for Modeling the Development of Fluid Dispensing for Electronic Packaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improved Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimized Wavelet Neural Network for Modeling the Development of Fluid Dispensing for Electronic Packaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609014/","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4609014/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180493","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimized Wavelet Neural Network for Modeling the Development of Fluid Dispensing for Electronic Packaging","sourcePdf":"55tie09-ling.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094397S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4609005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"4609005","articleId":"4609014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4609025,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Nazarathy","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4608852/4609025/4609025-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Moshe Nazarathy (SM'05) received the B.Sc. degree (cum laude) and the Dr. Sci.EE. degrees from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.","He is a tenured associate professor with the Electrical Engineering Department at the Technion.

Since Wi-Fi may be freely used by other networks, added interference may eventually invalidate the original frequency assignment, making full link activation impossible. In this paper, we address this problem by selectively installing supplementary free-space optical (FSO) links when radio-frequency (RF) link performance has deteriorated. To minimize cost, the number of FSO links that are needed should be as small as possible. We first formulate the channel assignment problem with the objective of maximizing the number of simultaneous link activations while satisfying cumulative RF interference constraints. A proof is given for the NP-completeness of the joint frequency assignment and FSO link placement problem. We then propose an efficient heuristic to solve the channel assignment problem using a genetic algorithm. Results are then presented for various mesh networks which show that the proposed algorithm has good results compared with the computed bounds. The presented results show that the use of FSO links permits WLAN mesh network deployment in interference-prone situations.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.909197","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4608852/04609027.pdf","startPage":"1735","endPage":"1743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.909197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Management in WLAN Mesh Networks Using Free-Space Optical Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2008","displayDocTitle":"Interference Management in WLAN Mesh Networks Using Free-Space Optical Links","volume":"26","issue":"13","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July1, 2008","accessionNumber":"10460294","htmlLink":"/document/4609027/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Management in WLAN Mesh Networks Using Free-Space Optical Links","sourcePdf":"26jlt13-rajakumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077623S","chronDate":"July1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4608852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4608852","articleId":"4609027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4609030,"authors":[{"name":"X.

By stretching the gratings, the two wavelengths of the proposed filter can be tuned whereas their channel spacing remains unchanged.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.913734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.913734","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1890","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4608852/04609030.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4608852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable Ultranarrow Dual-Channel Filter Based on Sampled FBGs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2008","displayDocTitle":"Tunable Ultranarrow Dual-Channel Filter Based on Sampled FBGs","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July1, 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","volume":"26","issue":"13","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4609030/","accessionNumber":"10470991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609030/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable Ultranarrow Dual-Channel Filter Based on Sampled FBGs","sourcePdf":"26jlt13-xliu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081996S","chronDate":"July1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4608852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4608852","articleId":"4609030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4609046,"authors":[{"name":"Henk D.

Thus OVA is different from existing data stream classification schemes whose majority use multiclass classifiers, each one to discriminate among all the classes. This paper advocates some outstanding advantages of OVA for data stream classification. First, there is low error correlation and hence high diversity among OVA's component classifiers, which leads to high classification accuracy. Second, OVA is adept at accommodating new class labels that often appear in data streams. However, there also remain many challenges to deploy traditional OVA for classifying data streams. First, as every instance is fed to all component classifiers, OVA is known as an inefficient model. Second, OVA's classification accuracy is adversely affected by the imbalanced class distribution in data streams. This paper addresses those key challenges and consequently proposes a new OVA scheme that is adapted for data stream classification. Theoretical analysis and empirical evidence reveal that the adapted OVA can offer faster training, faster updating and higher classification accuracy than many existing popular data stream classification algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2008.181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4804934/04609384.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804934","startPage":"624","endPage":"637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapted One-versus-All Decision Trees for Data Stream Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adapted One-versus-All Decision Trees for Data Stream Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10520351","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4609384/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapted One-versus-All Decision Trees for Data Stream Classification","sourcePdf":"ttk2009050624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052299S","chronDate":"May  2009","isNumber":"4804934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"55","articleId":"4609384","onlineDate":"29 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4609386,"authors":[{"name":"Sotirios P.

Nevertheless, Gaussian mixture models are well known to be highly intolerant to the presence of untypical data within the fitting data sets used for their estimation. Finite Student's t-mixture models have recently emerged as a heavier-tailed, robust alternative to Gaussian mixture models, overcoming these hurdles. To exploit these merits of Student's t-mixture models in the context of a sequential data modeling setting, we introduce, in this paper, a novel hidden Markov model where the hidden state distributions are considered to be finite mixtures of multivariate Student's t-densities. We derive an algorithm for the model parameters estimation under a maximum likelihood framework, assuming full, diagonal, and factor-analyzed covariance matrices.

For our second criterion, we consider the global system failure rate, seen as if the whole system were a single task scheduled onto a single processor, instead of the usual reliability, because it does not depend on the schedule length like the reliability does (due to its computation in the classical exponential distribution model). Therefore, we control better the replication factor of each individual task of the dependency task graph given as a specification, with respect to the desired failure rate. To solve this bicriteria optimization problem, we take the failure rate as a constraint, and we minimize the schedule length. We are thus able to produce, for a given dependency task graph and multiprocessor architecture, a Pareto curve of nondominated solutions, among which the user can choose the compromise that fits his or her requirements best. Compared to the other bicriteria (length and reliability) scheduling algorithms found in the literature, the algorithm we present here is the first able to improve significantly the reliability, by several orders of magnitude, making it suitable to safety-critical systems.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2008.50","startPage":"241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5325139/04609387.pdf","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2008.50","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609387/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Bicriteria Scheduling Heuristics Providing a Guaranteed Global System Failure Rate","volume":"6","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4609387/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10966042","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Bicriteria Scheduling Heuristics Providing a Guaranteed Global System Failure Rate","sourcePdf":"ttq2009040241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079007S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2009","isNumber":"5325139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"60","articleId":"4609387","onlineDate":"29 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4609390,"authors":[{"name":"Sudipta Dutta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4652575/4609390/4609390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sudipta Dutta was born in Durgapur, India, in 1983.

Therefore, investigation of techniques for congestion-free wheeling of power is of paramount interest. One of the most practiced and an obvious technique of congestion management is rescheduling the power outputs of generators in the system. However, all generators in the system need not take part in congestion management. Development of sound formulation and appropriate solution technique for this problem is aimed in this paper. Contributions made in the present paper are twofold. Firstly a technique for optimum selection of participating generators has been introduced using generator sensitivities to the power flow on congested lines. Secondly this paper proposes an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) which minimizes the deviations of rescheduled values of generator power outputs from scheduled levels. The PSO algorithm, reported in this paper, handles the binding constraints by a technique different from the traditional penalty function method. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been analyzed on IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems and the 39 -bus New England system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10311409","htmlLink":"/document/4609390/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Rescheduling of Generators for Congestion Management Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Rescheduling of Generators for Congestion Management Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs04-dutta-922647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095868S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4652575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"4652575","articleId":"4609390","onlineDate":"29 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4609407,"authors":[{"name":"Bas Boone","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - IBBT - IMEC, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bas","lastName":"Boone","id":"37686795900"},{"name":"Filip De Turck","affiliation":["Universiteit Gent, Gent, BE"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"De Turck","id":"37267851200"},{"name":"Bart Dhoedt","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - IBBT - IMEC, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Dhoedt","id":"37279070000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3302-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4609407","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":92},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609407","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Reliability","Delay","Software reliability","Software","Bandwidth","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","fault tolerant computing","integer programming","linear programming","object-oriented programming","software reliability","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed software component","fault tolerance","mixed integer linear programming","UML component diagram","UML activity diagram"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an MILP-based methodology is presented that allows to optimize the deployment of a set of software components over a set of computing resources, with respect to fault tolerance and response times.

A hybrid ant colony system (DSACA-VRPTW) is proposed to solve this problem. Firstly, each antpsilas solution might be improved by dynamic sweep Algorithm which makes improvement to the solutions by grouping the customers. Then a new improved ant colonies technique is proposed, after all colonies are in the state of stagnation, communication among them is carried out in order to do favor to leave the local peaks. Finally, Solomonpsilas benchmark instances (VRPTW 100-customer) are tested for the algorithm and shows that the DSACA is able to find solutions for VRPTW.","doi":"10.1109/CCCM.2008.85","publicationTitle":"2008 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609447/4609448/04609458.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCM.2008.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing with Time Windows","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609458/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing with Time Windows","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10186423","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4609458/","conferenceDate":"3-4 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing with Time Windows","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3290a008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055695S","chronDate":"3-4 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4609447","isNumber":"4609448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4609447","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4609448","articleId":"4609458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4609461,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Xia","affiliation":["School of Mathematics & Computer Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Xia","id":"37654552500"},{"name":"Xingwei Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics & Computer Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China","Key Laboratory of information Coding & Transmission Sichuan province, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406556300"},{"name":"Hui Zhao","affiliation":["School of Mathematics & Computer Engineering, Xihua University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37692911800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3290-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"4609461","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Media","Genetic algorithms","Streaming media","Peer to peer computing","Encoding","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","peer-to-peer computing","video on demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data assignment mechanism","genetic algorithm","P2PVoD system","NP-hard","global optimized algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCCM.2008.228","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609447/4609448/04609461.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","startPage":"23","endPage":"26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCM.2008.228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Data Assignment Mechanism Based on Genetic Algorithm in P2PVoD System","abstract":"The data assignment in P2PVoD is in essence a parallel processor issue.

This paper proposes to use probability neural network (PNN) to recognize the six kinds of control chart patterns (i.e. normal pattern, upward/downward mean shift pattern, upward/downward trend pattern, cyclic pattern) to improve the design effect of pattern recognition. Numerical simulation result shows that PNN has not only the feature of simpler topology structure but also the higher pattern recognition accuracy and faster recognition speed.

The combination of MIMO and OFDM improves significantly capacity of the system and overcome the frequency selective effects of broadband wireless channel.

Using these technologies along with rake receiver and error correction coding for interference limited DS-CDMA systems results in reducing interference while increasing capacity and coverage. In this paper, the performance of power controlled uplink under soft handover in DS-CDMA systems which uses error correction coding, has been evaluated.

It is shown that system under soft handover has less sensitivity against incrementing the power control error (PCE) and number of users.

On the one hand, cluster heads deliver the data to the base station with relay to reduce energy consumption. On the other hand, MRPUC uses many measures to balance the energy of nodes. First, it selects the nodes with more residual energy as cluster heads, and clusters closer to the base station have smaller sizes to preserve some energy during intra-cluster communication for inter-cluster packets forwarding. Second, when regular nodes join clusters, they consider not only the distance to cluster heads but also the residual energy of cluster heads. Third, cluster heads choose those nodes as relay nodes, which have minimum energy consumption for forwarding and maximum residual energy to avoid dying earlier. Simulation results show that MRPUC performs much better than similar protocols.","doi":"10.1109/CCCM.2008.99","startPage":"552","endPage":"556","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609447/4609622/04609747.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCM.2008.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop Routing Protocol with Unequal Clustering for Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Wireless sensor networks","Energy consumption","Head","Protocols","Sensors","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern clustering","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","multihop routing protocol with unequal clustering","base station","energy consumption","intracluster communication","intercluster packets forwarding","relay nodes","minimum energy consumption","maximum residual energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multihop Routing Protocol with Unequal Clustering for Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4609747/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","conferenceDate":"3-4 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10202847","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop Routing Protocol with Unequal Clustering for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3290b552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081086S","chronDate":"3-4 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4609447","isNumber":"4609622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4609447","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4609622","articleId":"4609747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":4609764,"authors":[{"name":"Licheng Liu","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Licheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37657001900"},{"name":"Xianhua Dai","affiliation":["School of Information and Science Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Xianhua","lastName":"Dai","id":"37279595100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3290-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"4609764","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Artificial neural networks","Indexes","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency response","White noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","frequency estimation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MC-DS-CDMA systems","pilot aided carrier frequency offset estimation","receiver","fast Fourier transform operation","high-resolution estimation","time-varying flat fading channel","low signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["carrier frequency offset","OFDM","MC-DS-CDMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation of the uplink of multicarrier DS-CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA) systems.

Here, we first develop the backward Greville formula to handle the case of row deletion. Based on the forward Greville formula, we then study the computation of para-pseudoinverse for extended filter banks and Laplacian pyramids. Through the backward Greville formula, we investigate the frame-based error resilient transmission over erasure channels. The necessary and sufficient condition for an oversampled filter bank to be robust to one erasure channel is derived. A postfiltering structure is also presented to implement the para-pseudoinverse when the transform coefficients in one subband are completely lost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Gallium nitride","Resilience","Least squares methods","Laplace equations","Acoustical engineering","Least squares approximation","Signal reconstruction","Signal synthesis","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive estimation","recursive filters","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["para-pseudoinverse","oversampled filter banks","Greville formulas","extended filter banks","Laplacian pyramids","frame-based error resilient transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual frame","frame expansions","Greville formulas","Laplacian pyramid","oversampled filter banks","para-pseudoinverse"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04609924.pdf","startPage":"5851","endPage":"5860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of the Para-Pseudoinverse for Oversampled Filter Banks: Forward and Backward Greville Formulas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computation of the Para-Pseudoinverse for Oversampled Filter Banks: Forward and Backward Greville Formulas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609924/","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4609924/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10313336","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of the Para-Pseudoinverse for Oversampled Filter Banks: Forward and Backward Greville Formulas","sourcePdf":"tsp-gan-2005086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073334S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4609924","onlineDate":"29 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4609925,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Guerriero","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4740190/4609925/4609925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Guerriero (S'06) was born in Salerno, Italy, on June 18, 1981.

It is shown first that for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cases, when the transmit SNR is lower than some value, say -20 dB, using optimal power spectrum allocation (OPSA) at the transmitter side can increase the reliable transmission rate considerably compared to the uniform power spectrum allocation scheme, while when the transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is higher than some value, say 10 dB, the benefit of OPSA is very limited. Therefore, measures such as the water-filling algorithm should be taken to make full use of the frequency-selectivity of UWB systems if the transmit SNR is low. Second, in the multiple-input single-output (MISO) case, the outage probability decreases with the number of transmit antennas when the communication rate is lower than some value, but increases instead when the rate is higher than another value.

Our goal is to optimize certain system utility functions (such as to minimize bit error rates or to maximize sum capacity) through the choice of the subcarrier assignment. We show that a large class of reasonable system utility functions that we wish to maximize are characterized as Schur-concave. For this class of utility functions, we obtain the optimum subcarrier assignment for single ARQ-SA and propose a suboptimum (heuristic) subcarrier assignment scheme for multiple ARQ-SA. Further, to lower the overhead of signaling the subcarrier assignment information, we consider subcarrier grouping methods. Numerical results indicate that substantial throughput improvement can be achieved by appropriate assignments, especially with the use of incremental redundancy at high signal-to-noise ratios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARQ by Subcarrier Assignment for OFDM-Based Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04609928.pdf","startPage":"6003","endPage":"6016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"ARQ by Subcarrier Assignment for OFDM-Based Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4609928/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313313","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARQ by Subcarrier Assignment for OFDM-Based Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-ho-2005093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144868S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4609928","onlineDate":"29 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4609935,"authors":[{"name":"Iker Mayordomo","affiliation":["CEIT and TECNUN, University of Navarra, San Sebastian, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4740169/4609935/4609935-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Iker Mayordomo was born in Bilbao, Spain, in 1979.

Two of the most popular planar transmission line configurations, namely microstrip and stripline, commonly used in printed circuit boards and radio frequency/microwave integrated circuits, are considered in this work. The trace separation between two adjacent transmission lines of each type is stepwise increased as function of the trace width. The single-ended transmission line structures are numerically investigated by a frequency-based 3-D full-wave electromagnetic analysis tool. A particular case using coated microstrip transmission lines has been fabricated, along with some calibration structures, to allow direct measurement and experimental analysis of crosstalk between the single-ended transmission lines. The test structures are characterized at high-frequency (up to 20 GHz) with scattering parameters using a vector network analyzer. The experimental results are compared with the simulation data, and some conclusions and suggestions on the impact and use of spacing rules for high-frequency crosstalk reduction between single-ended transmission lines are presented.

This model also has voltage stability analysis function and can reveal critical characteristics from reactive power and voltage viewpoint. Simulation results of the IEEE 118-bus system with this model show that the fast dynamics can capture the cascading process and the criticality property in micro scale. Besides, the macro scale of self-organized criticality of power systems can be revealed from the mean value of fractional overloads and the ratio of total load demand to the total network transfer capability.

Many nonlinear characteristics of power generators, and their operational constraints, such as generation limitations, ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zones, transmission loss, and nonlinear cost functions, were all considered for practical operation. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method were demonstrated by four system case studies and compared with previous literature in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

With the level of future demand for electricity being unclear, power market players are reluctant to commit to long-term capital investment, with the result that construction of new large-scale power plants and also transmission and distribution infrastructure is typically being avoided. At the same time, power facilities are being upgraded in response to business strategies for bringing a profit in power markets and for keeping supply reliability for customers. Under such circumstances of competitive power markets, practical use of renewable and distributed energy generation offers an attractive alternative for power supply. The advantages include a short construction cycle as the supply can be located near to the demand, being less of a burden to the existing transmission network, and contributing to prevention of global warming through clean combustion using novel energy technologies such as natural gas co-generation, natural gas micro turbines, or fuel cells. Distributed generations using renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy are also attracting attention. Regarding practical use of renewal energy in Japan, a new set of requirements advents. The first is the development of a set of policies for promoting power generated from renewable energy. The second is to evaluate the influence of distributed generations from renewable energy on the quality and reliability of the electricity. The third is the establishment of the technology requirements for interconnection with the power grid. The fourth is the development of future energy supply networks such as Power parks, Microgrids, and Smart grids. In implementing future energy supply networks utilizing renewable energy, power electronic devices are widely used to interface some forms of renewable energy generations and energy storages to distribution networks, and their use is likely to increase remarkably in the near future. The development of these power electronics is benefiting from the rapid advancements in the capability of power semiconductor switching devices and in the progress being made in the design and control of variable-speed drives for large motors. The most diffused application of power electronic devices is to invert the DC generated from some dispersed energy resources (e.g. photo voltaic fuel cells, micro turbines and battery storages) to existing 50/60 Hz AC. Also, power electronic devices are used to decouple rotating generates from the network and so potentially increase the efficiency of the operation of the prime mover by ensuring that they operate at their most efficient speed for the range of input power. For example, power electronics are used to support variable-speed wind turbines and are also now being proposed for some forms of small hydro-generation and energy storages during transients. In this article, we will discuss the role of power electronics for renewable energy utilizations and the kinds of infrastructure that should be designed and how this should be pursued in order to maintain high reliability and quality for future energy supply networks in the restructured electricity markets.","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.2008.928420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.2008.928420","startPage":"52","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/7384/4609953/04609963.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power electronics and its applications to renewable energy in Japan","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power electronics and its applications to renewable energy in Japan","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10185481","publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4609963/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power electronics and its applications to renewable energy in Japan","sourcePdf":"10_08mcas03-arai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116091S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"4609953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4609953","articleId":"4609963","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4609978,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Jun Ahn","affiliation":["Hiroshima City University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4609977/4609978/4609978-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang-Jun Ahn (M'01) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Japan, in 2003.","From 2001 to 2003, he was a Research Associate in the Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University.

CO-OFDM system has been successfully processed and recovered for transmitted signals without chromatic dispersion compensation. However, in optical links, the available optical power is limited due to safety and power consumption. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the minimizing the optical power and propose the CO-OFDM with punctured LDPC codes and variable amplitude block codes. In the proposed system, we consider the rate-compatible punctured code (RCPC) without erasing the coded bits corresponding to zeros in the puncturing pattern and assign them to the subcarriers. In this case, the transmission rate is not degraded compared to the original code. Moreover, the coded bits corresponding to zeros in the puncturing pattern are mapped with reduced amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to increase the transmission distance with reducing the required OSNR for satisfying the target BER.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.920138","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4609977/04609978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.920138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609977","startPage":"2227","endPage":"2234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Consumption for Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing With Punctured LDPC Codes and Variable Amplitude Block Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Consumption for Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing With Punctured LDPC Codes and Variable Amplitude Block Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"14","publicationDate":"July15, 2008","accessionNumber":"10185426","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4609978/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Consumption for Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing With Punctured LDPC Codes and Variable Amplitude Block Codes","sourcePdf":"26jlt14-ahn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042454S","chronDate":"July15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4609977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4609977","articleId":"4609978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4609983,"authors":[{"name":"Neda Cvijetic","affiliation":["Charles L.

To obtain the analytical results, the PMD channel is modeled as a linear time-invariant system, whose end-to-end transfer function is used to upper-bound symbol error and outage probabilities in IM/DD optical OFDM transmission. The symbol error rate bounds predicted by the general analytical model are verified experimentally on a 10-Gb/s OFDM system with instantaneous DGD ranging between Deltatau = 0 and 120 ps .

We further treat vector amplitude modulation over MMF MIMO and study the receiver zero-forcing (ZF) technique for MMF MIMO transmission, deriving its performance and comparing with a recently introduced ZF beamforming technique based on preceding at the transmitter, which is shown to be superior to receiver ZF.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.923230","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4609977/04609997.pdf","startPage":"2037","endPage":"2045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.923230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4609977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent Transmission Direct Detection MIMO Over Short-Range Optical Interconnects and Passive Optical Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4609997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4609997/","displayDocTitle":"Coherent Transmission Direct Detection MIMO Over Short-Range Optical Interconnects and Passive Optical Networks","volume":"26","issue":"14","publicationDate":"July15, 2008","accessionNumber":"10185444","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4609997/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent Transmission Direct Detection MIMO Over Short-Range Optical Interconnects and Passive Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"26jlt14-nazarathy2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09541S","chronDate":"July15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4609977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4609977","articleId":"4609997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
