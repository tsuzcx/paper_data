The inverters which are operated in this way are called static synchronous generators (SSG). This means that the well-established theory/device for synchronous generators can still be used for inverters, which will dominate the power generation in the future because of the increasing share of distributed generation sources and renewable energy sources utilised. The power of an SSG can be regulated using the well-known frequency and voltage drooping mechanism. SSGs can also be easily operated in grid-connected mode or island mode. Simulation results are given to verify the idea.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840013","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04840013.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static synchronous generators for distributed generation and renewable energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Static synchronous generators for distributed generation and renewable energy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840013/","publicationDate":"March 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10588651","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840013/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static synchronous generators for distributed generation and renewable energy","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040869S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4840021,"authors":[{"name":"E .

One of the most important tasks of independent system operator (ISO) is to manage congestion as it threatens system security and may cause rise in electricity price resulting in market inefficiency. In corrective action of congestion management schemes, it is crucial for ISO to select the most sensitive generators to re-schedule their real and reactive powers in congestion management. In this paper the optimal rescheduling of both real and reactive power to minimize the total congestion cost using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) is proposed. And the selection of most sensitive generators to re-dispatch both the real and reactive powers is done using transmission congestion distribution factors (TCDFs) [3, 17].

It predicts the development of cascading events by automatically identifying and visualizing potential cascading tiers. The proposed approach was implemented using a 50,000-bus Eastern Interconnection power system network. The results of the study indicate that initiating events and possible cascading chains may be quickly identified, ranked and visualized in on-line and offline environments.

Forecasted values of system load affect the decisions made for unit commitment and security assessment, which have a direct impact on operational costs and system security. Conventional regression methods are used by most power companies for load forecasting. However, due to the nonlinear relationship between load and factors affecting it, conventional methods are not sufficient enough to provide accurate load forecast or to consider the seasonal variations of load. Conventional ANN-based load forecasting methods deal with 24-hour-ahead load forecasting by using forecasted temperature, which can lead to high forecasting errors in case of rapid temperature changes. This paper presents a new neural network based approach for short-term load forecasting that uses the most correlated weather data for training, validating and testing the neural network. Correlation analysis of weather data determines the input parameters of the neural networks. The suitability of the proposed approach is illustrated through an application to the actual load data of the Egyptian Unified System.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840035","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04840035.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based approach for short-term load forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840035/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network based approach for short-term load forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840035/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10614327","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based approach for short-term load forecasting","confLoc":"Seattle, WA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07486S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4840047,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Transient stability is the dynamic behavior by which system security is assessed and classified. Critical clearing time (CCT) is used as security index for both feature extraction and classification of system dynamic security states. For the purpose of feature extraction, correlation between pre contingency operating condition and system dynamic characteristic is used. The proposed approach has been demonstrated on the IEEE-39 bus system with promising results for relatively accurate classification and screening of power system dynamic security.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840047","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04840047.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system dynamic security classification using Kohenen neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power system dynamic security classification using Kohenen neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10614332","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840047/","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system dynamic security classification using Kohenen neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04982S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4840050,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A complete system model based on a synchronously rotating reference frame for the studied WF combined with the SMES unit is properly derived and established. The proposed control scheme of the SMES unit is by means of adjusting phase angle of a bi-directional power converter using tie-line active-power deviation as a feedback signal.

In addition, using series capacitors (SCs) equipped with metal oxide varistors (MOVs) increases the protection relaying problems and complicates the trip decision. This paper presents a high impedance fault detection algorithm for maximum trip time required of 3/4 cycle. The proposed scheme implemented on two different models of HIF in extra high voltage double-ended transmission lines with series capacitors at the middle of the line. The scheme recognizes the distortion of the voltage waveforms caused by the arcs usually associated with HIFs. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based analysis, yields three phase voltages in high frequency range which are fed to Clarke's transformation to produce ground and aerial modes voltage components for pattern recognition. The classifier is based on an algorithm that uses recursive method to sum the absolute values of high frequency signals generated over one cycle and shifts one sample. Characteristics of the proposed scheme are fully analyzed by extensive ATP/EMTP simulation studies that clearly reveal that the proposed method can accurately detect HIFs in EHV transmission lines and does not affected by different fault conditions such as fault distance and fault inception angle.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840082","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04840082.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High impedance fault detection in EHV series compensated lines using the wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840082/","displayDocTitle":"High impedance fault detection in EHV series compensated lines using the wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614351","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840082/","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High impedance fault detection in EHV series compensated lines using the wavelet transform","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066785S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4840087,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A multi-agent application development will be discussed that involves agent specification, application analysis, application design and application realization. The message exchange in the proposed multi-agent system is designed to be compatible with an IP-based network (IP = Internet Protocol) which is based on the IEEE standard on Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agent (FIPA). The paper demonstrates the use of multi-agent systems to control a distributed smart grid in a simulated environment. The simulation results indicate that the proposed multi-agent system can facilitate the seamless transition from grid connected to an island mode when upstream outages are detected. This denotes the capability of a multi-agent system as a technology for managing the microgrid operation.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840087","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04840087.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840087","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-agent systems in a distributed smart grid: Design and implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-agent systems in a distributed smart grid: Design and implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840087/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840087/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614353","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-agent systems in a distributed smart grid: Design and implementation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057022S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"379","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4840097,"authors":[{"name":"Joe H.

In some places wind energy penetration is so high that the variation in wind energy production is the dominant driving force behind variation in the generation-load balance. To ensure a reliable supply of power, system operators must be able to schedule sufficient operating reserves. However, it is impractical to always supply 100% back-up for all generation units. Typically the N-1 criterion is applied, establishing the effect of the loss of the single largest generation unit. Wind energy compels different operating requirements, because failure of an entire wind energy project is improbable, but rapid variation in energy output is common. In such an environment, wind energy forecasting has significant value, especially during times of rapid change, and the use of a probabilistic forecast tool can minimize reserve requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840109/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614365","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Potential benefits of a dedicated probabilistic rapid ramp event forecast tool","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential benefits of a dedicated probabilistic rapid ramp event forecast tool","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056097S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4840110,"authors":[{"name":"Cameron W.

Linear analysis and time domain simulations illustrate the performance of these PSS designs when applied to selected SVCs in the Norwegian power transmission grid. Utilizing remote signals available recently through wide area monitoring systems enables selection of the best feedback control signal with highest modal observability of the modes of interest.

Critical clearing time (CCT) associated with each fault including the effect of system controllers and limitation, is adopted as dynamic security criteria. A Dynamic Security Analyzer Neural Network (DSANN) is trained to estimate CCTs associated with different system faults. For each given operating point, DSANN evaluate system CCTs by using steady state pre fault operating condition as input pattern. The most interesting feature of the proposed neural network application is evaluation of sensitivity of CCT with respect to generation pattern. These sensitivities are derived from the information stored in the weighting factors of trained DSANN. The sensitivity of CCT is used as a guideline for selecting the most effective pair of generators to reschedule their MW generation in the process of generation rescheduling aimed security enhancement. The proposed method has been demonstrated on the IEEE-39 bus system with promising results for enhancing dynamic security by generation rescheduling using sensitivity characteristic of neural network.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840172","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04840172.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic security constrained rescheduling using stability sensitivities by neural network as a preventive tool","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840172/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic security constrained rescheduling using stability sensitivities by neural network as a preventive tool","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840172/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10614395","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic security constrained rescheduling using stability sensitivities by neural network as a preventive tool","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054893S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4840197,"authors":[{"name":"Roozbeh Emami","firstName":"Roozbeh","lastName":"Emami","id":"37602850500"},{"name":"Ali Abur","firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Abur","id":"37272386300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3810-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3811-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4840197","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phasor measurement units","Observability","Current measurement","Monitoring","Transformers","Voltage measurement","Power system measurements","Substations","State estimation","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic meter reading","power system state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronized phasor measurements","network branches","substation","observability","state estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["State estimation","phasor measurements","network observability","meter placement","contingencies","critical measurements"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840197","abstract":"This paper presents a practical approach to assign synchronized phasor measurements to appropriate network branches in order to observe the entire system. Earlier studies assume that phasor measurement units are capable of monitoring all branch currents incident to the studied substation. This paper relaxes this unrealistic assumption and considers more practical phasor measurement units which can monitor individual lines or transformers. While the paper considers an initially blank measurement set and proposes a method to populate the system branches with phasor measurement units, it can be used to simply extend observability of unobservable systems equipped with conventional metering. Furthermore, the objective of the placement problem is expanded to incorporate the reliability against loss of phasor measurement units or unexpected outage of lines and transformers. Hence, the resulting method provides a comprehensive measurement configuration which not only makes the system observable but maintains observability during such contingencies. Numerical results of applying this method to IEEE test systems are given.","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840197","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815087/4839920/04840197.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable placement of synchronized phasor measurements on network branches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reliable placement of synchronized phasor measurements on network branches","conferenceDate":"15-18 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840197/","accessionNumber":"10588734","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840197/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable placement of synchronized phasor measurements on network branches","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"PSCE2009-000672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041159S","chronDate":"15-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4815087","isNumber":"4839920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815087","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4839920","articleId":"4840197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4840222,"authors":[{"name":"Lingfeng Wang","affiliation":["The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280770900"},{"name":"Chanan Singh","affiliation":["The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chanan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37271764800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3810-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3811-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4840222","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system reliability","Power system simulation","Genetic algorithms","Concurrent computing","Computational modeling","Stochastic processes","Load flow","Computational efficiency","Topology","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","load flow","power system reliability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite power system reliability evaluation","parallel genetic algorithms","stochastic search mechanism","load flow calculation","parallel computation","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Monte Carlo simulation","parallel computation","reliability evaluation","master-slave parallelization","computational efficiency","loss of load probability","hash table"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840222","abstract":"Genetic algorithm (GA) has shown its promise in dealing with reliability evaluation of complex power systems.

In this paper, we propose an optimization method based on genetic algorithm that can optimize the two parameters associated with high frequency voltage signal; namely injected frequency and injected voltage. A highly accurate finite element based phase variable model is utilized for the machine model.

The underlying system models and time series data generating processes are generally complex for these applications and the models for these systems are usually not known a priori. Accurate and unbiased estimation of the time series data produced by these systems cannot always be achieved using well known linear techniques, and thus the estimation process requires more advanced time series prediction algorithms. This paper provides a survey of time series prediction applications using a novel machine learning approach: support vector machines (SVM). The underlying motivation for using SVMs is the ability of this methodology to accurately forecast time series data when the underlying system processes are typically nonlinear, non-stationary and not defined a-priori. SVMs have also been proven to outperform other non-linear techniques including neural-network based non-linear prediction techniques such as multi-layer perceptrons.The ultimate goal is to provide the reader with insight into the applications using SVM for time series prediction, to give a brief tutorial on SVMs for time series prediction, to outline some of the advantages and challenges in using SVMs for time series prediction, and to provide a source for the reader to locate books, technical journals, and other online SVM research resources.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2009.932254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2009.932254","startPage":"24","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/4840310/04840324.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4840310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Series Prediction Using Support Vector Machines: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Time Series Prediction Using Support Vector Machines: A Survey","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10588605","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840324/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Series Prediction Using Support Vector Machines: A Survey","sourcePdf":"14-04mci02-sapankevych.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199629S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"4840310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"527","xplore-issue":"4840310","articleId":"4840324","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4840325,"authors":[{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, USA","Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Fei-Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37277656000"},{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, China"],"firstName":"Huaguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792300"},{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Derong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277008500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"4840325","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":557,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":8805},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840325","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Iterative algorithms","Nonlinear systems","Stability","Cost function","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Optimal control","Time varying systems","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","dynamic programming","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive dynamic programming","approximate dynamic programming","iterative algorithms","system stability","convergence analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we introduce some recent research trends within the field of adaptive/approximate dynamic programming (ADP), including the variations on the structure of ADP schemes, the development of ADP algorithms and applications of ADP schemes. For ADP algorithms, the point of focus is that iterative algorithms of ADP can be sorted into two classes: one class is the iterative algorithm with initial stable policy; the other is the one without the requirement of initial stable policy. It is generally believed that the latter one has less computation at the cost of missing the guarantee of system stability during iteration process. In addition, many recent papers have provided convergence analysis associated with the algorithms developed.

Unlike isosurfaces, they are able to capture extremal structures in the data. Creases have a long tradition in image processing and computer vision, and have recently become a popular tool for visualization. When extracting crease surfaces, degeneracies of the Hessian (i.e., lines along which two eigenvalues are equal) have so far been ignored. We show that these loci, however, have two important consequences for the topology of crease surfaces: First, creases are bounded not only by a side constraint on eigenvalue sign, but also by Hessian degeneracies. Second, crease surfaces are not, in general, orientable. We describe an efficient algorithm for the extraction of crease surfaces which takes these insights into account and demonstrate that it produces more accurate results than previous approaches. Finally, we show that diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) stream surfaces, which were previously used for the analysis of planar regions in diffusion tensor MRI data, are mathematically ill-defined. As an example application of our method, creases in a measure of planarity are presented as a viable substitute.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.44","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5331922/04840340.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"119","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crease Surfaces: From Theory to Extraction and Application to Diffusion Tensor MRI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Crease Surfaces: From Theory to Extraction and Application to Diffusion Tensor MRI","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4840340/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"10975604","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","pubMedId":"19910665","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crease Surfaces: From Theory to Extraction and Application to Diffusion Tensor MRI","sourcePdf":"ttg2010010109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094777S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5331922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5331922","articleId":"4840340","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4840346,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Meditskos","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Meditskos","id":"37947807500"},{"name":"Nick Bassiliades","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Bassiliades","id":"37427527300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-4347"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2191"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3865"}],"articleNumber":"4840346","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1291},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural and Role-Oriented Web Service Discovery with Taxonomies in OWL-S","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840346","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Taxonomy","Ontologies","Semantic Web","Information retrieval","OWL","Collaboration","Humans","XML","Intelligent agent"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","semantic Web","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["role-oriented Web service discovery","OWL-S","semantic Web service descriptions","service profile ontology","fine-grained discovery approaches","Web service matchmaking algorithm","object-based matching techniques","structural case-based reasoning","domain-dependent discovery","profile taxonomies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web service discovery","abstract descriptions","OWL-S profile","structural information","role-oriented matchmaking."]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we describe and evaluate a Web service discovery framework using OWL-S advertisements, combined with the distinction between service and Web service of the WSMO discovery framework. More specifically, we follow the Web service discovery model, which is based on abstract and lightweight semantic Web service descriptions, using the service profile ontology of OWL-S. Our goal is to determine fast an initial set of candidate Web services for a specific request. This set can then be used in more fine-grained discovery approaches, based on richer Web service descriptions. Our Web service matchmaking algorithm extends object-based matching techniques used in structural case-based reasoning, allowing 1) the retrieval of Web services not only based on subsumption relationships, but exploiting also the structural information of OWL ontologies and 2) the exploitation of Web services classification in profile taxonomies, performing domain-dependent discovery. Furthermore, we describe how the typical paradigm of profile input/output annotation with ontology concepts can be extended, allowing ontology roles to be considered as well. We have implemented our framework in the OWLS-SLR system, which we extensively evaluate and compare to the OWLS-MX matchmaker.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.89","startPage":"278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5370713/04840346.pdf","endPage":"290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5370713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.89","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840346/","displayDocTitle":"Structural and Role-Oriented Web Service Discovery with Taxonomies in OWL-S","volume":"22","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840346/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11037335","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural and Role-Oriented Web Service Discovery with Taxonomies in OWL-S","sourcePdf":"ttk2010020278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037121S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","isNumber":"5370713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"60","articleId":"4840346","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4840349,"authors":[{"name":"Huiwen Zeng","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5394981/4840349/4840349-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huiwen Zeng received the BEng degree in electrical engineering from Sichuan University, China, the MS degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University.

Since the dimensionality of a classification problem is equivalent to the number of neurons in the first hidden layer of a network, this work shows how to eliminate neurons on that layer and simplify the problem. In the cases where the dimensionality cannot be reduced without some degradation in classification performance, we formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that allows a trade-off between dimensionality and performance. We introduce a novel penalty function and combine it with bilevel optimization to solve the constrained problem. The performance of our method on synthetic and applied problems is superior to other known penalty functions such as weight decay, weight elimination, and Hoyer's function. An example of dimensionality reduction for hyperspectral image classification demonstrates the practicality of the new method.

Multicast services, such as audio/video streaming and mobile television, have the characteristic that the same information has to be transmitted to a group of recipients, which may include user terminals as well as relay stations, in the case of relaying networks. This paper deals with the problem of multigroup multicast beamforming for multiantenna wireless cellular networks, which assumes that multiple multicast groups can share the same resource. The intergroup interference, which appears due to the resource sharing, needs to be suppressed by the beamforming algorithms. In this paper, new linear transmit beamforming techniques are proposed, which aim to provide a reasonable tradeoff between performance and computational complexity. These techniques correspond to extensions of known algorithms, such as zero forcing (ZF), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing, to the multicast case. Furthermore, new ldquomulticast-awarerdquo techniques that take into account the peculiarities of multicast transmission are proposed to improve performance. To provide the necessary mathematical framework for the analysis, a novel general multigroup multicast system model is proposed as well.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04840357.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","startPage":"4353","endPage":"4367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Transmit Beamforming Techniques for the Multigroup Multicast Scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear Transmit Beamforming Techniques for the Multigroup Multicast Scenario","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903051","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840357/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Transmit Beamforming Techniques for the Multigroup Multicast Scenario","sourcePdf":"tvt-silva-2021603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118668S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4840357","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840358,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong-Sang Kim","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5337733/4840358/4840358-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byeong-Sang Kim received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2004 from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering.","His current research interests include redundant actuation."]},"firstName":"Byeong-Sang","lastName":"Kim","id":"37290151200"},{"name":"Jae-Bok Song","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5337733/4840358/4840358-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jae-Bok Song (M\u201900) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1983 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 1992.","In 1993, he joined the faculty of the School of Mechanical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea, where he is currently the Director of the Intelligent Robotics Research Center.

Although these methods have been successfully applied to many applications, simultaneous control of force and position cannot be achieved. To cope with such problems, this paper proposes a novel design of a dual actuator unit (DAU) composed of two actuators and a planetary gear train to provide the capability of simultaneous control of position and stiffness. Since one actuator controls position and the other actuator modulates stiffness, the DAU can control the position and stiffness simultaneously at the same joint. Both the torque exerted on the joint and the stiffness of the environment can be estimated without an expensive force sensor. Various experiments demonstrate that the DAU can provide good performance for position tracking, force estimation, and environment estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840358/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840358/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10977553","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Serial-Type Dual Actuator Unit With Planetary Gear Train: Basic Design and Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Serial-Type Dual Actuator Unit With Planetary Gear Train: Basic Design and Applications","sourcePdf":"tmech-song-2019639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1068S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5337733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5337733","articleId":"4840358","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4840361,"authors":[{"name":"Sairam Prabhakar","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5062320/4840361/4840361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sairam Prabhakar received the B.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India, in 2002, and the M.Eng. degree from the University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada, in 2005.

Accompanying this increase in sophistication is a corresponding need to develop accurate analytical models to predict the dynamic properties of such resonators. Here, we present an analytical framework to compute thermoelastic damping (TED) in the general class of microresonators characterized by structural discontinuities in the form of slots or internal channels. The temperature field within the resonators is obtained by solving the one-way coupled equation of thermoelastic heat conduction in a piecewise fashion, thereby capturing the effects of structural discontinuities interrupting heat conduction within the beam. The framework is validated by comparison with previously reported finite-element analysis and measurements of damping in slotted microresonators. The analysis leads to an expression for TED in the form of rapidly converging infinite series, and accurate closed-form expressions are obtained by retaining the leading terms. These simple formulas enable a rapid exploration of the design space over a full range of parameters, as illustrated for the case of hollow single-crystal-silicon beams containing internal channels. For constant channel volume, the peak value of TED reduces monotonically with the ratio of channel width to channel height. The analysis is used to identify designs that reduce TED to values that are less than 2 times 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n at all frequencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840361/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10712727","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermoelastic Damping in Hollow and Slotted Microresonators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermoelastic Damping in Hollow and Slotted Microresonators","sourcePdf":"jmems-vengallatore-2016287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065279S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5062320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5062320","articleId":"4840361","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4840366,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Ren Peng","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4840636/4840366/4840366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Ren Peng was born in HsinChu, Taiwan, in 1978.

By inserting an RF tone at the edge of the signal band and biasing the Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) at the null point, the proposed system has a better sensitivity and chromatic dispersion (CD) tolerance compared to the previous intensity-modulated single-sideband OFDM (SSB-OFDM). We show analytically that the majority of the linear channel impairments, such as the transmitter, CD, optical filtering, and receiver, can be compensated for by a simple zero-forcing equalizer. Besides, the optimum value of the important parameter, carrier-to-signal-power ratio (CSPR), is analytically obtained and supported via the experimental results. We also observe that the relatively worse sensitivity of the previous SSB-OFDM can be attributed to the limited CSPR. We experimentally demonstrate a 10-Gb/s, 8 quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) RF-tone-assisted OFDM transmission, and show that our system has a ~ 5-dB better sensitivity compared to the previous intensity-modulated SSB-OFDM and exhibits a negligible transmission penalty after 260-km uncompensated standard single-mode fiber (SSMF).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Direct-Detected RF-Tone-Assisted Optical OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2012172","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4840636/04840366.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2012172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4840636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Direct-Detected RF-Tone-Assisted Optical OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4840366/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"May15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10660609","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Direct-Detected RF-Tone-Assisted Optical OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-wpeng-2012172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060142S","chronDate":"May15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4840636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"4840636","articleId":"4840366","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840367,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Ren Peng","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4840636/4840367/4840367-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Ren Peng was born in HsinChu, Taiwan, in 1978.

The individual BER of each subcarrier is first computed by considering their electrical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and then the ensemble BER is derived simply by taking the average of all the subcarriers' BERs. The calculated BER is verified by the conventional error-counting approach with high precision and is still accurate with higher quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM) formats, even under the influences of the optical filtering and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) effects. Based on our simulation approach, the required extra power budget for 16- and 64-QAM relative to 4-QAM format are found to be ~3.8 and 8.2 dB, respectively, at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n. Furthermore, we use this approach to compare the receiving sensitivities and PMD tolerances for the previous proposed gapped and interleaved radio-frequency (RF)-tone-assisted OFDM systems. The results show that the gapped OFDM has a better sensitivity while the interleaved OFDM has a more PMD-tolerable capability.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4840636/04840367.pdf","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1346","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2012173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2012173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4840636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of the Bit Error Rate for Direct-Detected OFDM Signals With Optically Preamplified Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Bit error rate","OFDM","Optical filters","Optical sensors","Estimation error","Frequency estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-optical filters","electro-optical modulation","error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre filters","optical fibre polarisation","optical receivers","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error rate estimation","direct-detected OFDM system","optically preamplified receiver","quadratic-amplitude modulation","optical filtering","polarization mode dispersion","radio-frequency-tone-assisted OFDM system","optical fibre communication","electrical signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","direct detection","optical fiber communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","optical modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of the Bit Error Rate for Direct-Detected OFDM Signals With Optically Preamplified Receivers","volume":"27","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4840367/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10628152","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of the Bit Error Rate for Direct-Detected OFDM Signals With Optically Preamplified Receivers","sourcePdf":"jlt-wpeng-2012173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0737S","chronDate":"May15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4840636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4840636","articleId":"4840367","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840381,"authors":[{"name":"Jeich Mar","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5159565/4840381/4840381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeich Mar (M'94\u2013SM'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Chun-Cheng Institute, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 1970, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1974, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1981.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Communications Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan.

The prototype offers four concurrent channels with a throughput of 4.8 kb/s. The main focus is the future implantability of such a miniaturized system for the medical long-term surveillance of patients. To achieve this goal, small circuit size, low power consumption, and electrical safety have to carefully be considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","volume":"58","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10774769","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840382/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Galvanic Coupling Enabling Wireless Implant Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Galvanic Coupling Enabling Wireless Implant Communications","sourcePdf":"tim-wegmueller-2015639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07959S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5159565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5159565","articleId":"4840382","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4840393,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Lethien","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique, de Micro\u00e9lectronique et de Nanotechnologie (IEMN), Universit\u00e9 des Sciences et Technologies de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4840636/4840393/4840393-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christophe Lethien was born in France, on May 3, 1978.

After the design of a test setup operating at 850 nm, we have performed the physical characterization of the ROF system especially the mask test compliance, the error vector magnitude (EVM), or the relative constellation error (RCE) variation as a function of the system parameters [radio frequency (RF) power, optical attenuation, fiber length, laser bias current]. The transmission performance of both 200 and 480 Mb/s Wimedia signals is demonstrated through a 100 m link length of glass- and polymer-based multimode fibers: transmission penalties are quantified by RCE with values under the standard requirements. Two different behaviors depending on the core material of the fiber have been identified in this study.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4840636/04840393.pdf","startPage":"1320","endPage":"1331","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2013217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2013217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4840636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of Glass and Polymer Multimode Fibers Used in a Wimedia Ultrawideband MB-OFDM Radio Over Fiber System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Glass","Polymers","Ultra wideband technology","Optical fiber testing","System testing","Radio frequency","Optical attenuators","OFDM","Optical design","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor communication","OFDM modulation","optical fibre testing","optical glass","optical modulation","optical polymers","radio-over-fibre","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["glass-based multimode fiber","polymer-based multimode fiber","radio-over-fiber system","Wimedia multiband OFDM","MB-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultrawideband standard","ROF system","mask test compliance","error vector magnitude","EVM","relative constellation error","RCE","wavelength 850 nm","bit rate 200 Mbit/s","bit rate 480 Mbit/s","size 100 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error vector magnitude (EVM)","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM)","polymer fiber","radio over multimode fiber","relative constellation error (RCE)","ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Review of Glass and Polymer Multimode Fibers Used in a Wimedia Ultrawideband MB-OFDM Radio Over Fiber System","volume":"27","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4840393/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10628156","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Glass and Polymer Multimode Fibers Used in a Wimedia Ultrawideband MB-OFDM Radio Over Fiber System","sourcePdf":"jlt-clethien-2013217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089649S","chronDate":"May15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4840636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4840636","articleId":"4840393","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840396,"authors":[{"name":"Giang Hoang Nguyen","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Electromagnetism and Photonics, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4957554/4840396/4840396-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giang Hoang Nguyen was born in Phu Tho, Vietnam, in 1980.

Moreover, the grinding production rate needs to be maximized. However, due to the complex dynamic characteristics between the above two indices and the control loops, such control objectives are difficult to achieve using existing control methods. The complexity is reflected by the existence of process heavy nonlinearities, strong coupling and large time variations. As a result, the lower level loop control with human supervision is still widely used in practice. However, since the setpoints to the involved control loops cannot be accurately adjusted under the variations of the boundary conditions, the manual setpoints control cannot ensure that the actual production indices meet with technical requirements all the time. In this paper, an intelligent optimal-setting control (IOSC) approach is developed for a typical two-stage GC so as to optimize the production indices by auto-adjusting on line the setpoints of the control loops in response to the changes in boundary conditions. This IOSC approach integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) pre-setting controlling, neural network (NN)-based soft-sensor and fuzzy adjusting into one efficient control model. Although each control element is well known, their innovative combination can generate better and more reliable performance. Both industrial experiments and applications show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed IOSC approach and its bright application foreground in industrial processes with similar features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840415/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10870545","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Optimal-Setting Control for Grinding Circuits of Mineral Processing Process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Optimal-Setting Control for Grinding Circuits of Mineral Processing Process","sourcePdf":"tase-pzhou-2011562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113923S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5233432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5233432","articleId":"4840415","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4840417,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Since the total traveling time is not always restrictive as a time window constraint, the objective regarded in this paper comprises not only the cost due to the total traveling distance, but also the cost due to the total traveling time. We propose to use a stochastic search technique called fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms (FLGA) to solve the problem. The role of fuzzy logic is to dynamically adjust the crossover rate and mutation rate after ten consecutive generations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLGA, a number of benchmark problems are used to examine its search performance. Also, several search methods, branch and bound, standard GA (i.e., without the guide of fuzzy logic), simulated annealing, and tabu search, are adopted to compare with FLGA in randomly generated data sets. Simulation results show that FLGA outperforms other search methods in all of three various scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840417/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11220569","htmlLink":"/document/4840417/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of Genetic Algorithms to Solve the Multidepot Vehicle Routing Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Genetic Algorithms to Solve the Multidepot Vehicle Routing Problem","sourcePdf":"tase-wtsui-2019265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131662S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5443442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5443442","articleId":"4840417","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840429,"authors":[{"name":"Yuliya Tarabalka","affiliation":["GIPSA-Lab, Grenoble Institute of Technology (INPG), Saint Martin d'Heres, France","Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5165150/4840429/4840429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuliya Tarabalka (S'08) received the B.S. degree in computer science from the Ternopil Ivan Pul'uj State Technical University, Ternopil, Ukraine, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree in signal and image processing from the Grenoble Institute of Technology (INPG), Grenoble, France, in 2007.

The proposed method performs particularly well for classification of images with large spatial structures and when different classes have dissimilar spectral responses and a comparable number of pixels.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2016214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2016214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5165150/04840429.pdf","startPage":"2973","endPage":"2987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery Based on Partitional Clustering Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery Based on Partitional Clustering Techniques","volume":"47","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840429/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764078","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840429/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery Based on Partitional Clustering Techniques","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tarabalka-2016214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189993S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5165150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"507","xplore-issue":"5165150","articleId":"4840429","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4840438,"authors":[{"name":"Tai-Chien Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5153550/4840438/4840438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tai-Chien Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","In 2008, he joined the Chinese Air Force.

By relaxing the maximum cross-correlation values to two, the new 2-D codes provide larger code cardinality for accommodating more subscribers and support heavier code weight for better code performance. It is known that the traditional chip-synchronous assumption used in the analyses of optical codes gives a pessimistic performance upper bound, while the newer chip-asynchronous assumption offers a more accurate analysis. The performance of the new 2-D codes is here analyzed under both assumptions for comparison. Under certain conditions, our results show that the new wavelength-time codes outperform our recently reported multiple-wavelength OOCs and 2-D codes, which were based on 1-D OOCs of cross-correlation functions of at most one and two, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Performance analysis","Optical network units","Multiple access interference","Upper bound","Bandwidth","Councils","Wireless communication","Optical fiber communication","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical fibre communication","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber-optic CDMA systems","chip-synchronous assumption","wavelength-time codes","one-dimensional optical orthogonal codes","cross-correlation functions","2-D codes","1-D OOC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chip-asynchronous","fiber-optic code-division multiple access (CDMA)","optical orthogonal codes","2-D wavelength-time codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840438","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2013367","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5153550/04840438.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2013367","startPage":"2612","endPage":"2620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153550","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Family of 2-D Codes for Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems With and Without the Chip-Synchronous Assumption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Family of 2-D Codes for Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems With and Without the Chip-Synchronous Assumption","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840438/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","volume":"27","issue":"14","htmlLink":"/document/4840438/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"July15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10773854","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Family of 2-D Codes for Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems With and Without the Chip-Synchronous Assumption","sourcePdf":"jlt-wang-2013367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102329S","chronDate":"July15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5153550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5153550","articleId":"4840438","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4840440,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Ching Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5170177/4840440/4840440-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Po-Ching Lin (M'05) received the B.S. degree in computer and information education from National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2008, respectively.","His research interests include content networking, algorithm designing and embedded hardware software codesign."]},"firstName":"Po-Ching","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291467200"},{"name":"Yin-Dar Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5170177/4840440/4840440-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ying-Dar Lin (SM'06) received the B.S. degree in computer science and information engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1988, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 1990 and 1993, respectively.","He joined the faculty of the Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in August 1993 and has been a Professor since 1999.

By use of digital signal processing, transmission performance of such optical links can be improved. Among the different technical solutions proposed, a promising one is based on the use of discrete multitone (DMT) modulation, directly applied to intensity-modulated, direct detection (IM/DD) SI-POF links. This paper presents an overview of DMT over SI-POF and demonstrates how DMT can be used to improve transmission rate in such IM/DD systems. The achievable capacity of an SI-POF channel is first analyzed theoretically and then validated by experimental results. Additionally, first experimental demonstrations of a real-time DMT over SI-POF system are presented and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete Multitone Modulation for Maximizing Transmission Rate in Step-Index Plastic Optical Fibers","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2013480","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4957554/04840445.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2013480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Discrete Multitone Modulation for Maximizing Transmission Rate in Step-Index Plastic Optical Fibers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4840445/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10664107","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete Multitone Modulation for Maximizing Transmission Rate in Step-Index Plastic Optical Fibers","sourcePdf":"jlt-lee-2013480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112992S","chronDate":"June1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4957554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4957554","articleId":"4840445","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840450,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Liang Chen photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280387000"},{"name":"Zhongxi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Zhongxi Zhang is a Research Associate in the Physics Department, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.

In this paper, we propose a generic spectrum-surveying framework that introduces both standardization and automation to this process, as well as enables a distributed approach to spectrum surveying. The proposed framework outlines procedures for the collection, analysis, and modeling of spectrum measurements. Furthermore, we propose two techniques for processing spectrum data without the need for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n knowledge. In addition, these techniques overcome the challenges associated with spectrum data processing, such as a large dynamic range of signals and the variation of the signal-to-noise ratio across the spectrum. Finally, we present mathematical tools for the analysis and extraction of important spectrum occupancy parameters. The proposed processing techniques have been validated using empirical spectrum measurements collected from the FM, television (TV), cellular, and paging bands. Results show that the primary signals in the FM band can be classified with a miss-detection rate of about 2% at the cost of 50% false-alarm rate, while nearly 100% reliability in classification can be achieved with the other bands. However, the classification accuracy depends on the duration and the range of frequencies over which data are collected, as well as the RF characteristics of the spectrum measurement receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spectrum Surveying Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04840476.pdf","startPage":"4158","endPage":"4168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Spectrum Surveying Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4840476/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903054","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spectrum Surveying Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wyglinski-2021601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092383S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4840476","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4840478,"authors":[{"name":"Siva D.

The proposed SIQR-GR scheme recursively processes data decisions corresponding to the SFBC groups within each OFDM block to improve system performance under doubly selective channels. Furthermore, the avoidance of square roots and the utilization of scaled Givens rotations ensure that the proposed SIQR-GR scheme is computationally efficient. Second, we derive semianalytical expressions for the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance of SIQR-GR and verify the accuracy of the NMSE analysis via numerical simulations. Finally, we provide performance and complexity comparisons between SIQR-GR and previously proposed schemes.

In the considered system, downlink multiuser interference (MUI) is suppressed with the aid of transmitter preprocessing operated at the base station (BS). Two transmitter preprocessing schemes are considered, which are operated in the principles of transmitter zero forcing (TZF) and transmitter minimum mean square error (TMMSE). At the MTs, signals received from the BS and relays are combined based on the principles of maximal ratio combining (MRC) or maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR). In this paper, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the relay-assisted DS-CDMA downlink is investigated when the communication channels are assumed to experience both propagation path loss and generalized Nakagami- \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n fading.

The proposed setup has the original capability of characterizing device degradation under a nonlinear dynamic operation. Such information is invaluable when the success of a project is inherently related to the end-of-life performance of each system component (e.g., military and space applications). Some previous works underline the importance of such information, but they are not oriented to device characterization and, moreover, are focused on a particular application (e.g., power amplifier design). The commonly adopted measurement techniques, which are essentially focused on high-field static operations, are extremely useful to perform accelerated stress, but they cannot be adopted to obtain exhaustive information about the time dispersion of device characteristics under realistic operative conditions. Through the proposed system, the stress procedure can be carried out under static (DC) and nonlinear dynamic (RF) operations to give the maximum flexibility in gathering useful information on the device degradation in different operating regimes. In particular, the device under test (DUT) is fed in rf-stressing conditions by applying a large-amplitude excitation signal at moderately high frequency at either the input (forward mode) or output (reverse mode) port of the device. The system features, in fact, a symmetrical dual-channel architecture. The DUT can be either a bipolar- or a field-effect transistor, and the walkout of its characteristics can be observed both at the end of the stress test and in real-time during the test execution. A special-purpose control software automates the measured data acquisition. Several experiments that were performed using the proposed setup are discussed in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2015696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2015696","startPage":"2663","endPage":"2670","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5159565/04840483.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automated Measurement System for the Characterization of Electron Device Degradation Under Nonlinear Dynamic Regime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Automated Measurement System for the Characterization of Electron Device Degradation Under Nonlinear Dynamic Regime","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840483/","accessionNumber":"10774737","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840483/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automated Measurement System for the Characterization of Electron Device Degradation Under Nonlinear Dynamic Regime","sourcePdf":"tim-raffo-2015696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074499S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5159565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5159565","articleId":"4840483","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4840487,"authors":[{"name":"Kaptan Teotrakool","affiliation":["Naval Electron.

The performance of the network suffers as the number of nodes grows, and a large sensor network quickly becomes difficult to manage. Thus, it is essential that the network be able to self-organize. Clustering is an efficient approach to simplify the network structure and to alleviate the scalability problem. One method to create clusters is to use weakly connected dominating sets (WCDSs). Finding the minimum WCDS in an arbitrary graph is an NP-complete problem. We propose a neural network model to find the minimum WCDS in a wireless sensor network. We present a directed convergence algorithm. The new algorithm outperforms the normal convergence algorithm both in efficiency and in the quality of solutions. Moreover, it is shown that the neural network is robust. We investigate the scalability of the neural network model by testing it on a range of sized graphs and on a range of transmission radii. Compared with Guha and Khuller's centralized algorithm, the proposed neural network with directed convergency achieves better results when the transmission radius is short, and equal performance when the transmission radius becomes larger. The parallel version of the neural network model takes time \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n) , where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n is the maximal degree in the graph corresponding to the sensor network, while the centralized algorithm takes \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n). We also investigate the effect of the transmission radius on the size of WCDS. The results show that it is important to select a suitable transmission radius to make the network stable and to extend the lifespan of the network. The proposed model can be used on sink nodes in sensor networks, so that a sink node can inform the nodes to be a coordinator (clusterhead) in the WCDS obtained by the algorithm. Thus, the message overhead is \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

We propose a novel associative memory that satisfies these requirements. Using the proposed method, new associative pairs that are presented sequentially can be learned accurately without forgetting previously learned patterns. The memory size of the proposed method increases adaptively with learning patterns. Therefore, it suffers neither redundancy nor insufficiency of memory size, even in an environment in which the maximum number of associative pairs to be presented is unknown before learning. Noisy inputs in real environments are classifiable into two types: noise-added original patterns and faultily presented random patterns. The proposed method deals with two types of noise. To our knowledge, no conventional associative memory addresses noise of both types. The proposed associative memory performs as a bidirectional one-to-many or many-to-one associative memory and deals not only with bipolar data, but also with real-valued data. Results demonstrate that the proposed method's features are important for application to an intelligent robot operating in a real environment. The originality of our work consists of two points: employing a growing self-organizing network for an associative memory, and discussing what features are necessary for an associative memory for an intelligent robot and proposing an associative memory that satisfies those requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2014374","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5062541/04840492.pdf","startPage":"964","endPage":"972","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2014374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Associative Memory for Online Learning in Noisy Environments Using Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Associative Memory for Online Learning in Noisy Environments Using Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10713252","pubMedId":"19398402","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840492/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associative Memory for Online Learning in Noisy Environments Using Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tnn-sudo-2014374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074545S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5062541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5062541","articleId":"4840492","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4840493,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5230374/4840493/4840493-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Min Lin (S'86\u2013M'87\u2013SM'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 1981, 1983, and 1986, respectively.","From 1986 to 1992, he was a Deputy Director of System Engineering of Missile Systems at the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology.

Extension is achieved by expressing the link outage probability in terms of the statistics of the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). This permits evidencing the role of the number of allocated subcarriers per slot on planning. The exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM) method is adopted. A closed-form expression for the link outage probability is achieved assuming a Gaussian approximation for the derivation of the statistics of the EESM-based SINR. This formula is then used to set up a simple planning procedure requiring the evaluation of only two averages of the SINR calculated on a generic subcarrier. The effectiveness of the proposed approximation with the number of allocated subcarriers per slot is investigated. An upper bound of the link outage probability in the presence of interference is provided. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is applied to the calculation of the network parameters for the typical two-cell interference scenario. It is shown that the considered approximation provides results with accuracy within 1 dB for a number of subcarriers greater than ten and for an outage performance target of 5%.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04840495.pdf","startPage":"4204","endPage":"4213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimensioning of OFDM/OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks Using Exponential Effective SINR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840495/","displayDocTitle":"Dimensioning of OFDM/OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks Using Exponential Effective SINR","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903050","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840495/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensioning of OFDM/OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks Using Exponential Effective SINR","sourcePdf":"tvt-mazzenga-2021523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084174S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4840495","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840496,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yang Chen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5200771/4840496/4840496-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Yang Chen (S'05) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, on Nov. 22, 1977.

A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the waveforms and receiving filters such that the detection performance can be maximized. The corresponding iterative algorithms are also developed for the case where only the statistics or the uncertainty set of the target impulse response is available. These algorithms guarantee that the SINR performance improves in each iteration step.

A novel self-biased resistive- feedback topology is proposed. Two inductors inside the feedback loop and a shunt-peaking inductor are exploited to extend the bandwidth. A PMOSFET with inductive degeneration is chosen as the load to boost the gain while maintaining low noise figure (NF) at high frequencies. A source-degeneration inductor is also introduced at the input transistor to ensure good input matching and stability over the entire bandwidth.

We first propose a generative model of joint BSS based on the correlation of latent sources within and between datasets. We specify source separability conditions, and show that, when the conditions are satisfied, the group of corresponding sources from each dataset can be jointly extracted by M-CCA through maximization of correlation among the extracted sources. We compare source separation performance of the M-CCA scheme with other joint BSS methods and demonstrate the superior performance of the M-CCA scheme in achieving joint BSS for a large number of datasets, group of corresponding sources with heterogeneous correlation values, and complex-valued sources with circular and non-circular distributions. We apply M-CCA to analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from multiple subjects and show its utility in estimating meaningful brain activations from a visuomotor task.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2021636","startPage":"3918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04840522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2021636","endPage":"3929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Blind Source Separation by Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Blind Source Separation by Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4840522/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10869466","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","pubMedId":"20221319","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Blind Source Separation by Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-yli-2021636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167242S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4840522","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840525,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Haykin","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4919177/4840525/4840525-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Simon Haykin (Life Fellow, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

This paper surveys the fundamental capacity limits and associated transmission techniques for different wireless network design paradigms based on this promising technology. These paradigms are unified by the definition of a cognitive radio as an intelligent wireless communication device that exploits side information about its environment to improve spectrum utilization. This side information typically comprises knowledge about the activity, channels, codebooks, and/or messages of other nodes with which the cognitive node shares the spectrum. Based on the nature of the available side information as well as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n rules about spectrum usage, cognitive radio systems seek to underlay, overlay, or interweave the cognitive radios' signals with the transmissions of noncognitive nodes. We provide a comprehensive summary of the known capacity characterizations in terms of upper and lower bounds for each of these three approaches. The increase in system degrees of freedom obtained through cognitive radios is also illuminated. This information-theoretic survey provides guidelines for the spectral efficiency gains possible through cognitive radios, as well as practical design ideas to mitigate the coexistence challenges in today's crowded spectrum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840529/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","volume":"97","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10665026","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840529/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Breaking Spectrum Gridlock With Cognitive Radios: An Information Theoretic Perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breaking Spectrum Gridlock With Cognitive Radios: An Information Theoretic Perspective","sourcePdf":"jproc-goldsmith-2015717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170434S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4919177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1758","xplore-issue":"4919177","articleId":"4840529","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4840531,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5200771/4840531/4840531-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tingting Liu was born in Beijing, China.

For such design problems, perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and the receiver is usually required. However, in the environment of wireless communications, it is often difficult to provide sufficiently timely and accurate feedback of CSI from the receiver to the transmitter for such designs to be practically viable. In this paper, we consider the optimum design of a precoder for a wireless communication link having \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n transmitter antennas and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n receiver antennas (M < N), in which the channels are assumed to be flat fading and may be correlated. We assume that full knowledge of CSI is available at the receiver. At the transmitter, however, only the first- and second-order statistics of the channels are available. Our goal here is to come up with an efficient design of the optimal precoder for such a MIMO system by minimizing the average arithmetic mean-squared error (MSE) of zero-forcing (ZF) decision feedback detection subject to a constraint on the total transmitting power. Applying some of the properties of the matrix parameters, this nonconvex optimization problem can be transformed into a convex geometrical programming problem which can then be efficiently solved using an interior point method. The performance of the MIMO system equipped with this optimum precoder and a ZF-DFE has also been found to be comparable, and in some cases, superior to that of V-BLAST which necessitates optimally ordered successive interference cancellation based on the largest postdetection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In terms of tradeoff between performance and implementation simplicity, our new system is certainly an attractive alternative.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Precoder Design for Correlated MIMO Communication Systems Using Zero-Forcing Decision Feedback Equalization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2021638","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5200771/04840531.pdf","startPage":"3600","endPage":"3612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2021638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Precoder Design for Correlated MIMO Communication Systems Using Zero-Forcing Decision Feedback Equalization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4840531/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816672","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Precoder Design for Correlated MIMO Communication Systems Using Zero-Forcing Decision Feedback Equalization","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-jzhang-2021638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139871S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4840531","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4840532,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas F.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the propagation channel models that will be used for the design of cognitive radio systems. We start with classical models for signal loss versus distance and discuss their dependence on the physical properties of the environment and operating frequency. Here we also introduce the concept of log-normal shadowing resulting from signal blockage by man-made and natural features. Next, we discuss the time-varying nature of the wireless channel, introduced as a result of the motion of objects in the channel. This is followed by a discussion on the dispersion of the signal caused by various effects of propagation, especially in the time and frequency domains. Angular dispersion, which is discussed next, is important because cognitive radios may be based on modems that exploit the spatial domain. Lastly, we summarize channel models that have been standardized for fixed and mobile systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4840532/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665030","volume":"97","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Issues for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Issues for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"jproc-shafi-2015704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.221355S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4919177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4919177","articleId":"4840532","onlineDate":"24 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4840542,"authors":[{"name":"Yasuhiro Hamada","affiliation":["NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Hamada","id":"37269459800"},{"name":"Masahiro Tanomura","affiliation":["NEC Corporation Limited, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Tanomura","id":"37323567600"},{"name":"Masaharu Ito","affiliation":["NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaharu","lastName":"Ito","id":"37274848800"},{"name":"Kenichi Maruhashi","affiliation":["NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Maruhashi","id":"37274852300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4840542","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1047},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840542","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","High power amplifiers","Gain","Power generation","Power amplifiers","Temperature measurement","Operational amplifiers","Low voltage","Hot carrier injection","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","hot carriers","low-power electronics","millimetre wave power amplifiers","MOSFET circuits","nanoelectronics","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-gain power amplifier","CMOS technology","low-supply voltage","hot-carrier injection degradation","three-stage common-source nMOSFET","W-band CMOS amplifier","temperature compensation technique","gate bias control","frequency 77 GHz","voltage 0.7 V","size 90 nm","voltage 1.0 V","gain 20.6 dB","size 40 mum","size 80 mum","size 160 mum","gain 17.4 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOSFET power amplifiers","millimeter wave power amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"A 77 GHz 90 nm CMOS power amplifier (PA) demonstrates a gain of 17.4 dB and a saturated output power of 5.8 dBm at a low supply voltage of 0.7 V.

The next generation of surveillance systems will be able to annotate video and locally coordinate the tracking of objects while multiplexing hundreds of video streams in real-time. In this paper, we present OmniEye, a wireless distributed real-time surveillance system composed of wireless smart cameras. OmniEye is comprised of custom-designed smart camera nodes called DSPcams that communicate using an IEEE 802.11 mesh network. These cameras provide wide-area coverage and local processing with the ability to direct a sparse number of high-resolution pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ) cameras that can home onto targets of interest. Each DSPcam performs local processing to help classify events and pro-actively draw an operator's attention when necessary. In video-streaming applications, maintaining high network utilization is required in order to maximize image quality as well as the number of cameras. Our experiments show that by using the standard 802.11 DCF MAC protocol for communication, the system does not scale beyond 5-6 cameras while each camera is streaming at 1 Mbps. Also, we see high levels of jitter in video transmissions. This performance degrades further for multi-hop scenarios due to the presence of hidden nodes. In order to improve the system's scalability and reliability, we propose a Time-Synchronized Application- level MAC protocol (TSAM) capable of operating on top of existing 802.11 protocols using commodity off-the-shelf hardware. Through analysis and experimental validation, we show how TSAM is able to improve throughput and provide bounded delay. Unlike traditional CSMA-based systems, TSAM gracefully degrades in a fair manner so that existing streams can still deliver data.","doi":"10.1109/RTAS.2009.38","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4840551/4840552/04840581.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTAS.2009.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4840552","startPage":"205","endPage":"214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Video Surveillance over IEEE 802.11 Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Video Surveillance over IEEE 802.11 Mesh Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4840581/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10588868","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4840581/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Video Surveillance over IEEE 802.11 Mesh Networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3636a205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057577S","chronDate":"13-16 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4840551","isNumber":"4840552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4840551","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4840552","articleId":"4840581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4840599,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Chieh Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Chieh","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538915900"},{"name":"Zue-Der Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zue-Der","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534232100"},{"name":"Geert Carchon","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Carchon","id":"37267020700"},{"name":"Abdelkarim Mercha","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Abdelkarim","lastName":"Mercha","id":"37268833600"},{"name":"Stefaan Decoutere","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Stefaan","lastName":"Decoutere","id":"37268169000"},{"name":"Walter De Raedt","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"De Raedt","id":"37275708200"},{"name":"Chung-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Yu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4840599","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Thin film inductors","Electrostatics","Wafer scale integration","Linearity","Current supplies","Power supplies","Noise figure","Gain","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","electrostatic discharge","inductors","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","wafer level packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-noise amplifier","planar bulk-CMOS technology","high-Q above-IC inductor","electrostatic discharge-protected LNA","one-stage cascode amplifier","source inductive degeneration","thin-film wafer-level packaging technology","RF IC","voltage 1 V","frequency 23 GHz","size 45 nm","current 3.6 mA","noise figure 4 dB","gain 7.1 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection","45 nm","K -band","low-noise amplifier (LNA)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1 V 23 GHz Low-Noise Amplifier in 45 nm Planar Bulk-CMOS Technology With High-- Above-IC Inductors","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2017611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912591","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4912591/04840599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2017611","startPage":"326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4840599","abstract":"A 23 GHz electrostatic discharge-protected low-noise amplifier (LNA) has been designed and implemented by 45 nm planar bulk-CMOS technology with high-Q above-IC inductors.
