The paper presents the analysis of small antennas mounted on hand-held transceivers using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The key features of the FDTD implementation are discussed, with particular emphasis placed upon modeling of the source region. The technique is used to predict the gain patterns and broadband input impedance behavior of monopole, planar inverted F, and loop antenna elements mounted on the handset. Effects of the conducting handset chassis, the plastic casing around the device, and lumped elements integrated into the antenna design are illustrated. Experimental results are provided to verify the accuracy of the computational methodology. The concept of antenna diversity is discussed, and key assumptions and expressions are provided that characterize the multipath fading fields. Several computational examples demonstrate the diversity performance of two receiving antennas on a single handset.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.310002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7516/00310002.pdf","startPage":"1106","endPage":"1113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.310002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of antennas for hand-held transceivers using FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310002/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of antennas for hand-held transceivers using FDTD","volume":"42","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761437","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of antennas for hand-held transceivers using FDTD","sourcePdf":"00310002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072035S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"229","articleId":"310002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":310006,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

In addition, early references on this subject do not provide a rigorous discussion or derivation of the active element pattern, relying instead on a more qualitative interpretation. The purpose of this article is to make the technique of active element patterns more accessible to antenna engineers, and to provide a new derivation of the basic active element pattern relations in terms of scattering parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.310010","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00310010.png","startPage":"1176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7516/00310010.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.310010","endPage":"1178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The active element pattern","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"The active element pattern","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The active element pattern","sourcePdf":"00310010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019085S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"348","articleId":"310010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":310033,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For example, if the priority of a part depends on its class (e.g., the buffer that the part is located in), then there are no existing results on performance, or even stability. In most applications such as manufacturing systems, however, one has to choose a control or scheduling policy, i.e., a priority discipline, that optimizes a performance objective. In this paper the authors introduce a new technique for obtaining upper and lower bounds on the performance of Markovian queueing networks and scheduling policies. Assuming stability, and examining the consequence of a steady state for general quadratic forms, the authors obtain a set of linear equality constraints on the mean values of certain random variables that determine the performance of the system. Further, the conservation of time and material gives an augmenting set of linear equality and inequality constraints. Together, these allow the authors to bound the performance, either above or below, by solving a linear program. The authors illustrate this technique on several typical problems of interest in manufacturing systems. For an open re-entrant line modeling a semiconductor plant, the authors plot a bound on the mean delay (called cycle-time) as a function of line loading. It is shown that the last buffer first serve policy is almost optimal in light traffic. For another such line, it is shown that it dominates the first buffer first serve policy. For a set of open queueing networks, the authors compare their lower bounds with those obtained by another method of Ou and Wein (1992). For a closed queueing network, the authors bracket the performance of all buffer priority policies, including the suggested priority policy of Harrison and Wein (1990). The authors also study the asymptotic heavy traffic limits of the lower and upper bounds. For a manufacturing system with machine failures, it is shown how the performance changes with failure and repair rates. For systems with finite buffers, the authors show how to bound the throughput. Finally, the authors illustrate the application of their method to GI/GI/1 queues. The authors obtain analytic bounds which improve upon Kingman's bound (1970) for E/sub 2//M/1 queues.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.310033","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00310033.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7517/00310033.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.310033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance bounds for queueing networks and scheduling policies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance bounds for queueing networks and scheduling policies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310033/","volume":"39","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761392","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance bounds for queueing networks and scheduling policies","sourcePdf":"00310033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045603S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"118","articleId":"310033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":310052,"authors":[{"name":"O.L.V.

This system uses 32 current sources and 32 phase-sensitive voltmeters to make a 32-electrode system that is capable of applying arbitrary spatial patterns of current. The instrumentation provides 16 b precision on both the current values and the real and reactive voltage readings and can collect the data for a single image in 133 ms. Additionally, the instrument is able to automatically calibrate its voltmeters and current sources and adjust the current source output impedance under computer control. The major system components are discussed in detail and performance results are given. Images obtained using stationary agar targets and a moving pendulum in a phantom as well as in vivo resistivity profiles showing human respiration are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4761587","pubMedId":"7927393","displayDocTitle":"ACT3: a high-speed, high-precision electrical impedance tomograph","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACT3: a high-speed, high-precision electrical impedance tomograph","sourcePdf":"00310086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058634S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"151","articleId":"310086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":310108,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Wearout has been described in terms of trap generation inside of the oxide during high voltage stressing prior to breakdown. Breakdown occurred locally when the local density of traps exceeded a critical value and the product of the electric field and the higher leakage currents through the traps exceeded a critical energy density. The measurement techniques needed for determining the density of high-voltage stress generated traps have been described along with the method for coupling the wearout measurements to breakdown distributions. The average trap density immediately prior to breakdown was measured to be of the order of low-10/sup 19//cm/sup 3/ in 10 nm thick oxides fabricated on p-type substrates stressed with negative gate voltages. The model has been used to describe several effects observed during measurements of time-dependent-dielectric-breakdown distributions. The area dependence of breakdown distributions, the differences in the breakdown distributions during constant current and constant voltage stressing, and the multi-modal distributions often observed were simulated using the model. The model contained the provision for incorporation of weak spots in the oxide.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774275","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A model relating wearout to breakdown in thin oxides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model relating wearout to breakdown in thin oxides","sourcePdf":"00310108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115626S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"117","articleId":"310108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":310116,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Another new technique, which facilitates single-electron memory, is the ultra-thin (3.4 nm) poly-Si film used for the active region, in which sub-10-nm-width current channels and storage dots are naturally formed. In the fabricated poly-Si TFT's a single electron is stored (or \"written\") on a low-energy silicon island, and the number of stored electrons is counted (or \"read\") by the quantized threshold-voltage shift.

The authors also study object representation techniques and discuss how object representations are used for object recognition and position estimation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.310509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.310509","endPage":"1338","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00310509.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7523/00310509.pdf","startPage":"1328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On geometric hashing and the generalized Hough transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310509/","displayDocTitle":"On geometric hashing and the generalized Hough transform","volume":"24","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4767577","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On geometric hashing and the generalized Hough transform","sourcePdf":"00310509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050758S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"31","articleId":"310509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":310513,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In distributed detection structures, a number of subordinate decision makers decide upon the active hypothesis based on their own data, and then transmit these decisions to one or more primary decision makers. Then the Neyman-Pearson performance criterion is deployed, the objective is to maximize the probability of detection (also known as power probability) induced by the primary decision makers, subject to a given false alarm constraint. In this formulation, the overall optimization problem reduces to the problem of threshold evaluation. This paper deals exactly with this issue. An on-line threshold learning algorithm is proposed that operates directly an data and requires-no explicit knowledge of the underlying probability distributions. The algorithm adapts recursively the pertinent threshold parameters in a way that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between the observed and the desired output distribution. A formal convergence study is carried out and shows that, under some general conditions, the algorithm is strongly consistent; that is, the sequences of the produced threshold estimates converge to the optimal threshold values with probability 1. The rate of convergence is examined, and methods for controlling it are proposed. Simulation results are included and provide additional support to the theoretical arguments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.310534","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00310534.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7524/00310534.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.310534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"1519","endPage":"1531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line threshold learning for Neyman-Pearson distributed detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"On-line threshold learning for Neyman-Pearson distributed detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310534/","volume":"24","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761806","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line threshold learning for Neyman-Pearson distributed detection","sourcePdf":"00310534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08953S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"24","articleId":"310534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":310539,"authors":[{"name":"Zong-Ben Xu","affiliation":["Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Zong-Ben Xu","id":"37087155781"},{"name":"Yee Leung","affiliation":["Department of Geography and Center for Environmental Studies, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yee Leung","id":"37087154071"},{"name":"Xiang-Wei He","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xiang-Wei He","id":"37087198551"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"310539","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnesium compounds","Associative memory","Neural networks","Convergence","Neurons","Costs","Analytical models","Humans","Machine intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric bidirectional associative memories","heteroassociative memories","pattern orthogonality","connection complexity","logical asymmetry","storage capacity","error-correcting capability","convergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310539","abstract":"Bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is a potentially promising model for heteroassociative memories. However, its applications are severely restricted to networks with logical symmetry of interconnections and pattern orthogonality or small pattern size. Although the restrictions on pattern orthogonality and pattern size can be relaxed to a certain extent, all previous efforts are at the cost of increase in connection complexity. In this paper, a new modification of the BAM is made and a new model named asymmetric bidirectional associative memory (ABAM) is proposed. This model not only can cater for the logical asymmetry of interconnections but also is capable of accommodating a larger number of non-orthogonal patterns. Furthermore, all these properties of the ABAM are achieved without increasing the connection complexity of the network. Theoretical analysis and simulation results all demonstrate that the ABAM indeed outperforms the BAM and its existing variants in all aspects of storage capacity, error-correcting capability and convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.310539","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.310539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7524","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7524/00310539.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric bidirectional associative memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310539/","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric bidirectional associative memories","volume":"24","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4767592","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric bidirectional associative memories","sourcePdf":"00310539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032674S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"49","articleId":"310539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":310540,"authors":[{"name":"W.H.

Active control Is done by using 3-axis magneto-torquing. A preferred torque vector can not always be generated from the magnetic coils in certain regions of the orbit, due to an unfavourable direction of the geomagnetic field vector. The main objective of an acceptable control algorithm will then be to optimize the control effort: minimize the desired influence on the controlled axis and minimize the undesired disturbances to the other axes. It was found that a fuzzy controller can achieve these goals in a computationally effective way, compared to other more involved MIMO algorithms, while performing just as well or better under similar conditions. This fuzzy controller solves the control constraint problem by choosing the best magneto-torquer, the polarity and switching instances.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy control for a non-linear MIMO plant subject to control constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/21.310540","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7524/00310540.pdf","startPage":"1565","endPage":"1571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.310540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310540/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy control for a non-linear MIMO plant subject to control constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4767593","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy control for a non-linear MIMO plant subject to control constraints","sourcePdf":"00310540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036669S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"16","articleId":"310540","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":310559,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to acquire some of these characteristics, special provisions need to be made during circuit layout and design, resulting in high-density packages. The designed circuits have a large number of interconnects which are printed on electrically small surface areas and communicate through the substrate in a direct through-via fashion or electromagnetically through appropriately etched apertures. In a circuit environment of this complexity, parasitic effects such as radiation and cross talk are intensified, thus, making the vertical interconnection problem very critical. In this paper, transitions using through-substrate vias are considered and analyzed both in the time and frequency domains using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) technique and the Finite Element Method (FEM), respectively. The merits of each method in conjunction with accuracy, computational efficiency and versatility are discussed and results are compared showing excellent agreement. Specifically, a microstrip short-circuit, a microstrip ground pad, a CPW-to-microstrip through-via transition and a channelized CPW-to-microstrip transition are analyzed and their electrical performance is studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.310581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7525/00310581.pdf","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.310581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of high frequency interconnects using finite difference time domain and finite element methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310581/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of high frequency interconnects using finite difference time domain and finite element methods","volume":"42","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4780859","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of high frequency interconnects using finite difference time domain and finite element methods","sourcePdf":"00310581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071793S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"78","articleId":"310581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310584,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is not only well-suited for handling the complex geometries involved, but is also useful for generating the desired frequency response with a single simulation. In this paper, we describe several techniques for improving the computational efficiency of the conventional FDTD algorithm as applied to the problem of modeling complex power plane geometries. We also show how the time domain response can be processed to extract equivalent circuits that are valid in the high frequency regimes up to several GHz, and are suitable for use in circuit simulators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00310589.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7525/00310589.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.310589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.310589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient modeling of power planes in computer packages using the finite difference time domain method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Electronics packaging","Time domain analysis","Solid modeling","Circuit simulation","Integrated circuit interconnections","Geometry","Frequency response","Computational modeling","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","packaging","modelling","frequency response","equivalent circuits","circuit analysis computing","digital computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modeling","power plane geometries","computer packages","finite difference time domain method","electronic packaging","frequency response","computational efficiency","FDTD algorithm","time domain response","equivalent circuits","high frequency regimes","circuit simulators","HF effects","interconnect densities","high speed devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Efficient modeling of power planes in computer packages using the finite difference time domain method","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4780867","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient modeling of power planes in computer packages using the finite difference time domain method","sourcePdf":"00310589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060676S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"35","articleId":"310589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310590,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Linear suppressed-carrier modulation is assumed. The work here aims at laying a conceptual foundation for optimum symbol-by-symbol detection, and rectifies existing approaches to the problem. The optimum receiver structure is obtained explicitly for an arbitrary carrier phase model, but its computational requirements are too heavy in general for any practical implementation. In one important special case, namely, the case in which the carrier phase can be treated as a constant over some K+1 symbol intervals, the optimum receiver can be approximated by a readily implementable decision-feedback structure at high SNR. Simulated error performance results are presented for this latter receiver for PSK modulations, with various carrier phase models. Since a decision-feedback receiver can encounter a \"runaway\", a variation of this receiver is developed which uses feedforward of tentative decisions concerning future symbols. This modified receiver does not have any \"runaway\" problem, and has been shown to yield good error performance via simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.310614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.310614","startPage":"2543","endPage":"2552","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7526/00310614.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum symbol-by-symbol detection of uncoded digital data over the Gaussian channel with unknown carrier phase","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimum symbol-by-symbol detection of uncoded digital data over the Gaussian channel with unknown carrier phase","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4774754","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310614/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum symbol-by-symbol detection of uncoded digital data over the Gaussian channel with unknown carrier phase","sourcePdf":"00310614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034068S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","articleId":"310614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":310615,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

In WDM stars the fundamental problem of receiver conflicts leads to severe performance degradation. In current solutions conflicts are prevented by scheduling transmissions or resolved by retransmissions. Both approaches waste bandwidth and involve electronic processing and buffering. The proposed approach is conceptually different in introducing a local conflict resolution mechanism at each receiver incorporating delay lines. This solution brings optical star networks a step closer to an all-optical realization. In addition, it allows an almost total utilization of the channels, as obtainable until now only by TDM control. Contrary to TDM, however, the proposed solution does not suffer performance degradation under heterogeneous traffic conditions and increasing number of nodes. It is thus unique in offering the potential of an all-optical solution providing at the same time high throughput, low delay, small buffer requirements, and robustness under all traffic conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7526/00310618.pdf","startPage":"2582","endPage":"2591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.310618","doi":"10.1109/26.310618","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00310618.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadro-Star: a high performance optical WDM star network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Quadro-Star: a high performance optical WDM star network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310618/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774758","volume":"42","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadro-Star: a high performance optical WDM star network","sourcePdf":"00310618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037631S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","articleId":"310618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310619,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

In a recently proposed optical orthogonal code division multiple-access (OOCDMA) system, one bit of user's data is transmitted per sequence-period, and a threshold is employed for the final bit decision. In this paper, a system that can transmit multibits per sequence-period is introduced, and avalanche photodiode (APD) noise, thermal noise, and interference, are included. This system, derived by exploiting orthogonal properties of the OOCDMA code sequence and using a maximum search (instead of a threshold) in the final decision, is log/sub 2/ F times higher in throughput, where F is sequence-period. For example, four orders of magnitude are better in bit error probability at -56 dBW received laser power, with F=1000 chips, 10 \"marks\" in a sequence, and 10 users of 30 Mb/s data rate for one-bit/sequence-period and 270 Mb/s data rate for multibits/sequence-period system. Furthermore, an exact analysis is performed for the log/sub 2/F bits/sequence-period system with a hard-limiter placed before the receiver, and its performance is compared to the performance without hard-limiter, for the chip-synchronous case. The improvement from using a hard-limiter is significant in the log/sub 2/F bits/sequence-period OCCDMA system (while it is not in a one-bit/sequence-period OOCDMA system proposed in Part I).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Optical noise","Optical receivers","Error probability","Throughput","Interference","Avalanche photodiodes","Power lasers","Performance analysis","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical links","optical fibres","code division multiple access","semiconductor device noise","avalanche photodiodes","thermal noise","light interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal code-division multiple-access","avalanche photodiode noise","optical system","multibits/sequence-period OOCDMA","thermal noise","interference","code sequence","maximum search","throughput","bit error probability","received laser power","data rate","exact analysis","hard-limiter","receiver","270 Mbit/s","30 Mbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310619","doi":"10.1109/26.310619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7526/00310619.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.310619","startPage":"2592","endPage":"2599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical orthogonal code-division multiple-access system .II.

Proposed constructions are based on the mappings from integer sequences into binary sequences. The authors use the concept of number theoretic quadratic congruences and a subset of Reed-Solomon codes similar to the one utilized in the Welch-Costas frequency-hop (FH) patterns. The properties of the codes are as good as or better than the properties of existing codes for synchronous CDMA communications: both the number of code-sequences within a single code family and the number of code families with good properties are significantly increased when compared to the known code designs. Possible applications are presented. To evaluate the performance of the proposed codes, a new class of hit arrays called cyclical hit arrays is recalled, which give insight into the previously unknown properties of the few classes of number theoretic FH patterns. Cyclical hit arrays and the proposed mappings are used to determine the exact probability distribution functions of random variables that represent interference between users of a time-hopping or optical CDMA system. Expressions for the bit error probability in multi-user CDMA systems are derived as a function of the number of simultaneous CDMA system users, the length of signature sequences and the threshold of a matched filter detector. The performance results are compared with the results for some previously known codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.310621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7526/00310621.pdf","startPage":"2608","endPage":"2617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.310621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design and performance analysis for several new classes of codes for optical synchronous CDMA and for arbitrary-medium time-hopping synchronous CDMA communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"The design and performance analysis for several new classes of codes for optical synchronous CDMA and for arbitrary-medium time-hopping synchronous CDMA communication systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4774761","volume":"42","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design and performance analysis for several new classes of codes for optical synchronous CDMA and for arbitrary-medium time-hopping synchronous CDMA communication systems","sourcePdf":"00310621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044954S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","articleId":"310621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310636,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

The thermal barrier potential was determined directly by the simultaneous measurements of the on-axis space potentials at both of these locations. Two-dimensional space potentials were obtained by adjusting the energy of the probing beams so that measurements were made along different chords through the plasma cross-section. A newly developed diagnostic device, a cylindrical End-Loss Energy Component Analyzer (ELECA), was also used to measure the plug potential, and was suitable for determining the distribution functions of end-loss ions. This diagnostic can also be useful as a compact energy analyzer for a beam probe diagnostic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/27.310638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.310638","endPage":"340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/7527/00310638.pdf","startPage":"332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a gold neutral beam probe and an end-loss energy component analyzer to space potential measurements in a tandem mirror","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310638/","displayDocTitle":"Application of a gold neutral beam probe and an end-loss energy component analyzer to space potential measurements in a tandem mirror","volume":"22","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4786901","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a gold neutral beam probe and an end-loss energy component analyzer to space potential measurements in a tandem mirror","sourcePdf":"00310638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035184S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"2","articleId":"310638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":310641,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The window size must be large enough to include enough intensity variation for reliable matching, but small enough to avoid the effects of projective distortion. If the window is too small and does not cover enough intensity variation, it gives a poor disparity estimate, because the signal (intensity variation) to noise ratio is low. If, on the other hand, the window is too large and covers a region in which the depth of scene points (i.e., disparity) varies, then the position of maximum correlation or minimum SSD may not represent correct matching due to different projective distortions in the left and right images. For this reason, a window size must be selected adaptively depending on local variations of intensity and disparity. The authors present a method to select an appropriate window by evaluating the local variation of the intensity and the disparity. The authors employ a statistical model of the disparity distribution within the window. This modeling enables the authors to assess how disparity variation, as well as intensity variation, within a window affects the uncertainty of disparity estimate at the center point of the window. As a result, the authors devise a method which searches for a window that produces the estimate of disparity with the least uncertainty for each pixel of an image: the method controls not only the size but also the shape (rectangle) of the window. The authors have embedded this adaptive-window method in an iterative stereo matching algorithm: starting with an initial estimate of the disparity map, the algorithm iteratively updates the disparity estimate for each point by choosing the size and shape of a window till it converges. The stereo matching algorithm has been tested on both synthetic and real images, and the quality of the disparity maps obtained demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive window method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7529/00310690.pdf","startPage":"920","endPage":"932","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.310690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.310690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stereo matching algorithm with an adaptive window: theory and experiment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Uncertainty","Shape control","Signal to noise ratio","Layout","Pixel","Size control","Iterative methods","Image converters","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo image processing","image sequences","iterative methods","correlation methods","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo matching algorithm","adaptive window","window size","intensity variation","reliable matching","projective distortion","disparity estimate","maximum correlation","sum of squared differences","statistical model","disparity distribution","disparity variation","uncertainty","iterative stereo matching algorithm","disparity map","synthetic images","real images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"A stereo matching algorithm with an adaptive window: theory and experiment","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774805","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stereo matching algorithm with an adaptive window: theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"00310690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036724S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"462","articleId":"310690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":310691,"authors":[{"name":"M.

They are iterative procedures that aim at reducing local ambiguities and achieving global consistency through a parallel exploitation of contextual information, which is quantitatively expressed in terms of a set of \"compatibility coefficients.\" The problem of determining compatibility coefficients has received a considerable attention in the past and many heuristic, statistical-based methods have been suggested. In this paper, the authors propose a rather different viewpoint to solve this problem: they derive them attempting to optimize the performance of the relaxation algorithm over a sample of training data; no statistical interpretation is given: compatibility coefficients are simply interpreted as real numbers, for which performance is optimal. Experimental results over a novel application of relaxation are given, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7529/00310691.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.310691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.310691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning compatibility coefficients for relaxation labeling processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Labeling","Pattern recognition","Artificial intelligence","Parallel architectures","Learning","Image processing","Iterative methods","Training data","Artificial neural networks","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relaxation theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear programming","numerical analysis","probability","neural nets","iterative methods","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compatibility coefficients","relaxation labeling processes","image processing","pattern recognition","artificial intelligence","iterative procedures","local ambiguities","global consistency","contextual information","training data","real numbers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Learning compatibility coefficients for relaxation labeling processes","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774806","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning compatibility coefficients for relaxation labeling processes","sourcePdf":"00310691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073763S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"38","articleId":"310691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":310721,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

However, there are more reasons than mere prettiness to store pixels this way. One of the most important anti-aliening tools in computer graphics comes from a generalization of the simple act of storing a pixel into a frame buffer. Several people simultaneously discovered the usefulness of this operation, so it goes by several names: matting, image compositing, alpha blending, overlaying, or lerping. It was most completely codified in a previous paper by Porter and Duff (1984), where they call it the over operator.

Binary skeleton images are registered using an elastic registration algorithm in order to estimate the motion of the corresponding arteries. This algorithm operates recursively on the skeleton images by considering an autoregressive (AR) model of the deformation in conjunction with a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The AR model is used at the pixel level and provides a suitable cost function to DP through the innovation process. In addition, a moving average (MA) model for the motion of the entire skeleton is used in combination with the local AR model for improved registration results. The performance of this motion estimation method is demonstrated on simulated and real digital angiographic image sequences. It is shown that motion estimation using elastic registration of skeletons is very successful especially with low contrast and noisy angiographic images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.310876","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"450","endPage":"460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/7533/00310876.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.310876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion estimation of skeletonized angiographic images using elastic registration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Skeleton","Image sequences","Arteries","Deformable models","Dynamic programming","Heart","Cost function","Student members","Recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","biomechanics","cardiology","diagnostic radiography","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skeletonized angiographic images","motion estimation","elastic registration","arterial motion","dynamic programming algorithm","low contrast images","noisy images","medical diagnostic images","cost function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Motion estimation of skeletonized angiographic images using elastic registration","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4766651","pubMedId":"18218520","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310876/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion estimation of skeletonized angiographic images using elastic registration","sourcePdf":"00310876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043568S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"33","articleId":"310876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":310878,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A comparison with the JPEG standard reveals that the entropy-coded DPCM method can provide about 7 to 8 dB higher SNR for the same compression performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/7533/00310885.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-lossless compression of medical images through entropy-coded DPCM","doi":"10.1109/42.310885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.310885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Near-lossless compression of medical images through entropy-coded DPCM","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4766660","pubMedId":"18218529","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-lossless compression of medical images through entropy-coded DPCM","sourcePdf":"00310885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034236S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"123","articleId":"310885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310897,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The output is a high-level interconnection description of mixed analog/digital building block circuits that is generated by searching a multidimensional design space to satisfy the throughput requirements and minimize an area-time cost function. A combination of quantitative analysis and behavioral modeling techniques tackles the problems of hardware nonidealities by screening suitable analog circuits. Digital hardware is employed when no analog circuit is found that satisfies the performance requirements of any operation. A heuristic partitioning scheme reduces the interfaces between blocks of circuits operating in analog and digital modes. The parallelism in ANN systems is, handled by a new scheduling and allocating procedure that selectively sequentializes groups of operations with the goal of iteratively improving an area-time cost function. The synthesizer is also capable of embedding hardware units that are intended to operate asynchronously. The synthesis methodology is illustrated with two design examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.310897","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1087","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7534/00310897.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.310897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed analog/digital hardware synthesis of artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Network synthesis","Cost function","Analog circuits","Circuit synthesis","Neural network hardware","Flow graphs","Integrated circuit interconnections","Multidimensional systems","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","neural chips","VLSI","circuit CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed analog/digital hardware","hardware synthesis","artificial neural networks","data flow graph","high-level interconnection description","multidimensional design space","throughput requirements","area-time cost function","quantitative analysis","behavioral modeling techniques","hardware nonidealities","heuristic partitioning scheme","ANN systems","scheduling","allocating procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Mixed analog/digital hardware synthesis of artificial neural networks","volume":"13","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4779964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed analog/digital hardware synthesis of artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00310897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049975S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","articleId":"310897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310898,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

Iterative approaches and spectral approaches to two-way ratio-cut partitioning have yielded higher quality partitioning results. In this paper, we develop a spectral approach to multi-way ratio-cut partitioning that provides a generalization of the ratio-cut cost metric to L-way partitioning and a lower bound on this cost metric. Our approach involves finding the k smallest eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of the Laplacian of the graph. The eigenvectors provide an embedding of the graph's n vertices into a k-dimensional subspace. We devise a time and space efficient clustering heuristic to coerce the points in the embedding into k partitions.

Previously, we showed that a good measure of power dissipation and reliability is the extent of circuit switching activity, called the transition density (see ibid., vol. 12, no. 2, p. 310-23, 1993). However, the algorithm for computing the density in the afore-mentioned paper is very basic and does not take into account the effect of inertial delays of logic gates. Thus, as we will show in this paper, the transition density may be severely overestimated in high-frequency applications. To overcome this problem, we model the effect of gate delay on logic signals in the form of a conceptual low-pass filter module that does not allow unacceptably short logic pulses to propagate. Using a stochastic model of logic signals, we then derive the equations required to propagate the transition density through the filter. We will present experimental results that illustrate the validity and importance of these results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.310901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7534/00310901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.310901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7534","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-pass filter for computing the transition density in digital circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-pass filter for computing the transition density in digital circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4779968","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-pass filter for computing the transition density in digital circuits","sourcePdf":"00310901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028665S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","articleId":"310901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310903,"authors":[{"name":"W.

By recursively calling certain learning functions, it is possible to extract all logic dependencies between signals in a circuit and to perform precise implications for a given set of value assignments. This is of fundamental importance because it represents a new solution to the Boolean satisfiability problem. Thus, what we present is a new and uniform conceptual framework for a wide range of CAD problems including, but not limited to, test pattern generation, design verification, as well as logic optimization problems. Previous test generators for combinational and sequential circuits use a decision tree to systematically explore the search space when trying to generate a test vector. Recursive learning represents an attractive alternative. Using recursive learning with sufficient depth of recursion during the test generation process guarantees that implications are performed precisely; i.e., all necessary assignments for fault detection are identified at every stage of the algorithm so that no backtracks can occur. Consequently, no decision tree is needed to guarantee the completeness of the test generation algorithm. Recursive learning is not restricted to a particular logic alphabet and can be combined with most test generators for combinational and sequential circuits. Experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of recursive learning are compared with the conventional branch-and-bound technique for test generation in combinational circuits. In particular, redundancy identification by recursive learning is demonstrated to be much more efficient than by previously reported techniques. In an important recent development, recursive learning has been shown to provide significant progress in design verification problems. Also importantly, recursive learning-based techniques have already been shown to be useful for logic optimization. Specifically, techniques based on recursive learning have already yielded better optimized circuits than the well known MIS-II.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/310903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4779970","volume":"13","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Recursive learning: a new implication technique for efficient solutions to CAD problems-test, verification, and optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive learning: a new implication technique for efficient solutions to CAD problems-test, verification, and optimization","sourcePdf":"00310903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069084S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"146","articleId":"310903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":310904,"authors":[{"name":"Tai-Yu Chou","affiliation":["Advanced Package Development Group, LSI Logic Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tai-Yu Chou","id":"37358213800"},{"name":"Z.J.

Most of the neural network research to date has been done with a view to accelerate learning speed. In the medical context, however, generalisation may be more important than learning speed. With the brain stem auditory evoked potential classification task described in this study, the authors found that parameter values that gave fastest learning could result in poor generalisation. In order to achieve maximum generalisation, it was necessary to fine tune the neural net for gain, momentum, batch size, and hidden layer size. Although this maximization could be time consuming, especially with larger training sets, the authors' results suggest that fine tuning parameters can have important clinical consequences, which justifies the time involved. In the authors' case, fine tuning parameters for high generalisation had the additional effect of reducing false negative classifications, with only a small sacrifice in learning speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00310986.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/7537/00310986.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/51.310986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.310986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=310986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining hearing threshold from brain stem evoked potentials.

In the case of a distance relay protecting a phase of a double-circuit line, the state of the parallel circuit is of major importance. Simulations show that, depending on the power system state, a distance relay can cover from less than 50% up to far more than 100% of the total line length. This is demonstrated with a double-circuit line under the single-line-to-ground fault (SLG) fault condition, since this is the most common type of fault. In this paper the distance protection of a double-circuit line under the SLG fault condition is formulated. To achieve correct operation, the relay does not only use the measured quantities of the circuit-to-be-protected, but also the zero sequence current of the parallel circuit. Such a relay requires extra measuring equipment, and, moreover, the zero sequence current of the parallel circuit cannot always be measured. Therefore, another approach is chosen. A correction factor is introduced, set adaptively according to the actual power system state. In this way, the appropriate setting of the relay is provided, in relation with the actual power system state. A side-effect of the adaptive setting of the relay is that the safety margin in the relay settings is decreased, due to the uncertainty in the power system state. By adapting the relay to the actual power system state, maximum selectivity is achieved, and the protection system as such will be more reliable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.311155","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7540/00311155.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1297","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.311155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive distance protection of a double-circuit line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive distance protection of a double-circuit line","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4757140","publicationDate":"July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive distance protection of a double-circuit line","sourcePdf":"00311155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032377S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"87","articleId":"311155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":311162,"authors":[{"name":"V.V.

The main components of this equipment are a high-speed vacuum switch and a GTO switch connected in parallel. The usual load current is carried by the vacuum switch.

According to the typical daily load patterns and the energy consumption of customers, the hourly loading of distribution transformers can be solved. A three-phase load flow program is applied to calculate the feeder power flow so that the hourly feeder loading will be the same as that obtained by the field test. The hourly primary conductor loss, secondary conductor loss, transformer copper loss and core loss are then solved according to the mathematical modeling of system components. The sensitivity analysis of system loss with respect to the feeder loading, power factor, feeder length, transformer capacity is then performed to derive the simplified loss model of distribution feeders. A distribution feeder of Taipower system is then selected for computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. By applying the simplified loss model derived, the daily loss pattern of distribution feeders is solved according to the actual hourly feeder loading. It is concluded that the proposed methodology provides a useful tool for distribution engineers to estimate the operation efficiency of distribution systems in a very effective manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.311212","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7540/00311212.pdf","startPage":"1545","endPage":"1551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.311212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of simplified loss models for distribution system analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Development of simplified loss models for distribution system analysis","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4752954","publicationDate":"July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of simplified loss models for distribution system analysis","sourcePdf":"00311212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037293S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"42","articleId":"311212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":311215,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Comparisons between the responses obtained with the NN and PI controllers for the rectifier of an HVDC transmission system are made under typical system perturbations and faults.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.311262","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/7542/00311262.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"296","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.311262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative evaluation of neural-network-based and PI current controllers for HVDC transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparative evaluation of neural-network-based and PI current controllers for HVDC transmission","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4757167","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative evaluation of neural-network-based and PI current controllers for HVDC transmission","sourcePdf":"00311262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042421S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"20","articleId":"311262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":311263,"authors":[{"name":"S.-A.

The losses analyzed are the switching, conduction, and gate drive losses. A 300 W, 13.56 MHz, Class-D circuit is designed in the traditional manner to illustrate the magnitude of the different types of loss. A circuit using the ZVS equations developed in this paper is designed. An experimental circuit is built using standard IRF540 devices in TO220 packages. That circuit does not meet its performance goals because of the package inductance. A new low inductance half-bridge package is introduced to solve this problem. Techniques for circuit layout and power measurements for RF applications are also presented in the experimental section. A low loss gate drive circuit is also presented using a Class-E circuit to provide the drive power.

The depositions are shown to be electrochemical in nature in that an oxidation reduction reaction results in metal ions in solution depositing on the wafer as elements with an oxidation state of 0. The theory is only qualitative in that it can only predict which metals will deposit, not how much. Experimentally, simple transmission equations can be determined which relate metallic contamination levels on Si wafer surfaces (atoms/cm/sup 2/) to metal concentration in the solution (ppb). Simple test structures have been fabricated with known amounts of iron and copper contamination in the pregate oxide clean of a 1.25 /spl mu/m CMOS process. Device measurements indicate device degradation in the case of copper, confirming deposition studies that copper deposits from HF solutions. Iron contaminated wafers show no contamination related device effects, in support of theoretical predictions and deposition studies indicating iron does not deposit from HF solutions. The importance and potential usefulness of test structures as homogeneous contamination monitors is illustrated through device modeling of the contamination effects observed in the test structures that can then be used to estimate the effects of such contamination on ULSI circuit performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311326/","volume":"7","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4775851","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying the impact of homogeneous metal contamination using test structure metrology and device modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying the impact of homogeneous metal contamination using test structure metrology and device modeling","sourcePdf":"00311326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042347S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"15","articleId":"311326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":311333,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.

The fabrication line description in conjunction with the MOSFET model was used to develop a manufacturing application, specifically, a performance prediction model which uses the process parameters as measured on the manufacturing floor to predict the performance of fabricated integrated circuits before packaging and final test. The MOSFET model and the performance prediction model are integrated, and data taken from the manufacturing line can be used to verify the models, to identify process shifts, and suggest design improvements for further manufacturability enhancements.

However, the fundamental plasma chemistry and physics in plasma etching reactors are not easy to model. Reliable empirical models for such a process are desirable for investigating the process behavior and realizing real-time control. One of the main difficulties encountered in this endeavour is that frequently very limited experimental data are available for model development for any particular apparatus. In the present work, a special artificial neural network (ANN) method is presented which shows how to develop satisfactory models even though fewer experimental data exist than there are coefficients in the ANN models. The method aims at constructing a model which can satisfy the criteria of minimum training error, maximum smoothness, and simplest network structure. Two ANN models were developed for a plasma etching reactor using CF/sub 4//O/sub 2/ or CF/sub 4//H/sub 2/ as a reactant that relate the manipulated and controlled variables or the manipulated and performance variables, respectively. Comparison of the predictions made by the ANN's with those made by the second order regression models that were used as the basis of the experimental design to get the data indicated that the ANN's predicted the process behavior more reasonably than the classical regression models when the process is operated at various operating conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.311337","startPage":"333","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.311337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/7544/00311337.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing a reliable neural network model for a plasma etching process using limited experimental data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311337/","displayDocTitle":"Constructing a reliable neural network model for a plasma etching process using limited experimental data","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4775862","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing a reliable neural network model for a plasma etching process using limited experimental data","sourcePdf":"00311337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147932S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"53","articleId":"311337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":311341,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.H.

Such plants feature a characteristic reentrant process flow, where lots repeatedly return at different stages of their production to the same service stations for further processing, consequently creating much competition for machines. We introduce a new class of scheduling policies, called Fluctuation Smoothing policies. Unanimously, our policies achieved the best mean cycle time and Standard Deviation of Cycle Time, in all the configurations of plant models and release policies tested. As an example, under the recommended Workload Regulation Release policy, for a heavily loaded Research and Development Fabrication Line model, our Fluctuation Smoothing policies achieved a reduction of 22.4% in the Mean Queueing Time, and a reduction of 52.0% in the Standard Deviation of Cycle Time, over the baseline FIFO policy. These conclusions are based on extensive simulations conducted on two models of semiconductor manufacturing plants. The first is a model of a Research and Development Fabrication Line. The second is an aggregate model intended to approximate a full scale production line. Statistical tests are used to corroborate our conclusions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.311341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.311341","endPage":"388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/7544/00311341.pdf","startPage":"374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient scheduling policies to reduce mean and variance of cycle-time in semiconductor manufacturing plants","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311341/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient scheduling policies to reduce mean and variance of cycle-time in semiconductor manufacturing plants","volume":"7","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4775866","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient scheduling policies to reduce mean and variance of cycle-time in semiconductor manufacturing plants","sourcePdf":"00311341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055642S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"294","articleId":"311341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":311457,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

This approach, which he calls the \"perfectly matched layer (PML) for the absorption of electromagnetic waves\", creates a nonphysical absorber adjacent to the outer grid boundary that has a wave impedance independent of the angle of incidence and frequency of outgoing scattered waves. This paper verifies Berenger's strong claims for PML for 2-D FD-TD grids and extends and verifies PML for 3-D FD-TD grids. Indeed, PML is >40 db more accurate than second-order Mur (1981), and PML works just as well in 3-D as it does in 2-D. It should have a major impact upon the entire FD-TD modeling community, leading to new possibilities for high-accuracy simulations especially for low-observable aerospace targets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.311494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/7550/00311494.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.311494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation and extension to three dimensions of the Berenger PML absorbing boundary condition for FD-TD meshes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=311494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311494/","displayDocTitle":"Validation and extension to three dimensions of the Berenger PML absorbing boundary condition for FD-TD meshes","volume":"4","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4782821","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation and extension to three dimensions of the Berenger PML absorbing boundary condition for FD-TD meshes","sourcePdf":"00311494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04287S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"299","articleId":"311494","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":311497,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These systems contain a single nonlinear element (a quantizer) embedded in an otherwise linear system, and can exhibit such nonlinear behavior as limit cycles, subharmonics, phase-locking and chaos. Due to the discrete spectra that result when limit cycles are present, human listeners perceive objectionable tones in the quantization noise. This problem can be overcome by using dither or, as this paper suggests, by making the modulator chaotic.

We present two methods for determining the coefficients of the McClellan transform when designing 2-D linear-phase FIR digital filters with continuous and powers-of-two coefficients, respectively. Based on the proposed methods, the contour approximation for 1-D (one-dimensional) to 2-D digital filter transformation and finding the band-edge frequencies of the corresponding 1-D FIR digital filter can be achieved simultaneously. This results in that the required complexity of the designed 2-D digital filter satisfying the design specifications can be minimized. Moreover, the proposed methods allow us to employ the McClellan transform with order more than one for enhancing the capability of the original McClellan transform. Considering the determination of the McClellan transform coefficients and the band-edge frequencies for the design, we formulate the design problem as a linear programming optimization problem.

A particular challenge is to determine if such a metacomputer can produce superlinear speedup despite latency and communication overheads. One of the applications in the CASA testbed is a model we developed that couples a global atmosphere model to a world ocean model. Simulations using such coupled general circulation models for climate studies demand considerable computer resources. When distributing such a model, we need to consider the methods for masking latency with computation, the communications bandwidth requirements for different decomposition strategies, the optimal computer architecture for each major phase of the computation, and the effects of latency and communication costs for different decomposition strategies. Here we focus an the last two issues, and demonstrate that choosing the appropriate computer architectures and masking communication with computation can produce superlinear speedup.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/88.311573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Parallel & Distributed Technology: Systems & Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Parallel & Distributed Technology: Systems & Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/88/7554/00311573.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/88.311573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving superlinear speedup on a heterogeneous, distributed system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  1994","displayDocTitle":"Achieving superlinear speedup on a heterogeneous, distributed system","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 1994","accessionNumber":"4777298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving superlinear speedup on a heterogeneous, distributed system","sourcePdf":"00311573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065544S","chronDate":"Summer  1994","isNumber":"7554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"88","citationCount":"16","articleId":"311573","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":311634,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

The proposed classifier is both time and space efficient, when compared with already existing NN classifiers, since it does not require complex distance calculations and ordering of distances, and storage requirements are kept minimal since each cell stores information only about its nearest neighborhood. The proposed classifier produces piece-wise linear discriminant curves between clusters of points of complex shape (nonlinearly separable) using the computational geometry concept known as the Voronoi diagram, which is established through CA evolution. These curves are established during an \"off-line\" operation and, thus, the subsequent classification of unknown patterns is achieved very fast.

If the implementation is found not to be functionally equivalent to the specification, it is important to correct the implementation automatically. This paper describes a formal method for the diagnosis and correction of logic design errors in an incorrect gate-level implementation. We use Boolean equation techniques to search for potential error locations. An efficient search and pruning algorithm is developed by introducing the notion of immediate dominator set. Two correction procedures are proposed. Gate correction corrects errors such as wrong gate type, missing inverters, etc.; line correction corrects errors such as missing wires and wrong connections. Our method is robust and covers all, simple design errors described by Abadir et al. (1988). Experimental results for a set of ISCAS and MCNC benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.311641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/7556/00311641.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.311641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=311641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic design error diagnosis and correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311641/","displayDocTitle":"Logic design error diagnosis and correction","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4770568","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic design error diagnosis and correction","sourcePdf":"00311641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037737S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"26","articleId":"311641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":311645,"authors":[{"name":"K.

An effective way of improving the speed of a circuit is by transistor sizing which unfortunately increases power dissipation to a large extent. It is shown that by sizing transistors judiciously it is possible to gain significant speed improvements at the cost of only a slight increase in power and hence a better power-delay product. Perflex, an in-house performance driven layout generator, is used to systematically generate sized layouts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.311649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/7556/00311649.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.311649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-delay characteristics of CMOS adders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Power-delay characteristics of CMOS adders","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4770577","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-delay characteristics of CMOS adders","sourcePdf":"00311649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04004S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"38","articleId":"311649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":311653,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

Demands placed upon component manufacturers are equally suitable to the consumer market. The most stringent military test to pass is the component's durability to withstand high temperatures concomitant with high humidities. Before designing a conformal coating for capacitors and resisters, a number of thin films were cast, cured and tested at 85/spl deg/C, 95% RH. The films were heat-cured silicones, epoxies, and ethoxy monomers, and UV-cured acrylated silicones, epoxies, and monomers. Acrylated polymers are free radical curing mechanisms. In this instance, free radicals were generated using UV light. The curing took place in seconds. Vapor transmission across a thin barrier film of these materials was measured to determine the film's integrity in withstanding simultaneously high temperatures and humidities. A number of correlations were discovered in regard to the chemistry needed to enhance a film's resistance to environmental conditions. There are a number of chemical reactions that take place within the film's structure when exposed to water. However, in the absence of chemical reactions, a film's integrity is related to its crosslink density and steric hinderance. The author investigated a number of heat-cured and UV-cured chemistries. In correlating vapor transmission data with a components electrical properties, solid tantalum capacitors were coated with ethoxylated epoxy and acrylated epoxy. Vapor transmission data strongly agreed with the electrical properties of a capacitor when subjected to 85/spl deg/C, 95% RH. Surprisingly the electrical properties were better for the high crosslinked, steric, acrylated epoxy. Rapid cure played a major role in the film's integrity to crosslink uniformly without gas egression or pinholes. The electrical values were consistent with the vapor transmission data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/95.311738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/7559/00311738.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.311738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UV curable coatings for electronic components","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"UV curable coatings for electronic components","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4773069","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UV curable coatings for electronic components","sourcePdf":"00311738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039861S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"4","articleId":"311738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":311746,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

The chip employs dual redundancy, CMOS drive electronics with minimum gate lengths of 0.8 microns, two metal layers, and a 5-V /spl plusmn/10% power supply. The layout has an area of 0.9 cm sq, and approximately 50% of the chip area is devoted to the memory cell array. The memory chip is designed around 1.4 /spl mu/m/spl times/6.1 /spl mu/m, 80-/spl Omega/ elements using GMR material; the elements are spaced 1.4 /spl mu/m apart. The material is composed of two 50-/spl Aring/ ternary alloy layers separated by 30 /spl Aring/ of copper and has a nominal M-R coefficient of 6.0%. Minimum read signal is /spl plusmn/2.5 mV; sense current is 2.5 mA; work current is /spl plusmn/30 mA; and input and output is 4b wide. The memory employs a new read scheme in which two-phase sensing is employed. The scheme provides a sensitive, stable output and diminishes the array area by a factor of two, at the expense of read access time. The design contains over 700000 transistors and over 2 million memory cells; a prototype 64 K section of this design has been built, but the full design has yet to be constructed on silicon. The design demonstrates that with GMR memory cells, M-R memories can be designed with densities and speeds comparable to dynamic RAM's.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/95.311746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/7559/00311746.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.311746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7559","startPage":"373","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1-Mb memory chip using giant magnetoresistive memory cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=311746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"1-Mb memory chip using giant magnetoresistive memory cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4773077","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1-Mb memory chip using giant magnetoresistive memory cells","sourcePdf":"00311746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04504S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"17","articleId":"311746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":311747,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The device is referred to as the High Injection MOS (or HIMOS) cell and is fabricated in a 0.7-/spl mu/m double polysilicon CMOS technology with minor additions to the standard CMOS process flow. The cell has been optimized for a virtual ground array configuration in order to shrink the area down to the range of 10-20 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ per bit. An extensive study is presented of the influence of applied programming voltages and device geometry on cell performance. It is shown that, for a cell area of 16.5 /spl mu/m/sup 2/, microsecond programming can be achieved with a program-gate voltage of 12 V and 5 V-only operation. Furthermore, during programming the unique features of the HIMOS cell result in very low drain current (approximately 25 /spl mu/A per cell for 5 V-only operation) and a correspondingly low power consumption. It is shown experimentally that the combination of high programming efficiency with low power consumption indicates that 3.3 V-only operation is already viable in 0.7-/spl mu/m technology. In addition, a detailed study of the various possible disturb effects confirms the reliability of the HIMOS technology, and the feasibility of using a virtual ground array for this memory cell.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4773078","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A 5 V-compatible flash EEPROM cell with microsecond programming time for embedded memory applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5 V-compatible flash EEPROM cell with microsecond programming time for embedded memory applications","sourcePdf":"00311747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055554S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"14","articleId":"311747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":311748,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

This technology, called SONGS (polysilicon-blocking oxide-silicon nitride-tunnel oxide-silicon), has demonstrated remarkable scalability in programming voltage. To determine our scaling guidelines, we have developed an analytical model for the transient characteristics that examines the influence of the dielectric composition and programming voltage on programming speed.

In particular, efforts are made to minimize the coil resistance by using thick conductor lines and electroplated vias. In this structure, a 30 /spl mu/m thick nickel-iron permalloy magnetic core is wrapped with 40 /spl mu/m thick multilevel copper conductor lines, constructing a conventional toroidal inductor in planar shape. A closed magnetic circuit (i.e., toroidal) in this inductive component is adopted, where magnetic core bar and wrapped conductor lines are tightly interlinked, so that leakage flux and electromagnetic interference are minimized. For an inductor size of 4 mm/spl times/1 mm/spl times/130 /spl mu/m thickness having 33 turns of multilevel coils, the achieved inductance is approximately 0.4-0.1 /spl mu/H at 1 kHz-1 MHz, corresponding to a core permeability of approximately 800. The measured dc resistance of the conductor lines is approximately 0.3 /spl Omega/. Since this inductive component shows favorable magnetic characteristics as well as electrical properties, it is potentially very useful as a basic inductive component in applications for magnetic microsensors, microactuators, and micromagnetic power devices such as a dc/dc converter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/95.311757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/7559/00311757.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.311757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","startPage":"463","endPage":"469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully integrated planar toroidal inductor with a micromachined nickel-iron magnetic bar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=311757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"A fully integrated planar toroidal inductor with a micromachined nickel-iron magnetic bar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311757/","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4773088","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully integrated planar toroidal inductor with a micromachined nickel-iron magnetic bar","sourcePdf":"00311757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031402S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"39","articleId":"311757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":311758,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

This is accomplished by a parametric function that transforms either U or /spl Lambda//sub X/ to better match each other. The functional form of the transformation depends on prior knowledge about the mismatch, and the parameters are estimated along with the recognized string in a maximum-likelihood manner. experimental results verify the efficacy of the approach in improving the performance of a continuous speech recognition system in the presence of mismatch due to different transducers and transmission channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/311815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4773035","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic matching for robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic matching for robust speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00311815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02394S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"10","articleId":"311815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":311828,"authors":[{"name":"H.V.

It creates strong, but widely varied, images that may range from the final seconds of an athletic contest to a graduation ceremony to the loss of 10 pounds. Success makes us feel good; it's cause for celebration. All these examples of success are marked by a measurable end point, whether externally or self-created. Most of us who create software approach projects with some similar idea of success. Our feelings from project start to end are often strongly influenced by whether we spent any early time describing this success and how we might measure progress. Software metrics measure specific attributes of a software product or a software development process. In other words, they are measures of success. It's convenient to group the ways that we apply metrics to measure success into four areas. What do you need to measure and analyze to make your project a success? We show examples from many projects and Hewlett Packard divisions which may help you chart your course.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.312034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.312034","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/7569/00312034.pdf","startPage":"18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successfully applying software metrics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312034/","displayDocTitle":"Successfully applying software metrics","volume":"27","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4786213","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successfully applying software metrics","sourcePdf":"00312034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070043S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"43","articleId":"312034","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312091,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Approximately 32,000 new cases of malignant melanoma were diagnosed in 1991 in the United States, with approximately 80% of patients expected to survive 5 years. Fortunately, if detected early, even malignant melanoma may be treated successfully, Thus, in recent years, there has been rising interest in the automated detection and diagnosis of skin cancer, particularly malignant melanoma. Here, the authors present a novel neural network approach for the automated separation of melanoma from 3 benign categories of tumors which exhibit melanoma-like characteristics. The approach uses discriminant features, based on tumor shape and relative tumor color, that are supplied to an artificial neural network for classification of tumor images as malignant or benign. With this approach, for reasonably balanced training/testing sets, the authors are able to obtain above 80% correct classification of the malignant and benign tumors on real skin tumor images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.312091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7570/00312091.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.312091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network diagnosis of malignant melanoma from color images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network diagnosis of malignant melanoma from color images","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774373","pubMedId":"7959811","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network diagnosis of malignant melanoma from color images","sourcePdf":"00312091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063719S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"158","articleId":"312091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312126,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Our design is layered, and comprises three main components: a leader election, a spanning tree construction, and a diffusing computation. Each of these components is self-stabilizing in the following sense: if the coordination between the up-processes in the system is ever lost (due to failures or repairs of processes and channels), then each component eventually reaches a state where coordination is regained. This capability makes our reset subsystem very robust: it can tolerate fail-stop failures and repairs of processes and channels, even when a reset is in progress.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.312126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7571/00312126.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.312126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed reset","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nominations and elections","Fault tolerance","Robustness","Communication channels","Distributed computing","Signal processing","Computer science","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","fault tolerant computing","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed reset subsystem","embedded system","layered design","leader election","spanning tree construction","diffusing computation","self-stabilizing components","up-process coordination","process failures","process repairs","robustness","fail-stop failure tolerance","channel failures","channel repairs","reliability","fault tolerance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Distributed reset","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4761620","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312126/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed reset","sourcePdf":"00312126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042555S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"163","articleId":"312126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":312127,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Ju Hou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Chao-Ju Hou","id":"37087144661"},{"name":"K.G.

We propose a new load sharing (LS) algorithm for real-time applications which takes into account the effect of future task arrivals on locating the best receiver for each unguaranteed task. Upon arrival of a task at a node, the node first checks whether it can complete the task in time using the minimum-laxity-first-served discipline. If the node cannot guarantee the arrived task, or if some of existing guarantees were to be invalidated as a result of inserting the task into its queue, then the node must locate a remote node to which each unguaranteed task is to be transferred. The LS algorithm minimizes not only the probability of transferring an unguaranteed task T to an incapable node with Bayesian analysis, but also the probability that a remote node fails to guarantee T because of future arrivals of tighter-laxity tasks with queueing analysis. All parameters needed for a node's LS decision are collected/estimated online using time-stamped region-change broadcasts (TSRCBs) and Bayesian estimation. By using TSRCBs, the collected state information can be used to estimate other nodes' states. Use of Bayesian estimation makes the LS algorithm adaptive to dynamically varying workloads with little computational overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed LS algorithm outperforms other LS algorithms in minimizing the probability of dynamic failure, task collisions and excessive task transfers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7571/00312127.pdf","doi":"10.1109/12.312127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.312127","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load sharing with consideration of future task arrivals in heterogeneous distributed real-time systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312127/","displayDocTitle":"Load sharing with consideration of future task arrivals in heterogeneous distributed real-time systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4761624","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load sharing with consideration of future task arrivals in heterogeneous distributed real-time systems","sourcePdf":"00312127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060292S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"19","articleId":"312127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":312138,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This new method focuses on deriving formulas which are recursively related to their orders, and thus making it also applicable to numerical solutions. Concerning the procedures needed to obtain the analytical solutions, this new method proves to be simpler than conventional methods, because the results consist of a sum of two functions which can be easily calculated recursively. It must be noted that the formula can be represented as a complete recursion by separating the coefficients in the manner originated by the authors. The resulting equation is the sum of the original \"sinc\" functions shifted by some symmetrical factors and then multiplied by several constants. The constants are easily determined by the binomial coefficients and the shifting factors from the corresponding exponential differences in the expansion of (a+b)/sup n/. Furthermore, a lookup table is obtained, making it possible to get all the coefficients and factors needed for the Fourier transform of the cosine-pulses of any order.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel1/13/7572/00312144.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","doi":"10.1109/13.312144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/13.312144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The look-up table for deriving the Fourier transforms of cosine-pulses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Fourier transforms","Transversal filters","Equations","Transfer functions","Communication systems","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","difference equations","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","cosine-pulses","uniform amplitudes","recursive relations","sinc functions sum","binomial coefficients","modified class-I PRS system model","difference equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"The look-up table for deriving the Fourier transforms of cosine-pulses","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4756164","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The look-up table for deriving the Fourier transforms of cosine-pulses","sourcePdf":"00312144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056631S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"5","articleId":"312144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":312147,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

These include the codes constructed by Nordstrom-Robinson (1967), Kerdock (1972), Preparata (1968), Goethals (1974), and Delsarte-Goethals (1975). It is shown here that all these codes can be very simply constructed as binary images under the Gray map of linear codes over Z/sub 4/, the integers mod 4 (although this requires a slight modification of the Preparata and Goethals codes). The construction implies that all these binary codes are distance invariant. Duality in the Z/sub 4/ domain implies that the binary images have dual weight distributions. The Kerdock and \"Preparata\" codes are duals over Z/sub 4/-and the Nordstrom-Robinson code is self-dual-which explains why their weight distributions are dual to each other. The Kerdock and \"Preparata\" codes are Z/sub 4/-analogues of first-order Reed-Muller and extended Hamming codes, respectively. All these codes are extended cyclic codes over Z/sub 4/, which greatly simplifies encoding and decoding. An algebraic hard-decision decoding algorithm is given for the \"Preparata\" code and a Hadamard-transform soft-decision decoding algorithm for the I(Kerdock code. Binary first- and second-order Reed-Muller codes are also linear over Z/sub 4/, but extended Hamming codes of length n/spl ges/32 and the Golay code are not. Using Z/sub 4/-linearity, a new family of distance regular graphs are constructed on the cosets of the \"Preparata\" code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.312154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/7573/00312154.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.312154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Z/sub 4/-linearity of Kerdock, Preparata, Goethals, and related codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"The Z/sub 4/-linearity of Kerdock, Preparata, Goethals, and related codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312154/","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761477","volume":"40","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Z/sub 4/-linearity of Kerdock, Preparata, Goethals, and related codes","sourcePdf":"00312154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051837S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"810","articleId":"312154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":312155,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We assume a general system structure that may contain causal and noncausal poles and zeros. The parameters characterizing the input PDF may also be unknown. We derive an asymptotic expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and show that it is the highest (worst) in the Gaussian case, indicating that the estimation accuracy can only be improved when the input PDF is non-Gaussian. It is further shown that the asymptotic error variance in estimating the system parameters is unaffected by lack of knowledge of the PDF parameters, and vice verse. Computationally efficient gradient-based algorithms for finding the maximum likelihood estimate of the unknown system and PDF parameters, which incorporate backward filtering for the identification of non-causal parameters, are presented. The dual problem of blind deconvolution/equalization is considered, and asymptotically attainable lower bounds on the equalization performance are derived. These bounds imply that it is preferable to work with compact equalizer structures characterized by a small number of parameters as the attainable performance depend only on the total number of equalizer parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.312156","startPage":"328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/7573/00312156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.312156","endPage":"339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood and lower bounds in system identification with non-Gaussian inputs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood and lower bounds in system identification with non-Gaussian inputs","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761479","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood and lower bounds in system identification with non-Gaussian inputs","sourcePdf":"00312156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053439S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","articleId":"312156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":312157,"authors":[{"name":"Lang Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Lang Tong","id":"37276976900"},{"name":"Guanghan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Guanghan Xu","id":"37271442400"},{"name":"T.

Moreover, since it is based on second-order statistics, the new approach may achieve equalization with fewer symbols than most techniques based only on higher-order statistics.

The author regards an IC as a code without restrictions employed for the AWGN channel. For an IC the concept of coding rate is meaningless and the author uses, instead of coding rate, the normalized logarithmic density (NLD). The maximum value C/sub /spl infin// such that, for any NLD less than C/sub /spl infin//, it is possible to construct an PC with arbitrarily small decoding error probability, is called the generalized capacity of the AWGN channel without restrictions. The author derives exponential upper and lower bounds for the decoding error probability of an IC, expressed in terms of the NLD. The upper bound is obtained by means of a random coding method and it is very similar to the usual random coding bound for the AWGN channel. The exponents of these upper and lower bounds coincide for high values of the NLD, thereby enabling derivation of the generalized capacity of the AWGN channel without restrictions. It is also shown that the exponent of the random coding bound can be attained by linear ICs (lattices), implying that lattices play the same role with respect to the AWGN channel as linear-codes do with respect to a discrete symmetric channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.312163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/7573/00312163.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.312163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On coding without restrictions for the AWGN channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"On coding without restrictions for the AWGN channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312163/","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761486","volume":"40","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On coding without restrictions for the AWGN channel","sourcePdf":"00312163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024541S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"179","articleId":"312163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":312164,"authors":[{"name":"L.K.

A preference order is established for the frequency weights in multiple Fourier expansions and the connection weights in single hidden-layer neural networks. These preferred weight vectors, called good weights (good lattice weights for estimation of periodic functions), are generalizations for arbitrary periods of the hyperbolic lattice points of Korobov (1959) and Hlawka (1962) associated with classes of smooth functions of period one in each variable. Although previous results on approximation and quadrature are affinely invariant to the scale of the underlying periods, some of our results deal with optimization over finite sets and strongly depend on the choice of scale. It is shown how to count and generate good lattice weights. Finite sample bounds on mean integrated squared error are calculated for ridge estimates of periodic pattern class densities. The bounds are combined with a table of cardinalities of good lattice weight sets to furnish classifier design with prescribed class density estimation errors. Applications are presented for neural networks and projection pursuit. A hyperbolic kernel gradient transform is developed which automatically determines the training weights (projection directions).

We employ results from harmonic analysis and the theory of rational approximation to obtain almost tight lower bounds on the size (i.e., number of elements) of neural networks. The class of neural networks to which our techniques can be applied is quite general it includes any feedforward network in which each element can be piecewise approximated by a low degree rational function. For example, we prove that any depth-d+1 network of sigmoidal units or linear threshold elements computing the parity function of n variables must have R(dn/sup 1//d-/spl epsiv/) size, for any fixed /spl epsiv/>0. In addition, we prove that this lower bound is almost tight by showing that the parity function can be computed with O(dn/sup 1/d/) sigmoidal units or linear threshold elements in a depth-(d+1) network. These almost tight bounds are the first known complexity results on the size of neural networks with depth more than two. Our lower bound techniques yield a unified approach to the complexity analysis of various models of neural networks with feedforward structures. Moreover, our results indicate that the in the context of computing highly oscillating symmetric Boolean functions, networks of continuous-output units such as sigmoidal elements do not offer significant reduction in size compared with networks of linear threshold elements of binary outputs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.312168","startPage":"455","endPage":"466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/7573/00312168.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.312168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rational approximation techniques for analysis of neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computer networks","Artificial neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Harmonic analysis","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","linear network analysis","approximation theory","threshold elements","harmonic analysis","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","rational approximation","linear threshold elements","sigmoidal elements","radial-basis elements","harmonic analysis","lower bounds","feedforward network","parity function","complexity analysis","oscillating symmetric Boolean functions","continuous-output units","binary outputs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312168/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Rational approximation techniques for analysis of neural networks","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4761490","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rational approximation techniques for analysis of neural networks","sourcePdf":"00312168.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060231S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","articleId":"312168","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":312169,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

The free squared Euclidean distance, d/sub free//sup 2/, at the channel output is lower bounded by the free Hamming distance of the convolutional code. The lower bound suggests the use of a convolutional code with maximal free Hamming distance, d/sub max/(R,N), for given rate R and number of decoder states N. In this paper we present cosets of convolutional codes that generate trellis codes with d/sub free//sup 2/>d/sub max/(R,N) for rates 1/5/spl les/R/spl les/7/9 and (d/sub free//sup 2/=d/sub max/(R,N) for R=13/16,29/32,61/64, The tabulated convolutional codes with R/spl les/7/9 were not optimized for Hamming distance. Instead, a computer search was used to determine cosets of convolutional codes that exploit the memory of the 1-D channel to increase d/sub free//sup 2/ at the channel output. The search was limited by only considering cosets with certain structural properties. The R/spl ges/13/16 codes were obtained using a new construction technique for convolutional codes with free Hamming distance 4. Newly developed bounds on the maximum zero-run lengths of cosets were used to ensure a short maximum run length at the 1-D channel output.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved coding techniques for preceded partial-response channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.312170","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/7573/00312170.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.312170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Improved coding techniques for preceded partial-response channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4761493","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved coding techniques for preceded partial-response channels","sourcePdf":"00312170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035401S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","articleId":"312170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":312173,"authors":[{"name":"Xuemin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Xuemin Chen","id":"37349530800"},{"name":"I.S.

For every length N, we derive restrictions on the location of the zero elements and on the form of the member sequences of the pair. We also derive a bound on the minimum number of zeros necessary for the existence of a complementary pair of length N over /spl alpha//sub 3/.

First, using a result of Csiszar (1973) the asymptotic (i.e., high-resolution/low distortion) performance for entropy-constrained tessellating vector quantization, heuristically derived by Gersho (1979), is proven for all sources with finite differential entropy. This implies, using Gersho's conjecture and Zador's formula, that tessellating vector quantizers are asymptotically optimal for this broad class of sources, and generalizes a rigorous result of Gish and Pierce (1968) from the scalar to the vector case. Second, the asymptotic performance is established for Zamir and Feder's (1992) randomized lattice quantization. With the only assumption that the source has finite differential entropy, it is proven that the low-distortion performance of the Zamir-Feder universal vector quantizer is asympotically the same as that of the deterministic lattice quantizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.312189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/7573/00312189.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.312189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic entropy-constrained performance of tessellating and universal randomized lattice quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312189/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic entropy-constrained performance of tessellating and universal randomized lattice quantization","volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4761511","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic entropy-constrained performance of tessellating and universal randomized lattice quantization","sourcePdf":"00312189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036494S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","articleId":"312189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312261,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The thin film inductor has a sandwich structure, which consists of a double-rectangular spiral coil between top and bottom CoZrNb amorphous thin films. The sputtered CoZrNb amorphous magnetic thin films have uniaxial magnetic anisotropy induced by direct current field annealing. The easy magnetization axis is directed to the main axis of the rectangular spiral coil. Hence, only the rotation magnetization process dominates in this device. The typical specifications are as follows; 3.5/spl times/5.5 mm in size, inductance of 1 /spl mu/H constant up to 10 MHz, and a quality factor of 10 at 10 MHz. A MHz switching chopper dc-dc converter has been developed by using this thin film inductor, bare-chip semiconductor devices (a power MOSFET and a Schottky barrier diode), and a multilayer ceramic capacitor.

The class IV partial response channel (PR4) behaves as the interleaving of two identical run-length limited (RLL) channels. Efficient recording codes for the PR4 channel have been made by considering a channel bit sequence to be composed of two interleaved subsequences. Finite state techniques are used to describe run-length constraints on each subsequence as well as a global run-length constraint on both sequences combined. A recent paper by Swanson and Wolf discusses multichannel run-length limited codes that turn out to be very similar to interleaved run-length limited codes. The present paper discusses the similarities between the code description of multichannel RLL codes and the interleaved RLL codes required by the PR4 channel. The extension of the techniques of multichannel RLL work to the interleaved problem is discussed. It was found that suitable code constructions are possible by viewing the problem as two distinct RLL codes that have individual maximum run-lengths onto which a global run-length is imposed. Two examples are developed to illustrate the ideas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00312506.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7917686/00312506.pdf","startPage":"2769","endPage":"2777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.312506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.312506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7917686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An alternative construction of interleaved RLL codes for partial response channels using multichannel methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial response channels","Magnetic recording","Clocks","Interleaved codes","Maximum likelihood detection","Delay","Timing","Modulation coding","Interference constraints","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic recording","codes","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved RLL codes","partial response channels","multichannel methods","alternative construction","magnetic recording channels","recording density","partial response communication methods","maximum likelihood detection","class IV partial response channel","interleaving","identical run-length limited channels","efficient recording codes","PR4 channel","channel bit sequence","interleaved subsequences","finite state techniques","global run-length constraint","multichannel run-length limited codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"An alternative construction of interleaved RLL codes for partial response channels using multichannel methods","volume":"30","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774523","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative construction of interleaved RLL codes for partial response channels using multichannel methods","sourcePdf":"00312506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035418S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7917686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"2","articleId":"312506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312518,"authors":[{"name":"Jaekyun Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Jaekyun Moon","id":"37276690000"},{"name":"Sian She","affiliation":["Cirrus Logic, Inc., Broomfield, CO, USA"],"lastName":"Sian She","id":"37352371600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"312518","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":40},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Decision feedback equalizers","Maximum likelihood detection","Moon","Detectors","Finite impulse response filter","Signal processing","Magnetic separation","Magnetic recording","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic recording","feedback","transient response","signal processing","tree data structures","codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained-complexity equalizer design","fixed delay tree search","decision feedback","hybrid detection scheme","sequence detector","decision feedback equalizer","minimum-runlength-limited channels","near-optimal detection performance","complexity requirement","search depth","channel subject","asymptotically-equivalent performance","asymptotic optimality","signal-to-noise ratio argument","design criterion","tap weights","finite impulse response structure","forward filters","feedback filters","optimal tap weights","magnetic recording channel","popular minimum runlength constraint"]}],"abstract":"Fixed delay tree search with decision feedback (FDTS/DF) is a hybrid detection scheme which incorporates a sequence detector into the decision feedback equalizer (DFE). When applied to minimum-runlength-limited channels, the FDTS/DP provides near-optimal detection performance with a reasonable complexity requirement. It has been shown recently that for the special case of search depth 1 and the channel subject to the d=1 run length constraint, a simpler structure arises for the decision elements of the FDTS/DF, which provides asymptotically-equivalent performance to the originally proposed FDTS/DF structure. We demonstrate the asymptotic optimality of this reduced FDTS/DF based on a simple signal-to-noise ratio argument. We also introduce a design criterion for choosing tap weights for the constrained-complexity FDTS/DF, which assumes the finite impulse response (FIR) structure for its forward and feedback filters. A method to compute optimal tap weights for the forward and feedback filters is then presented for a magnetic recording channel subject to the popular minimum runlength constraint, d=1. Results show that under the d=1 constraint, the FDTS/DF with one-bit decision delay achieves a large performance improvement over the DFE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.312518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7917686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7917686/00312518.pdf","endPage":"2768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained-complexity equalizer design for fixed delay tree search with decision feedback","doi":"10.1109/20.312518","startPage":"2762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Constrained-complexity equalizer design for fixed delay tree search with decision feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312518/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4774522","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained-complexity equalizer design for fixed delay tree search with decision feedback","sourcePdf":"00312518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065679S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7917686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","articleId":"312518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":312519,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The merits of the method are illustrated in the light of three example cases. The first two samples deal with inverse electrostatic problems which are relevant for nondestructive testing applications. In a first problem, a boss on an earthed plane is identified on the basis of the map of potential produced by a point charge. In the second problem, the geometric parameters of an ellipsoid carrying an electric charge are identified. In both cases, database of simulated measurements has been generated thanks to the available analytical solutions. As a sample magnetic inverse problem, the identification of a circular plasma in a tokamak device from external flux measurements is carried out.

The maximum field intensity for each new design is reduced to 2.000 kV/mm from 2.633 kV/mm under 100 kV applied voltage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.312554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7575/00312554.pdf","startPage":"2944","endPage":"2947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.312554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of insulated structure for load-ratio voltage power transformer by finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312554/","displayDocTitle":"Design of insulated structure for load-ratio voltage power transformer by finite element method","volume":"30","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774551","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of insulated structure for load-ratio voltage power transformer by finite element method","sourcePdf":"00312554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051983S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","articleId":"312554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":312561,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In those cases it can easily be shown that (some of) the electromagnetic compatibility relations (field properties that follow from Maxwell's equations) are not satisfied. The divergence condition on the fluxes, for instance, follows directly from the field equations but not necessarily from their discretized counterparts. This necessitates inclusion of the compatibility relations in the finite-element formulation of the field problem. A survey is given of all electromagnetic compatibility relations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00312561.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7575/00312561.pdf","startPage":"2972","endPage":"2975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.312561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.312561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compatibility relations and the finite-element formulation of electromagnetic field problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Electromagnetic fields","Maxwell equations","Electromagnetic compatibility","Magnetic analysis","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic analysis","Magnetic fields","Magnetic flux","Electromagnetic transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic compatibility","finite element analysis","electromagnetic fields","Maxwell equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compatibility relations","finite-element formulation","electromagnetic field problems","Maxwell's equations","electromagnetic compatibility","divergence condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Compatibility relations and the finite-element formulation of electromagnetic field problems","volume":"30","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compatibility relations and the finite-element formulation of electromagnetic field problems","sourcePdf":"00312561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026841S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"19","articleId":"312561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312563,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To deal with these problems we propose to use the T/sub 0//spl Omega/ formulation and describe the way of coupling magnetic and electric circuit equations. The coupling is obtained by expressing the electric vector potential T/sub 0/ from the current and the flux of induction and from the magnetic scalar potential /spl Omega/. To consider the magnetic nonlinearity we use the Newton-Raphson procedure. This formulation is used to model a 100 MVA power transformer short circuit test in the transient state. The same device is studied at no-load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.312624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7575/00312624.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.312624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7575","startPage":"3224","endPage":"3227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical simulation of a power transformer using 3D finite element method coupled to circuit equation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical simulation of a power transformer using 3D finite element method coupled to circuit equation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774620","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical simulation of a power transformer using 3D finite element method coupled to circuit equation","sourcePdf":"00312624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051725S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"32","articleId":"312624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312627,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We address those problems for which a theoretical solution exists in the form of a superposition of some basis functions. The algorithm introduced employs this same set of basis functions, and finds the expansion coefficients by the use of an iterative error-minimization technique, which resembles those found in the process of training of artificial neural networks. In cases where the expansion functions are orthonormal, guaranteed fast convergence is proved. As well, we show how neuro-computation techniques can be employed to circumvent the effects of various types of measurement errors and noise. Satisfactory performance of the algorithm is shown for a test problem driven by random inputs corrupted with various levels of Gaussian noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

In this paper, the load characteristics of a coupling transformer are analyzed by the 3-D finite element method with edge elements.

The codec is currently under standardization by the ITU-T (successor of CCITT) where the codec terms of reference were mainly determined considering PCS application. The encoding algorithm is based on algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP) and has a speech frame of 10 ms. Efficient pitch and codebook search strategies, along with efficient quantization procedures, have been developed to achieve toll quality encoded speech with a complexity implementable on current fixed-point DSP chips. Formal subjective listening tests, performed by ITU-T SG 12, showed that the codec quality is equivalent to that of G.726 ADPCM at 32 kb/s in error-free conditions and it outperforms G.726 under error conditions. The codec performs adequately under tandeming conditions, and can support a frame erasure rate up to 3% with a degradation in its performance that is still worse than the ITU-T requirements, and this is one subject of study for the next phase. The algorithm has been implemented on a single fixed-point DSP for the ITU-T subjective rest, and required about 29 MIPS. An optimized version, however, requires 24 MIPS without any speech quality degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312763.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.312763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A toll quality 8 kb/s speech codec for the personal communications system (PCS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech codecs","Degradation","Standardization","Personal communication networks","Encoding","Quantization","Digital signal processing chips","Testing","Performance evaluation","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech coding","codecs","vocoders","personal communication networks","mobile radio systems","telecommunication standards","linear predictive coding","analogue-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["toll quality 8 kb/s speech codec","personal communications system","PCS","algebraic code-excited linear prediction","ACELP","speech frame","pitch","codebook search strategies","quantization procedures","encoded speech","fixed-point DSP chips","subjective listening tests","quality","tandeming conditions","frame erasure rate","degradation","fixed-point DSP","ITU-T subjective test","speech quality","8 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"A toll quality 8 kb/s speech codec for the personal communications system (PCS)","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761786","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A toll quality 8 kb/s speech codec for the personal communications system (PCS)","sourcePdf":"00312763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070809S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"77","articleId":"312763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312764,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.A. Jalloul","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA","Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"L.M.A.","lastName":"Jalloul","id":"37326068700"},{"name":"J.M.

For narrow-band signals, the envelope of the received signal is well characterized by a Rayleigh random process. Rayleigh fading causes large variations in the signal envelope. For wide-band signals, the effect of Rayleigh fading is mitigated. The paper considers the effect of receiver processing on the mitigation effect for wide-band DS/CDMA signals. The mitigation effect is shown by a reduction of the coefficient of variation of the received power as a function of bandwidth spreading. The parameters chip rate, processing gain, and the number of multipath components tracked are investigated for their effect upon the mitigation-the mitigation effect is sensitive to combinations of these parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.312764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312764.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","startPage":"801","endPage":"807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath fading effects on wide-band DS/CDMA signals: analysis, simulation, and measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multipath fading effects on wide-band DS/CDMA signals: analysis, simulation, and measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761785","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath fading effects on wide-band DS/CDMA signals: analysis, simulation, and measurements","sourcePdf":"00312764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030206S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","articleId":"312764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":312765,"authors":[{"name":"Yanpeng Guo","affiliation":["Digital Communications Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yanpeng Guo","id":"37349279900"},{"name":"K.

The authors apply the constant envelope FQPSK modem/radio architecture (filtered QPSK (Feher, 1982)) to a slow frequency hopping system to achieve higher spectrum efficiency as well as higher power efficiency. Being a constant envelope system, SFH-FQPSK can operate with class C power amplifier without output backoff (OBO). Therefore, it is 4-7 dB more power efficient than T/4-QPSK which is currently adopted as the US digital cellular and Japanese handyphone PCS standards. As compared to the European DECT and GSM standard GMSK, the proposed SFH-FQPSK is about 50% more spectrally efficient. The BER performance of this system, employing convolutional coding and Viterbi decoding for FEC, is evaluated in a Rayleigh fading/AWGN environment. Results show that the BER performance of the authors hard-limited SFH/FQPSK is as good as that of linear SFH coherent QPSK (SFH-CQPSK), and is 3 and 5 dB better than ideal coherent QPSK and differentially encoded coherent QPSK (DEQPSK) systems, respectively. With the higher spectral and power efficiency and superior BER performance, the authors conclude that the proposed SFH-FQPSK is an excellent candidate for the future high-capacity PCS networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.312765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312765.pdf","startPage":"795","endPage":"800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and spectrally efficient SFH-FQPSK for PCS applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312765/","displayDocTitle":"Power and spectrally efficient SFH-FQPSK for PCS applications","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761784","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and spectrally efficient SFH-FQPSK for PCS applications","sourcePdf":"00312765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041804S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","articleId":"312765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":312768,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Rong Chang","id":"37087180789"},{"name":"Bao-Fuh Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bao-Fuh Yeh","id":"37087327502"},{"name":"Chih-Chiang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Chiang Chang","id":"37087751723"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"312768","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312768","abstract":"This paper investigates the application of the multilayer perceptron structure to the packet-wise adaptive decision feedback equalization of a M-ary QAM signal through a TDMA indoor radio channel in the presence of intersymbol interference (ISI) and additive Gaussian noise. Since the multilayer neural networks are capable of producing complex decision regions with arbitrarily nonlinear boundaries, this would greatly improve the performance of conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) where the decision boundaries of conventional DFE are linear. However, the applications of the traditional multilayer neural networks have been limited to real-valued signals. To tackle this difficulty, a neural-based DPE is proposed to deal with the complex QAM signal over the complex-valued fading multipath radio channel without performing time-consuming complex-valued back-propagation training algorithms, while maintaining almost the same computational complexity as the original real-valued training algorithm. Moreover, this neural-based DFE trained by packet-wise backpropagation algorithm would approach an ideal equalizer after receiving a sufficient number of packets. In this paper, another fast packet-wise training algorithm with better convergence properties is derived on the basis of a recursive least-squares (RLS) routine. Results show that the neural-based DFE trained by both algorithms provides a superior bit-error-rate performance relative to the conventional least mean square (LMS) DFE, especially in poor signal to noise ratio conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.312768","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00312768.png","startPage":"773","endPage":"780","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312768.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive packet equalization for indoor radio channel using multilayer neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers","Indoor radio communication","Decision feedback equalizers","Backpropagation algorithms","Multi-layer neural network","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Intersymbol interference","Neural networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","mobile radio systems","intersymbol interference","radiofrequency interference","packet radio networks","telecommunication channels","amplitude modulation","time division multiple access","random noise","feedforward neural nets","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive packet equalization","indoor radio channel","multilayer neural networks","adaptive decision feedback equalization","M-ary QAM signal","TDMA","intersymbol interference","ISI","additive Gaussian noise","fading multipath radio channel","computational complexity","packet-wise backpropagation algorithm","convergence properties","recursive least-squares","RLS","bit-error-rate","signal to noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive packet equalization for indoor radio channel using multilayer neural networks","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4761781","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive packet equalization for indoor radio channel using multilayer neural networks","sourcePdf":"00312768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089471S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","articleId":"312768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":312769,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wei","affiliation":["Signal Processing Research Institute, University of South Australia, SA, Australia"],"lastName":"Lei Wei","id":"37273200500"},{"name":"C.

This indicates that accurate prediction of signal and interference levels is possible through simulation rather than costly field measurements. Using building and street databases, the model can be used to predict the signal coverage and interference in large cities, thus allowing system designers to determine cell layouts, reuse factors, capacity, etc. Furthermore, theoretical microcell coverage areas were determined and compared to existing diamond-shape models at 900 MHz and 2 GHz with the base-station antenna located in the intersection.

The forced termination of an ongoing call is considered less desirable than blocking the initial access of a new call. The paper proposes analytic and simulation models to study the performance of different channel assignment strategies for hand-off and initial access. The authors observe that giving priority to hand-off attempts over initial access attempts would dramatically improve the forced termination probability of the system without seriously degrading the number of failed initial access attempts.

The goal is to estimate what improvements are possible using narrow-beam adaptive antenna techniques, assuming that adaptive algorithms and the associated hardware to implement these systems can be realized. Simulations and analytical results are presented which demonstrate that steerable direction antennas at the base station can dramatically improve the reverse channel performance of multicell mobile radio systems, and new analytical techniques for characterizing mobile radio systems which employ frequency reuse are described using the wedge-cell geometry of Rappaport and Milstein (1992). The authors also discuss the effects of using directional antennas at the portable unit.

The user of a cellular or personal communication system wants to use one phone for all of his intended needs. Thus, a single portable phone should be able to operate in a residence, as a cordless phone; in a vehicle using a cellular system, in an office using a WPBX; and outside with wireless local access. Broad-band code-division multiple access (B-CDMA) is a technique which allows PCS operation in the cellular frequency band in conjunction with existing cellular service, as well as in the PCS band (1850-1990 MHz in the U.S.). Using B-CDMA, high-quality voice with no dropped calls as well as data-rate-on-demand can be achieved, which will permit ISDN and multimedia communications at power levels which are much less than that required for other technologies. This paper describes the present cellular and PCS environments, as well as the evolution of these environments into the 21st century, and explains how broad-band CDMA can provide the one-phone service required by business people as well as people at home.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761763","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Wireless communications going into the 21st century","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless communications going into the 21st century","sourcePdf":"00312786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022113S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","articleId":"312786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":312789,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For a system with a very large number of users, this implies a very complex central station. The authors develop a more efficient DS-CDMA protocol for centralized packet radio networks, which reduces the central station complexity in terms of the required number of receivers, while maintaining the channel throughput at an acceptable level. To reduce the central station complexity, the authors group all system users into cells and assume that all users in a given cell use the same spread spectrum code. It is found that the central station complexity reduction can be obtained at the price of throughput reduction. However, with an appropriate choice of system parameters, the throughput reduction can be made insignificant compared to the reduction achieved with the required number of receivers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.312789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312789.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced complexity DS-CDMA system for personal communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312789/","displayDocTitle":"A reduced complexity DS-CDMA system for personal communication networks","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761760","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced complexity DS-CDMA system for personal communication networks","sourcePdf":"00312789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036874S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"312789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":312790,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The research aspect of the paper reports on the results of recent frequency response measurements at eight different sites in a university building. A major result shows that the indoor wireless optical channel is very dynamic, with great variations in the channel's characteristics for data collected in different rooms, in different locations within the same room, and for different orientations of the optical receiver at the same location of the same room. Numerical values of the channel's relative path loss and 3 dB bandwidth, along with frequency response plots covering a wide range of conditions, are presented and discussed.

The bit error rate (BER) of a mobile unit at any given distance from the base station is obtained for both the forward link and the reverse link, taking into account Rayleigh fading and UHF propagation attenuation, To this end, a simple multiple-cell-system model is developed. Our work shows the dependence of performance gain on the different user spatial distributions under power control. Also, it is shown that power control in the forward link of CDMA networks may lead to a dismal performance degradation for close-in users. To alleviate this problem, the adjusted power control scheme is revisited. Two different performance criteria are proposed for this purpose, and the optimal threshold values corresponding to these criteria are computed. Results indicate that, although both threshold criteria are acceptable, the second criterion is more recommendable from a BER performance point of view, because it circumvents the so-called service \"hole\" problem which may occur when one uses the first criterion. The analysis for both the forward and reverse links leads to closed-form signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) results, which not only facilitate physical insight into the impact of key system parameters on the system performance of CDMA networks with power control, but may also eliminate the need for cumbersome Monte-Carlo-type simulations. It is shown that fourth-order power control (n=4) leads to at least a threefold enhancement in capacity for BER=10/sup -3/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.312795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312795.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular CDMA networks impaired by Rayleigh fading: system performance with power control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312795/","displayDocTitle":"Cellular CDMA networks impaired by Rayleigh fading: system performance with power control","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761754","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular CDMA networks impaired by Rayleigh fading: system performance with power control","sourcePdf":"00312795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054758S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","articleId":"312795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":312797,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Osaka Institute of Technology, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Hong Zhou","id":"37087297340"},{"name":"R.H.

In an urban area when 2/spl Delta/f is 3 MHz, the level difference between the cumulative probability 50% and 1% values is about 5 dB. Second, received signal-level distribution depends on the number of arriving waves N and path length difference |/spl Delta/L/sub ij/|. The level depth becomes shallower with increasing N and |/spl Delta/L/sub ij/|. Third, received signal-level distribution is almost independent of radio frequency f/sub c/. The author also derives expressions for the autocorrelation coefficient /spl rho/(z) and frequency coefficient /spl rho/(s) of the received signal level. /spl rho/(z) is independent of 2/spl Delta/f, and is about J/sub 0/(Z//spl lambda//sub c/)/sup 2/, which is known as narrow-band reception. The /spl rho/(s) becomes higher with increasing 2/spl Delta/f.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312798/","volume":"43","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4761751","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Received signal-level characteristics in a wide-band mobile radio channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Received signal-level characteristics in a wide-band mobile radio channel","sourcePdf":"00312798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141286S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","articleId":"312798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":312802,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

For best results, the measurement filter bandwidth must be sufficiently narrow to average out multipath fluctuations, yet sufficiently wide to follow shadow fading fluctuations. Our study considers two measurement methods (filtering the squared envelope, and filtering the logarithm of the squared envelope), and two filter types (integrate-and-dump and RC). We show, using standard models for the multipath and shadow fadings, that the dB measurement error tends to be Gauss-distributed, and can readily be made unbiased (zero mean) by proper amplitude calibration. The performance metric then becomes the standard deviation (/spl Delta/) of the dB error, which can be minimized by proper choice of the filter bandwidth. We find that /spl Delta/ can be kept to values of 3 dB or lower over a wide range of mobile velocities and shadow fading characteristics. Also, we discuss the potential gains in measurement accuracy associated with diversity reception and broad-band channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.312802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312802.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error statistics of real-time power measurements in cellular channels with multipath and shadowing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312802/","displayDocTitle":"Error statistics of real-time power measurements in cellular channels with multipath and shadowing","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761747","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error statistics of real-time power measurements in cellular channels with multipath and shadowing","sourcePdf":"00312802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049696S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"122","articleId":"312802","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":312803,"authors":[{"name":"Kou-Tan Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kou-Tan Wu","id":"37065035800"},{"name":"Shuenn-An Tsaur","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan","Department of Electronics Engineering, Chinese Naval Academy, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shuenn-An Tsaur","id":"37654776500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"312803","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Diversity reception","Rayleigh channels","Multiaccess communication","Rician channels","Error probability","Interference","Time division multiple access","Nakagami distribution","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","error statistics","probability","fading","telecommunication channels","diversity reception","mobile radio systems","Reed-Solomon codes","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-SSMA communications","Nakagami fading channels","average error probability","outage probability","asynchronous binary communications","direct sequence spread-spectrum multiple access","slow nonselective fading","diversity reception","nondiversity reception","Gauss quadrature rule","multipath interference","multiple access interferences","conditional probability","fading amplitude","trapezoidal integration","PDF","Reed-Solomon codes","uncoded nondiversity DS-SSMA system","coded diversity system","Gold code","codelength","Reed-Solomon coding"]}],"abstract":"Average error probability and outage probability for asynchronous binary direct sequence spread-spectrum multiple access communications through slow nonselective Nakagami fading channels are evaluated for nondiversity and diversity receptions.

The desired speech quality is that of the full-rate coder, but the total bit rate specified for the half-rate is only 6.5 kb/s. Since the mobile communication channel is very noisy, the use of error-correcting codes is necessary, which leaves only about 4 kb/s for the actual speech information. This very restricted bit budget requires that fewer than 30 b be allotted to the quantization of the LSF parameters, which precludes the use of scalar quantization. In this work, a quantizer design procedure which is tailored for the transmission frame structure of the North-American (TIA) cellular communication standard is presented. It is basically a split vector quantizer which makes use of interframe prediction to lower the number of bits required for quantization. Since the prediction is performed only on every other frame, the error propagation is limited. The quantization technique yields good performance in the 26-27 b/frame range, and the complexity of its implementation is less than 0.5 Mip.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Frequency","Communication standards","Linear predictive coding","Bit rate","Filters","Mobile communication","Error correction codes","Speech coding","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","vocoders","error correction codes","telecommunication standards","vector quantisation","speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LSF quantizer","North-American half-rate speech coder","cellular communication standard","speech quality","bit rate","mobile communication channel","error-correcting codes","transmission frame structure","split vector quantizer","interframe prediction","error propagation","TIA","6.5 kbit/s"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.312805","startPage":"413","endPage":"419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7576/00312805.pdf","doi":"10.1109/25.312805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LSF quantizer for the North-American half-rate speech coder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"An LSF quantizer for the North-American half-rate speech coder","accessionNumber":"4761744","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","volume":"43","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LSF quantizer for the North-American half-rate speech coder","sourcePdf":"00312805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040931S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","articleId":"312805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":312808,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Ho Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Che-Ho Wei","id":"37334081600"},{"name":"Wen-Jiang Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Jiang Chen","id":"37655532400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"312808","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking loops","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Bit error rate","Computer errors","Nonuniform sampling","Phase locked loops","Phase detection","Detectors","Application software","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio systems","phase shift keying","phase-locked loops","tracking","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital tanlock loop","/spl pi//4-DQPSK signals tracking","digital cellular radio","nonuniform sampling digital PLL","DPLL","phase error detector","quadrature samples","in-phase samples","linear characteristic","performance degradation","fading effect","bit error rate","steady state phase error variance","computer simulation"]}],"abstract":"A digital tanlock loop (DTL) is a nonuniform sampling digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) whose phase error detector, using the tan/sup -1/[/spl middot/] function with in-phase and quadrature samples of incoming signal, has a linear characteristic with a period of 2/spl pi/.

The results presented in this paper provide insight into the statistical distributions of measured path loss by showing the validity of a double regression model with a break point at a distance that has first Fresnel zone clearance for line-of-sight topographies. The variation of delay spread as a function of path loss is also investigated, and a simple exponential overbound model is developed.

The FD-TD method is used to compute scattering from surface patches by converting the Maxwell's equations into difference equations using a central difference approximation for the space and time derivatives. The volume of grids above the rough surface is divided into the total field and the scattered field regions. In between these two regions, obliquely incident waves are generated. To reduce computation, the volume of grids is chosen to be small, and a transformation is used to convert the scattered field into far zone fields for bistatic scattering coefficient calculations. Possible errors near the edge of the surface due to the use of a relatively small volume are suppressed by introducing a windowing function. Very good agreements are obtained between the results obtained by this method and those calculated by an integral equation method (IEM) for scattering from randomly rough perfectly conducting and dielectric surfaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.312887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7578","startPage":"986","endPage":"994","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7578/00312887.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.312887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical simulation of scattering from three-dimensional randomly rough surfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical simulation","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Radar scattering","Surface waves","Difference equations","Moment methods","Maxwell equations","Grid computing","Integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing by radar","radar cross-sections","backscatter","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","S-matrix theory","geophysical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","radar remote sensing","radiowave reflection","radar scattering","backscatter","numerical simulation","three dimensional randomly rough surface","terrain mapping","rough surface patch","three dimensions","FD-TD method","Maxwell's equations","difference equations","central difference approximation","oblique incidence","bistatic scattering coefficient calculation","windowing function","land surface","finite difference time domain method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Numerical simulation of scattering from three-dimensional randomly rough surfaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4774812","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical simulation of scattering from three-dimensional randomly rough surfaces","sourcePdf":"00312887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03647S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"70","articleId":"312887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312890,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Sen Lee","affiliation":["The Remote Sensing Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"lastName":"Jong-Sen Lee","id":"37280313000"},{"name":"K.W.

By introducing a cubic phase term in the chirp scaling phase, data acquired with a squint angle up to 30/spl deg/ can be processed with no degradation of the impulse response function. The proposed approach is computationally very efficient, since it accommodates the variations of Doppler centroid without using block processing. Furthermore, a motion error extraction algorithm can be incorporated into the proposed approach by means of subaperture processing in azimuth. The new approach, denoted as extended chirp scaling, is considered to be a generalized algorithm suitable for the high-resolution processing of most airborne SAR systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7578/00312891.pdf","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.312891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.312891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7578","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Airborne SAR processing of highly squinted data using a chirp scaling approach with integrated motion compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Image coding","Interpolation","Chirp modulation","Pulse modulation","Signal processing","Time domain analysis","Polarization","Frequency modulation","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","motion estimation","geophysics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land surface","terrain mapping","geophysical measurement technique","radar remote sensing","synthetic aperture radar","SAR imaging","data processing","image processing","signal processing","highly squinted data","chirp scaling algorithm","integrated motion compensation","airborne SAR","motion error correction","Doppler centroid","cubic phase term","impulse response function","subaperture processing","extended chirp scaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Airborne SAR processing of highly squinted data using a chirp scaling approach with integrated motion compensation","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774816","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Airborne SAR processing of highly squinted data using a chirp scaling approach with integrated motion compensation","sourcePdf":"00312891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044022S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"292","articleId":"312891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":312896,"authors":[{"name":"L.E.

The classifier uses L- and C-Band polarimetric SAR measurements of the imaged scene to classify individual pixels into one of four categories: tall vegetation (trees), short vegetation, urban, or bare surface, with the last category encompassing water surfaces, bare soil surfaces, and concrete or asphalt-covered surfaces. The classifier design uses knowledge of the nature of radar backscattering from surfaces and volumes to construct appropriate discriminators in a sequential format. The classifier, which was developed using training areas in a test site in Northern Michigan, was tested against independent test areas in the same test site and in another site imaged three months earlier. Among all cases and all categories, the classification accuracy ranged between 91% and 100%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.312896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7578/00312896.pdf","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.312896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-based classification of polarimetric SAR images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=312896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312896/","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-based classification of polarimetric SAR images","volume":"32","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774821","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-based classification of polarimetric SAR images","sourcePdf":"00312896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037065S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"91","articleId":"312896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":312897,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

Based on the polynomial basis function (PBF) modeled neural network that is a modified multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network, a dynamic learning algorithm (DL) is proposed. The presented learning algorithm makes use of the Kalman filtering technique to update the network weights, in the sense that the stochastic characteristics of incoming data sets are implicitly incorporated into the network. The Kalman gains which represent the learning rates of the network weights updating are calculated by using the U-D factorization. By concatenating all of the network weights at each layer to form a long vector such that it can be updated without propagating back, the proposed algorithm improves the performance of convergence to which the backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm often suffers. Numerical illustrations are carried out using two categories of problems: multispectral imagery classification and surface parameters inversion. Results indicates the use of Kalman filtering algorithm not only substantially increases the convergence rate in the learning stage, but also enhances the separability for highly nonlinear boundaries problems, as compared to BP algorithm, suggesting that the proposed DL neural network provides a practical and potential tool for remote sensing applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.312898","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.312898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7578","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7578/00312898.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic learning neural network for remote sensing applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312898/","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic learning neural network for remote sensing applications","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4774823","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic learning neural network for remote sensing applications","sourcePdf":"00312898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05067S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"48","articleId":"312898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":312899,"authors":[{"name":"T.

First, the authors apply the error backpropagation (BP) algorithm to classify the remote sensing data. In this case, the classification performance depends on a training data set. In order to get stable and precise classification results, the training data set is selected based on geographical information and Kohonen's self-organizing feature map. Using the training data set and the error backpropagation algorithm, a layered neural network is trained such that the training patterns are classified with a specified accuracy. After training the neural network, some pixels are deleted from the original training data set if they are incorrectly classified and a new training data set is built up. Once training is complete, a testing data set is classified by using the trained neural network. The classification results of LANDSAT TM data show that this approach produces excellent results which are more realistic and noiseless compared with a conventional Bayesian method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.312899","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7578/00312899.pdf","startPage":"1103","endPage":"1109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.312899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network approach to land cover mapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network approach to land cover mapping","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4774824","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approach to land cover mapping","sourcePdf":"00312899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037043S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"69","articleId":"312899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":312902,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Previous work has resulted in a blackboard-based system, employing a mixture of image-, signal-, and rule-based processing to extract appropriate feature information from sonar scans. We here describe a system capable of carrying out classifications of observed objects based on available feature measures, such as size, shape, and gray level characteristics. The problem of determining feature measures which are invariant to changes in sonar setting, object position/orientation, and noise characteristics is addressed by using qualitative measures to describe object features during matching for recognition. Invariance comes from dynamically selecting the threshold values used to map the numerical feature values derived from the image data to these qualitative measures. Descriptions of the qualitative appearance of known objects are maintained as \"exemplars.\" Recognition therefore takes place by matching observed object descriptions to exemplars in either a constrained or unconstrained fashion. Descriptions are presented for the feature measures used, the quantitative-to-qualitative mapping, and the matching procedures, with results showing the discrimination provided by the feature measures, the changing numerical boundary values between qualitative attributes, and the overall success of the recognition processing for single sonar scans. The overall interpretation is shown to be 86% successful for objects viewed on different sonars in different conditions, provided features measures giving good discrimination between objects are employed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/312915/","volume":"19","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4786990","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic interpretation of sonar imagery using qualitative feature matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic interpretation of sonar imagery using qualitative feature matching","sourcePdf":"00312915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051537S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"31","articleId":"312915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":313011,"authors":[{"name":"B.N.

The authors focus on the communication issues of disseminating information from an active map server to its clients, and in particular, address how to deal with various overload situations that can occur. Simple unicast callbacks to interested clients work well enough if only a few located-objects are moving at any given time and only a few clients wish to know about any given move. However, if many people are moving about in the same region and many clients are interested in their motion, then the AMS may experience overload due to the quadratic nature of the communications involved. This overload affects both the server as well as any slow communications links being used. Mobile distributed computing enables users to interact with many different mobile and stationary computers over the course of the day.

In many robotic tasks the manipulator in contact cannot be simply modeled as a kinematically constrained system. Conversely, modeling of robot-environment interactions through dynamic impedance may not fit the task layout. A suitable model structure is proposed in this note that handles the more general case in which purely kinematic constraints on the robot end-effector live together with dynamic interactions. Feasible end-effector configurations are parameterized from the environment point of view, using a minimal set of coordinates. Accordingly, a description is obtained also for admissible velocities and contact forces. In particular, a force parameterization is chosen so as to separate static reaction forces from active forces responsible for energy transfer between robot and environment. The overall dynamics of the coupled robot-environment system is obtained in a single framework. The introduced modeling technique naturally leads to the design of new hybrid control laws.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/313104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4757492","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of robots in contact with a dynamic environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of robots in contact with a dynamic environment","sourcePdf":"00313104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032208S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"54","articleId":"313104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":313105,"authors":[{"name":"Hanqi Zhuang","affiliation":["Robotics Center and Department of Electrical Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Hanqi Zhuang","id":"37087145227"},{"name":"Z.S.

The flange frame is defined on the mounting surface of the end-effector. It is assumed that the robot geometry, i.e., the transformation from the robot base frame to the robot flange frame, is known with sufficient accuracy, and that robot end-effector poses are measured. The solution has applications to accurately locating a robot with respect to a reference frame, and a robot sensor with respect to a robot end-effector. The identification problem is cast as solving a system of homogeneous transformation equations of the form A/sub i/X=YB/sub i/,i=1, 2, ..., m. Quaternion algebra is applied to derive explicit linear solutions for X and Y provided that three robot pose measurements are available. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the solution are stated.

An efficient formulation of tree search on an SIMD machine consists of two major components: a triggering mechanism, which determines when the search space redistribution must occur to balance the search space over processors, and a scheme to redistribute the search space. We have devised a new redistribution mechanism and a new triggering mechanism. Either of these can be used in conjunction with triggering and redistribution mechanisms developed by other researchers. We analyze the scalability of these mechanisms and verify the results experimentally. The analysis and experiments show that our new load-balancing methods are highly scalable on SIMD architectures. Their scalability is shown to he no worse than that of the best load-balancing schemes on MIMD architectures.

The other three require some type of hardware modification to guarantee the constant geometry of the successive doubling method. We have defined a generalized processing section (PS), based on a circular CORDIC rotator, for the four transforms. This PS section permits the evaluation of the CFFT and FCT transforms in n data recirculations and the RFFT and FHT transforms in n-1 data recirculations, with n being the number of stages of a transform of length N=r/sup n/. Also, the efficiency of the partitioned parallel architecture is optimum because there is no cycle loss in the systolic computation of all the butterflies for each of the four transforms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.313124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.313124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/7586/00313124.pdf","startPage":"1091","endPage":"1099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel architecture for fast transforms with trigonometric kernel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/313124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Parallel architecture for fast transforms with trigonometric kernel","volume":"5","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4782658","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel architecture for fast transforms with trigonometric kernel","sourcePdf":"00313124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043944S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"9","articleId":"313124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":313127,"authors":[{"name":"D.-C.R.

These 3D LCR prototype filters can be used to design 3D recursive filters for the processing of image sequences involving 3D spatio-temporal-domain linear-trajectory (LT) and planar-wave (PW) component signals. Among the new proposed filters, a 3D planar-rejection (PR) filter can be used to reject an undesired spatially-varying or spatially-static background LT component signal; a 3D planar-pass/planar-rejection (PP-PR) filter can be tuned to enhance a desired 3D LT component signal and, at the same time, reject an undesired 3D LT component signal. A technique for implementing the 3D filter transfer functions is proposed that employs 3D differential or 3D integral operators, leading to highly-parallel and modular 3D recursive filter structures that are efficient in computation.

Using this mathematical structure, they derive a low-resolution decoder that has the theoretically minimum possible drift, and propose techniques for implementation that produce substantial improvement in real sequences. The minimum drift can also be used as a milestone, to be compared with other techniques of drift reduction (of worse performance but lower complexity). For the case where leakage is used to reduce the drift, the authors determine a minimum-energy non-uniform DCT-domain leakage matrix which is no more complex than uniform leakage, but gives a substantial improvement. Finally, they note that DCT-based pyramidal coding is essentially the same as the drift case, and thus they use the same mathematical structure to derive the theoretically-best upward predictor in pyramidal coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.313134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7587","startPage":"392","endPage":"406","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7587/00313134.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal error drift in frequency scalability for motion-compensated DCT coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/313134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Minimal error drift in frequency scalability for motion-compensated DCT coding","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4776250","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal error drift in frequency scalability for motion-compensated DCT coding","sourcePdf":"00313134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033429S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"20","articleId":"313134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":313135,"authors":[{"name":"Her-Ming Jong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Her-Ming Jong","id":"37354884000"},{"name":"Liang-Gee","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

However, TSS uses a uniformly allocated checking point pattern in its first step, which becomes inefficient for the estimation of small motions. A new three-step search (NTSS) algorithm is proposed in the paper. The features of NTSS are that it employs a center-biased checking point pattern in the first step, which is derived by making the search adaptive to the motion vector distribution, and a halfway-stop technique to reduce the computation cost. Simulation results show that, as compared to TSS, NTSS is much more robust, produces smaller motion compensation errors, and has a very compatible computational complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.313138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.313138","endPage":"442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7587/00313138.pdf","startPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new three-step search algorithm for block motion estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/313138/","displayDocTitle":"A new three-step search algorithm for block motion estimation","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4776253","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new three-step search algorithm for block motion estimation","sourcePdf":"00313138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070404S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"1094","articleId":"313138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":313148,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Rules were developed and tested for tailoring template walking stimulation patterns to individuals. The criteria for effective rule application were based on the degree to which the paraplegic gait approached normal appearance, independence of forward progression, the least amount of upper body support, and the minimum amount of energy used as perceived by the user. The ability of preset microprocessor-controlled stimuli to generate walking in paraplegia were limited by muscle strength, fatigue, and timing of stimulation. Joint moment testing showed that paraplegic subjects had 20-60% of normal strength. In individuals at the lower end of the range, the strength was insufficient to allow independent forward progression. The muscle fatigue effected the strength and timing of joint movements during walking. Timing of hip extensor activation at heel strike was found to be critical for progression. Excessive forces were taken up through arm support, especially with hip and trunk extensor fatigue, and forward lean was essential for progression. Hip and trunk stability was achieved through stiffening by co-contraction and upper body support. This resulted in metabolic energy expenditure as high as four times normal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/7588/00313148.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/86.313148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.313148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=313148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of paraplegic gait with multichannel functional neuromuscular stimulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neuromuscular stimulation","Muscles","Legged locomotion","Injuries","Electrodes","Fatigue","Timing","Hip","Testing","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","muscle","neurophysiology","orthotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["paraplegic gait synthesis","multichannel functional neuromuscular stimulation","template stimulation patterns","walking","normal appearance","forward progression independence","upper body support minimization","energy use minimization","muscle strength","muscle fatigue","stimulation timing","hip extensor activation timing","heel strike","arm support","trunk extensor fatigue","hip extensor fatigue","forward lean","stability","metabolic energy expenditure","preset microprocessor-controlled stimuli"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/313148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of paraplegic gait with multichannel functional neuromuscular stimulation","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4777303","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of paraplegic gait with multichannel functional neuromuscular stimulation","sourcePdf":"00313148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054789S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"111","articleId":"313148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":313299,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The FISR utilizes the scan-in-scan-out design inject faults to the internal circuits of a VLSI chip. The fault injection is accomplished by loading a pair of fault vectors to a set of fault latches via the scan registers. The fault latches are then enabled so that the target signals will be forced to high or low during the normal operation. the delivery of injected faults via the scan registers and the concept of fault vector are the major innovations in the design. An innovative three stage flip-flop is also used to reduce the implementation overhead of the FISR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/313299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4503703","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault injection scan design for enhanced VLSI design verification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault injection scan design for enhanced VLSI design verification","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00313299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034786S","chronDate":"6-8 April 1993","isNumber":"7592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"464","citationCount":"2","articleId":"313299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":313302,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The authors have already introduced a former method using neural logic gate to be mapped into real circuits directly, although the method needs a large number of neurons. In order to reduce the total number of neurons and computing cost, they propose a neural function called NIF, neural inverse function, for ATPG, automatic test pattern generation. A NIF is defined as a Boolean product form of sums. Simulation results of n-bit full-adder circuits show that the computational order of ATPG is approximately O(n/sup 0.5/) in parallel convergence, and O(n/sup 0.9/) in sequential. Compared with the former method, the new method is able to find a set of test patterns about n times faster than the former method, because NIF method needs a small amount of neurons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1993.313318","startPage":"238","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"Digest of Papers Eleventh Annual 1993 IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTEST.1993.313318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7592","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Papers Eleventh Annual 1993 IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/464/7592/00313318.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural inverse function for automatic test pattern generation using strictly digital neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/313318/","displayDocTitle":"A neural inverse function for automatic test pattern generation using strictly digital neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4494100","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural inverse function for automatic test pattern generation using strictly digital neural networks","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00313318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057521S","chronDate":"6-8 April 1993","isNumber":"7592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"464","articleId":"313318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":313414,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

This paper traces the evolution of operational amplifier designs since vacuum tube days to give a perspective of the large number of circuit variations used over time. Of particular value is the ability to use many of these circuit design options as the basis of new amplifiers. In addition, an array of operational amplifier components fabricated on the AT&T CBIC V2 process is described. This design incorporates many of the architectural techniques that have evolved over the years to produce four separate operational amplifier on a single base wafer. The process design methodology requires identifying the common elements in each architecture and the minimum number of additional components required to implement four unique architectures on the array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Bipolar transistors","Power amplifiers","Bandwidth","Circuit noise","Rate distortion theory","Electron tubes","Circuit synthesis","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","wideband amplifiers","bipolar integrated circuits","linear integrated circuits","electric distortion","noise","feedback","differential amplifiers","reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed op amp architectures","operational amplifier","wide-bandwidth type","bipolar transistor opamps","slew rate","noise","distortion","power","AT&T CBIC V2 process","array configuration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.315199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7604/00315199.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.315199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution of high-speed operational amplifier architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evolution of high-speed operational amplifier architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315199/","volume":"29","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4797331","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of high-speed operational amplifier architectures","sourcePdf":"00315199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038745S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"57","articleId":"315199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":315200,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Simple guard ring substrate contacts appear to be the technique best suited for preventing cross-talk at high operating frequencies. Lumped parameter equivalent circuits have also been developed to represent different isolation schemes in SPICE. The isolation characteristics of test structures employing the above techniques are computed using SPICE and the results compared with two-dimensional device simulation.

The broadband pre-amplifier is required to reduce the inherently noisy differential cascode stage, and an output differential amplifier is used to provide output drive capability and differential to single-ended conversion. The VGA has a maximum gain of 23.8 dB gain, an IP3>18 dBm, and a noise figure of 6.5 dB. The variable gain control range is >35 dB.

The scheme operates by feeding back a fraction of the error current to the storage node whose voltage is adjusted so that the error is reduced to zero. Using the feedback compensation scheme, absolute current error of less than 0.1% was achieved even at ultra-low current levels of 10 nA. The negative feedback circuit consumes negligibly low power and can be laid in a very small area. With this scheme, memory accuracy is traded for error correction speed, a feature common to all feedback-based switch feedthrough reduction schemes.

The motor is a polyphase multipole square-wave PM motor, which can be classified as a kind of PM brushless DC motor. The distinct features of the proposed motor as compared to those of the conventional PM brushless DC motor are as follows. First, the multipole magnetic circuit arrangement enables the minimization of the magnetic yoke, resulting in the reduction of motor volume and weight. Second, the coil span is purposely designed to be equal to one slot pitch, thus saving the amount of copper used. Third, by using a fractional number of slots per pole per phase, the arrangement of the numbers of poles and slots is so unique that the magnetic force between the stator and the rotor at any rotating position is uniform, hence eliminating the cogging torque that usually occurs in PM motors. Finally, the motor can be controlled to operate at a constant torque region and a constant power region with field weakening, thus both high starting torque and high cruising speed can be achieved. Therefore, as the proposed motor drive possesses the distinct advantages of high power density, high efficiency, and superior dynamic performance, it is very suitable for EV applications. A prototype of a five-phase 22-pole 5 kW motor drive has been designed for an experimental EV.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/7605/00315237.pdf","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.315237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.315237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel polyphase multipole square-wave permanent magnet motor drive for electric vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Brushless DC motors","DC motors","Motor drives","Brushless motors","Electric vehicles","Magnetic circuits","Minimization","Coils","Copper"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","electric drives","electric vehicles","stators","rotors","magnetic circuits","machine theory","machine testing","electromagnetic fields","equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyphase multipole square-wave permanent magnet motor drive","electric vehicles","PM brushless DC motor","multipole magnetic circuit","magnetic yoke","volume","weight","coil span","slots","pole","magnetic force","stator","rotor","field weakening","starting torque","cruising speed","power density","efficiency","dynamic performance","applications","design","5 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A novel polyphase multipole square-wave permanent magnet motor drive for electric vehicles","volume":"30","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4786874","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel polyphase multipole square-wave permanent magnet motor drive for electric vehicles","sourcePdf":"00315237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052642S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1994","isNumber":"7605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"78","articleId":"315237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":315267,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Sheng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Power Mechanical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Sheng Lu","id":"37351093800"},{"name":"Jian-Shiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Power Mechanical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jian-Shiang Chen","id":"37351173400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"315267","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Sliding mode control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Fuzzy systems","Stability analysis","Guidelines","Magnetic levitation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic levitation","nonlinear control systems","fuzzy control","stability","variable structure systems","self-adjusting systems","position control","controllers","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing fuzzy sliding-mode controller","nonlinear servo systems","tracking control","chatter","stability analysis","magnetic levitation system","robust performance"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-organizing fuzzy sliding-mode controller design for a class of nonlinear servo systems","doi":"10.1109/41.315267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7606/00315267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.315267","startPage":"492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315267","abstract":"A self-organizing fuzzy controller to augment a sliding-mode control (SOFSMC) scheme for a class of nonlinear systems is proposed.

The chatter encountered by most sliding-mode control schemes is greatly alleviated without sacrificing invariant properties. A stability analysis is presented; the design guidelines and the class of applicable systems are clearly identified. To verify the scheme, the authors performed experiments on its implementation in a magnetic levitation system.

It consists of two phases: preprocessing and sorting. In the preprocessing phase, input data are randomly placed on a square grid and sorted in column-wise order followed by row-wise order using heapsort. In the sorting phase, the preprocessed data are treated as a linear list and sorted by a modified quicksort. The sort time complexity of the hybrid method is O(n log/sub 2/n), and maintains a fairly constant value for a fixed n for any presortedness of the input data. The granularity of parallelism in the hybidsort is large, and therefore it is suitable for parallel processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00315403.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCI'93: 5th International Conference on Computing and Information","pdfPath":"/iel2/923/7608/00315403.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICCI'93: 5th International Conference on Computing and Information","doi":"10.1109/ICCI.1993.315403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCI.1993.315403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An O(n log/sub 2/n) hybrid sorting algorithm on 2-D grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Scattering","Hypercubes","Parallel processing","Runtime","Stability","Data preprocessing","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting","computational complexity","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid sorting algorithm","2D grid structure","heapsort","modified quicksort","preprocessing phase","randomly placed input data","square grid","column-wise order","row-wise order","linear list","sort time complexity","input data presortedness","parallelism granularity","parallel processing","internal sorting","hybridsort"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"An O(n log/sub 2/n) hybrid sorting algorithm on 2-D grid","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4725725","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An O(n log/sub 2/n) hybrid sorting algorithm on 2-D grid","confLoc":"Sudbury, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00315403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032864S","chronDate":"27-29 May 1993","isNumber":"7608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"923","articleId":"315403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":315591,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Unfortunately, the development of these systems, unlike conventional software systems, is hardware-intensive, requiring significant hardware development time. One way to introduce a more flexible development approach is to implement a customizable stored-program processor. For a given application, the designer can develop customized hardware to increase performance and then control the sequencing and operation of this hardware with software. Development time can be significantly reduced because conventional software development tools, e.g. assemblers and compilers, can be used to quickly develop new applications on the customized processor. This paper presents the Nano Processor, a fully customizable reconfigurable processor, together with its integrated assembler, that has been successfully implemented on the Xilinx 3000 series field programmable gate array (FPGA).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1994.315595","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel2/949/7612/00315595.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1994.315595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Nano Processor: a low resource reconfigurable processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315595/","displayDocTitle":"The Nano Processor: a low resource reconfigurable processor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4754543","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Nano Processor: a low resource reconfigurable processor","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00315595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044398S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"949","citationCount":"36","articleId":"315595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":315596,"authors":[{"name":"A.

During this time frame, large reconfigurable logic arrays have exploited the same advances in IC fabrication technology to emerge as viable system building blocks. Looking at both the technology prospects and application requirements, there is compelling evidence that microprocessors with integrated reconfigurable logic arrays will be a primary building block for future computing systems. In this paper, we look at the role such components can play in building high-performance and economical systems, as well as the ripe technological outlook. We note how the tight integration of reconfigurable logic into the processor can overcome some of the major limitations of contemporary attached reconfigurable computer engines. We specifically consider the use of integrated dynamically programmable gate array (DPGA) structures for the configurable logic, and examine the advantages that rapid reconfiguration provides in this application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1994.315596","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel2/949/7612/00315596.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1994.315596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DPGA-coupled microprocessors: commodity ICs for the early 21st Century","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315596/","displayDocTitle":"DPGA-coupled microprocessors: commodity ICs for the early 21st Century","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4754544","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DPGA-coupled microprocessors: commodity ICs for the early 21st Century","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00315596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035985S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"949","citationCount":"80","articleId":"315596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":315598,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Cellular automata provide an alternative approach. The large scope of applications of cellular automata (in biology, physics, operational research, sociology, computer science and so on) will surely increase the need of such a tool. The basic constitutive cells are discrete and ideally suited to simulation by digital computers. Their property of only interacting in a local environment naturally leads to a new idea of processing: cellular processing. In fact, the simulation of cellular automata with mainframe computers, even with parallel multiprocessors, is always slowed down by the input/output bottleneck. This paper describes the architecture of a compact accelerator for cellular automata. This multi-expandable machine is based on a pipeline architecture which concurrently performs computations and displays results. The underlying principle is to spy on the display bus by grabbing the data flow pouring out to the display device and simultaneously to evaluate the state of each automaton in the network. The performance of the machine reaches the video rate: it computes and displays the state of the 1024/spl times/1024 16-bit automata 24 times per second. FPGAs play a key role in the architecture of the system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4754548","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"CAFCA (Compact Accelerator For Cellular Automata): the metamorphosable machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAFCA (Compact Accelerator For Cellular Automata): the metamorphosable machine","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00315601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040793S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"949","citationCount":"2","articleId":"315601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":315602,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

These programs are then profiled to determine which parts of the code make the most intense use of the processor. These parts are then compiled to the gate level and implemented in the coprocessor. Speedups in program execution time of about 20 are obtained by this method by comparison with an IPC Sparcstation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel2/949/7612/00315607.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"154","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1994.315607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1994.315607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compiling to the gate level for a reconfigurable co-processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Clocks","Computer aided instruction","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture","Frequency","Parallel processing","Hardware","Reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable architectures","logic arrays","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable co-processor","programmable coprocessor","C-compiler","C code","gate level","FPGA","program execution time","IPC Sparcstation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Compiling to the gate level for a reconfigurable co-processor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4754558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compiling to the gate level for a reconfigurable co-processor","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00315607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029157S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"949","citationCount":"10","articleId":"315607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":315608,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The run-time reconfiguration artificial neural network (RRANN) uses ran-time reconfiguration to increase the hardware density of FPGAs. The RRANN architecture also allows large amounts of parallelism to be used and is very scalable. RRANN divides the back-propagation algorithm into three sequential executed stages and configures the FPGAs to execute only one stage at a time. The FPGAs are reconfigured as part of normal execution in order to change stages. Using reconfigurability in this way increases the number of hardware neurons a single Xilinx XC3090 can implement by 500%. Performance is effected by reconfiguration overhead, but this overhead becomes insignificant in large networks. This overhead is made even more insignificant with improved configuration methods. Run-time reconfiguration is a flexible realization of the time/space trade-off. The RRANN architecture has been designed and built using commercially available hardware, and its performance has been measured.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1994.315611","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel2/949/7612/00315611.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1994.315611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Density enhancement of a neural network using FPGAs and run-time reconfiguration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315611/","displayDocTitle":"Density enhancement of a neural network using FPGAs and run-time reconfiguration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","accessionNumber":"4754562","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density enhancement of a neural network using FPGAs and run-time reconfiguration","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00315611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030131S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"949","citationCount":"49","articleId":"315611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":315612,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

However, FPGAs lack the circuit density necessary to implement large parallel ANNs with many thousands of synapses. This paper presents an architecture that makes it feasible to implement large ANNs with FPGAs. The architecture combines stochastic computation techniques with a novel lookup-table-based architecture that fully exploits the lookup-table structure of many FPGAs. This lookup-table-based architecture is extremely efficient: it is capable of supporting up to two synapses per configurable logic block (CLB). In addition, the architecture is simple to implement, self-contained (weights are stored directly in the synapse), and scales easily across multiple chips.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4754563","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based stochastic neural networks-implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based stochastic neural networks-implementation","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00315612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029723S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"949","citationCount":"60","articleId":"315612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":315624,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Tai Chin","affiliation":["Sch. of Comput. & Inf.

The first method is to coerce weights to have low magnitudes during the backpropagation training process, since fault tolerance is degraded by the use of high magnitude weights; at the same time, additional hidden nodes are added dynamically to the network to ensure that desired performance can be obtained. The second method is to add artificial faults to various components (nodes and links) of a network: during training. The third method is to repeatedly remove nodes that do not significantly affect the network: output, and then add new nodes that share the load of the more critical nodes in the network. Experimental results have shown that these methods can obtain better robustness than backpropagation training, and compare favorably with other approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1994.315624","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 24th International Symposium on Fault- Tolerant Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 24th International Symposium on Fault- Tolerant Computing","pdfPath":"/iel2/951/7613/00315624.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTCS.1994.315624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training techniques to obtain fault-tolerant neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315624/","displayDocTitle":"Training techniques to obtain fault-tolerant neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4744904","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training techniques to obtain fault-tolerant neural networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00315624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060731S","chronDate":"15-17 June 1994","isNumber":"7613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"951","citationCount":"4","articleId":"315624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":315626,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Very few multiple bit flips were observed during the experiments which indicates that the single bit flip model used in many high-level simulations is reasonable accurate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1994.315626","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 24th International Symposium on Fault- Tolerant Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 24th International Symposium on Fault- Tolerant Computing","pdfPath":"/iel2/951/7613/00315626.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTCS.1994.315626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On latching probability of particle induced transients in combinational networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315626/","displayDocTitle":"On latching probability of particle induced transients in combinational networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4744902","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On latching probability of particle induced transients in combinational networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00315626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045954S","chronDate":"15-17 June 1994","isNumber":"7613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"951","citationCount":"90","articleId":"315626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":315631,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

A basic algorithm is described that uses two extra processors for checkpointing and enables the system to tolerate any single processor failure. The algorithm's speed comes from a combination of N+1 parity, extra physical memory, and virtual memory hardware so that checkpoints need not be written to disk. This eliminates the most time-consuming portion of checkpointing. The algorithm requires each application processor to allocate a fixed amount of extra memory for checkpointing. This amount may be set statically by the programmer, and need not be equal to the site of the processor's writable address space. This alleviates a major restriction of previous checkpointing algorithms using N+1 parity. Finally, we outline how to extend our algorithm to tolerate any m processor failures with the addition of 2m extra checkpointing processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1994.315631","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 24th International Symposium on Fault- Tolerant Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 24th International Symposium on Fault- Tolerant Computing","pdfPath":"/iel2/951/7613/00315631.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTCS.1994.315631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster checkpointing with N+1 parity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=315631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/315631/","displayDocTitle":"Faster checkpointing with N+1 parity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4744897","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster checkpointing with N+1 parity","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00315631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064754S","chronDate":"15-17 June 1994","isNumber":"7613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"951","citationCount":"50","articleId":"315631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":315638,"authors":[{"name":"U.

In addition, we argue that the hardware overhead for checking can be reduced by approximately one half if a small latency in error detection is acceptable.

SAVE parses an input file and creates a Markov chain model. For small models numerical solution methods can be used, but for larger models (the state space grows exponentially with the number of components in the model), fast simulation techniques using importance sampling have to be used.

This paper presents tables and charts to help the system design engineers address some basic concerns such as the need for harmonic filters, their effect on displacement power factor, etc., without going into a full-scale harmonic analysis of the distribution system. Relative harmonic performance of the different types of drive feeds such as the load commutated inverter (LCI), the current source inverter (CSI) and pulse-width modulated (PWM) drives is discussed. A factor called the harmonic factor is defined which can characterize the performance of a drive by a single number. The relation between harmonic factor and the total harmonic voltage distortion is derived. Attenuation of the harmonic voltages by the filters is calculated and presented in the form of generalized curves. The methods presented in this paper have formed the basis of the design guidelines for distribution systems with large variable frequency drives.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1994.316301","startPage":"909","endPage":"916 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1089/7625/00316301.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1994.316301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application, design and specification of harmonic filters for variable frequency drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic filters","Power harmonic filters","Pulse width modulation inverters","Drives","Frequency","Voltage","Power quality","System analysis and design","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system harmonics","distribution networks","variable speed drives","power factor","invertors","pulse width modulation","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable frequency drives","harmonic filters","application","design","specification","power quality","distribution systems","displacement power factor","harmonic performance","load commutated inverter","current source inverter","pulse-width modulation","harmonic factor","performance","total harmonic voltage distortion","generalized curves","guidelines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application, design and specification of harmonic filters for variable frequency drives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-17 Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4726079","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application, design and specification of harmonic filters for variable frequency drives","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00316301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039133S","chronDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1089","citationCount":"4","articleId":"316301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":316304,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

A current controller in rotating coordinates assures unity input power factor and fast output voltage regulation. Sensitivity of stability margins to different loads is analyzed. Two typical loads, a DC-DC power converter and an inverter supplying an AC motor, are considered. Linear and nonlinear current controllers in the direct axis are compared. With the nonlinear controller, which employs load current feedforward, the rectifier sensitivity to load variations is greatly reduced and a single optimal output voltage compensator can be designed for all load conditions. Small-signal output impedance is significantly improved, and faster transient response is obtained.

It is determined that the common mode emissions predominate the noise level and the spectrum components in this type of system, which result from the derivative of the line to ground voltages at the main circuit (dv/dt) and the circuit parameters, consisting of the physical stray inductance of the main circuit conductors and distributed capacitance formed between the circuit conductors and the grounded chassis/frame, most of which concentrate in motor windings and power-semiconductor devices in this system. Modeling and simulations of the system for purpose of evaluation of EMI are presented. Several strategies suppressing conducted radio-noise emissions are proposed, which are practically feasible for cost-effective EMC designs. Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that high level radio-noise were significantly suppressed and the EMI performance of the system are able to meet the CISPR and FCC limits on conducted emissions for digital devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1994.316342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1994.316342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625","startPage":"608","endPage":"614 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1089/7625/00316342.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=316342","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference","Motor drives","Circuits","Induction motors","Conductors","Pulse width modulation inverters","Noise level","Voltage","Inductance","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","electric drives","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","invertors","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMI performance","inverter-fed motor drives","conducted radio-noise emissions","commercial PWM inverter","induction motor","common mode emissions","line to ground voltages","physical stray inductance","main circuit conductors","distributed capacitance","grounded chassis","grounded frame","motor windings","power-semiconductor devices","modeling","simulations","EMI","EMC designs","digital devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improvements in EMI performance of inverter-fed motor drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Feb. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4726039","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316342/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvements in EMI performance of inverter-fed motor drives","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00316342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028406S","chronDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1089","citationCount":"18","articleId":"316342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":316345,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This paper deals with a new driver circuit that allows optimisation of the switching speed, reduction of the energy losses during the switching time, and limiting of the electromagnetic interference (EMI). Firstly an analysis of voltage and current switching waveforms of gate insulated devices is performed. Hence, it is shown how to control voltage and current slopes independently by using a suitable adaptive driving technique based on a PLL approach. Such a technique has been adapted in order to correctly generate the gate signals regardless of the operating conditions. Finally, practical tests of the proposed driving circuit obtained using a single switch converter and IGBT devices are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1994.316360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1089/7625/00316360.pdf","endPage":"486 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive driving technique for high current gate controlled devices","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1994.316360","startPage":"480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=316360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive driving technique for high current gate controlled devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316360/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4725890","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"13-17 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive driving technique for high current gate controlled devices","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00316360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031608S","chronDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1089","citationCount":"31","articleId":"316360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":316362,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Previous speedup inverter circuits able to provide those higher power levels have been discussed at APEC-92 and APEC-93. They could generate squarewave currents with a constant ramp slope determined by the applied high voltage and the coil inductance. Two new circuit topologies are described here which permit the generation of variable ramp as well as sinusoidal current waveforms for the benefit of pulse sequence designers. The result is a novel high-efficiency quasi-linear power amplifier concept. In one case high-frequency pulse-width modulation schemes are replaced by low-frequency baseband switching. Very good sinusoidal current waveforms (150 A peak, 1150 V) have been obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1089/7625/00316391.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"259 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1994.316391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1994.316391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=316391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-linear IGBT inverter topologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Pulse amplifiers","Pulse width modulation inverters","Circuit topology","Magnetic resonance imaging","Coils","Voltage","Inductance","Pulse generation","Pulse circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","pulse width modulation","insulated gate bipolar transistors","switching circuits","function generators","power amplifiers","biomedical NMR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-linear IGBT inverter","magnetic resonance imaging","gradient coil currents","ramp times","speedup inverter circuits","squarewave currents","ramp slope","high voltage","coil inductance","sinusoidal current waveforms","pulse sequence","power amplifiers","LF baseband switching","HF PWM","150 A","1150 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-linear IGBT inverter topologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4725859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-17 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-linear IGBT inverter topologies","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00316391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063419S","chronDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1089","citationCount":"40","articleId":"316391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":316396,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The proposed scheme employs a single-phase voltage-source half-bridge inverter and a third-order T-filter. The stability of the proposed scheme is first investigated, using the state-space averaging technique and root-locus method, in order to select appropriate feedback control variables that produce stable feedback operation. Secondly, based on the results of the stability analysis, both the capacitor current and voltage are employed in inner and outer feedback control loops respectively, in order to achieve stable operation of the proposed technique and to ensure sinusoidal load voltage and current in the power circuit. Thirdly, computer simulation results of the proposed utility interface system for operation of the power circuit from 'cold' start to full load is presented. It is shown that the proposed control scheme offers improved performance for utility interface applications. It is simple to implement, and capable of producing nearly perfect sinusoidal line current and voltage waveforms at any desired power factor with moderate switching frequency and reasonable size of filter parameters. Furthermore, it is compatible with both weak and large AC networks. Finally, experimental verification of the operation of the proposed scheme at various load power factors is provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1994.316414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625","startPage":"93","endPage":"99 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel2/1089/7625/00316414.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1994.316414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A single-phase voltage-source utility interface system for weak AC network applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","Reactive power","Voltage control","Electric variables control","Control systems","Power industry","Inverters","State feedback","Stability analysis","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system interconnection","power system control","invertors","voltage control","electric current control","power system stability","feedback","power system analysis computing","control system analysis computing","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-phase","half-bridge","VSI","electric utility interface","third-order T-filter","stability","state-space averaging","root-locus method","feedback control variables","computer simulation","performance","power factor","switching frequency","interconnection","voltage control","current control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"A single-phase voltage-source utility interface system for weak AC network applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316414/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4725836","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"13-17 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A single-phase voltage-source utility interface system for weak AC network applications","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00316414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023901S","chronDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1089","citationCount":"17","articleId":"316414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":316420,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

The control strategy is to vary the duty cycle of the applied DC-voltage in order to obtain the desired speed quickly and when operating in steady-state vary the turn-on angle (/spl alphasub on/) of the phase-voltage to minimize the energy consumption. The power flow is measured in the DC-link and used to control the turn-on angle. Simulations carried out on a 6/4 pole SRM justify the algorithm and the physical implementation in a Siemens SAB 80C517A microcontroller is described. Measurements on two different load systems show it is possible to minimize the energy consumption on-line in a speed controlled switched reluctance motor without losing the dynamic performance. A comparison with an ordinary mode-shift controlled SRM shows more than 8% increase in overall efficiency for some operation points. The algorithm is fully applicable to other switched reluctance motors at other power levels or with other pole configurations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Energy consumption","Reluctance machines","Steady-state","Load flow","Power measurement","Fluid flow measurement","Microcontrollers","Energy measurement","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reluctance motors","power consumption","energy conservation","machine control","power control","microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy optimizing control strategy","switched reluctance motors","speed controlled switched reluctance motor","duty cycle","applied DC-voltage","steady-state operation","turn-on angle","phase-voltage","DC-link","6/4 pole SRM","Siemens SAB 80C517A microcontroller","load systems"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1994.316420","startPage":"48","endPage":"55 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1089/7625/00316420.pdf","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1994.316420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new energy optimizing control strategy for switched reluctance motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new energy optimizing control strategy for switched reluctance motors","accessionNumber":"4725830","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new energy optimizing control strategy for switched reluctance motors","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00316420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040139S","chronDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1089","citationCount":"13","articleId":"316420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":316422,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The ballast consists of an integrated, single stage power factor corrected rectifier, and a half-bridge high-frequency resonant inverter to interface the lamp with the DC bus. PWM control of the single stage rectifier produces sinusoidal input current at unity input power factor. The lamp is referenced to the supply neutral, without ohmic isolation, which is an important safety feature. To prevent acoustic resonance, a commonly encountered problem in high-frequency operation, the inverter is driven by a frequency modulated PWM strategy. The choices of the carrier frequency, the frequency modulation range, and the modulation sweep frequency are functions of selected lamp type. The proposed ballast is analyzed, simulated and experimentally verified with a 250 W metal halide lamp.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1994.316422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1994.316422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625","startPage":"31","endPage":"37 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1089/7625/00316422.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - ASPEC'94","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=316422","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Electronic ballasts","High intensity discharge lamps","Frequency modulation","Rectifiers","Resonant inverters","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Safety","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metal vapour lamps","lamp accessories","light sources","power factor correction","rectifiers","invertors","pulse width modulation","rectifying circuits","bridge circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unity power factor","electronic ballast","metal halide lamps","high-frequency electronic ballast","high-intensity discharge lamps","single stage power factor corrected rectifier","half-bridge high-frequency resonant inverter","DC bus","PWM control","sinusoidal input current","supply neutral","safety","frequency modulated PWM strategy","carrier frequency","frequency modulation range","modulation sweep frequency","250 W"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A unity power factor electronic ballast for metal halide lamps","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Feb. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4725828","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316422/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unity power factor electronic ballast for metal halide lamps","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00316422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028746S","chronDate":"13-17 Feb 1994","isNumber":"7625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1089","citationCount":"34","articleId":"316422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":316424,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Since multiple-access noise is the sum of many independent random processes, it is reasonable to approximate it by a Gaussian process of the same power spectral density. This leads to the criterion of maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, receivers that maximize SNR in a particular DS-CDMA system model under various constraints are proposed and analyzed. The method proposed here does not require locking and despreading multiple arriving CDMA signals. The performance of the system is analyzed when the receiver is constrained to operate bit-by-bit, in the absence of knowledge of the other users' spreading codes, timing, and phase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NTC.1994.316660","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE National Telesystems Conference - NTC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE National Telesystems Conference - NTC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1118/7628/00316660.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTC.1994.316660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A noise-whitening approach to multiple-access noise rejection in a CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=316660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/316660/","displayDocTitle":"A noise-whitening approach to multiple-access noise rejection in a CDMA system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4740641","conferenceDate":"26-28 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A noise-whitening approach to multiple-access noise rejection in a CDMA system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00316660.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029402S","chronDate":"26-28 May 1994","isNumber":"7628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1118","citationCount":"1","articleId":"316660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":316686,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.

Because the radio link is direct to each subscriber, the prediction of signal characteristics is most important in urban areas where subscriber density is high, and the buildings have a profound influence on the propagation. The paper starts by reviewing the characteristic signal variations observed in CMR systems employing high base station antennas to cover macrocells having radius out to 20 km. Theoretical models incorporating diffraction are shown to explain the observed range dependence and shadow loss statistics. For the low base station antennas envisioned to cover microcells of radius out to 1 km for PCS applications, signal propagation is more strongly dependent on the building environment and on the location of the antennas in relation to the buildings. Various levels of theoretical modeling of this dependence are discussed in conjunction with measurements made in various building environments. Finally, the paper discusses advances in site specific prediction for outdoor and indoor propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.317081","doi":"10.1109/5.317081","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7642/00317081.pdf","startPage":"1333","endPage":"1359","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00317081.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UHF propagation prediction for wireless personal communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"UHF propagation prediction for wireless personal communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"82","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4776417","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UHF propagation prediction for wireless personal communications","sourcePdf":"00317081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135557S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"207","articleId":"317081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317082,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The importance of understanding the nature of the traffic to be carried by the network is emphasized. After some discussion of multiple access options for steady traffic and for slowly varying traffic, the use of random-access protocols for rapidly varying traffic is explained. Two general random-access protocols have been used in a variety of data networks, ALOHA and CDMA. Although these two techniques have different origins and are generally thought of as separate, they are in fact but different ways of looking at the same basic signals. The author shows that the use of multiple spreading codes in a CDMA network is not necessary in order to achieve multiple access capability. A single code can greatly reduce the complexity of a CDMA system. He introduces a spread-spectrum version of an ALOHA channel (spread ALOHA) which is equivalent to a CDMA channel with a common spreading code for all users. The equivalence the author demonstrates opens the door to a variety of techniques commonly used in ALOHA channels which can significantly increase both the throughput and the efficiency of the spread-spectrum channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00317082.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7642/00317082.pdf","startPage":"1360","endPage":"1370","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.317082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.317082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple access in wireless digital networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Multiaccess communication","Radio transmitters","Telecommunication traffic","Spread spectrum communication","Satellite broadcasting","Access protocols","Packet radio networks","Artificial satellites","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","code division multiple access","digital radio systems","packet radio networks","telecommunication traffic","encoding","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication channels","channel capacity","data communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless digital networks","multiple-access system","hub station","traffic","multiple access","random-access protocols","ALOHA","CDMA","multiple spreading codes","complexity","spread-spectrum","spread ALOHA","throughput","efficiency","spread-spectrum channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Multiple access in wireless digital networks","volume":"82","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4776418","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple access in wireless digital networks","sourcePdf":"00317082.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028304S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"134","articleId":"317082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":317083,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

The author reviews the important traffic performance measures for cellular systems and the issues of channel assignment, handoff, access control, traffic modeling, and traffic management. Traffic modeling for all types of networks is considered in some depth, both by drawing analogies with fixed-wire networks, and by considering cellular-specific modeling. From the modeling results, he concludes that reuse-based networks such as FDMA and TDMA possess quite different traffic characteristics from CDMA networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.317083","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1371","endPage":"1382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.317083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7642","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7642/00317083.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system traffic control","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Frequency division multiaccess","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Cellular networks","Paper technology","Bit error rate","Access control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","time division multiple access","code division multiple access","telecommunication traffic","telecommunication network management","cellular radio","reviews","frequency allocation","mobile radio systems","digital radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio interface","cellular mobile networks","traffic-related issues","FDMA","TDMA","CDMA","traffic performance","cellular systems","channel assignment","handoff","access control","traffic modeling","traffic management","reuse-based networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Traffic engineering of the radio interface for cellular mobile networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317083/","volume":"82","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4776419","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic engineering of the radio interface for cellular mobile networks","sourcePdf":"00317083.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052138S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"73","articleId":"317083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":317084,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

New calls and handoff calls enter at both the microcell and macrocell levels. Handoff calls are given priority access to channels at each level. The layout has inherent load-balancing capability, so spatial teletraffic variations are accommodated without the need for elaborate coordination of base stations (wireless gateways). An analytical model for teletraffic performance (including handoff) is developed.

While the wireless data industry is becoming increasingly diverse and fragmented, one can identify a few mainstreams which relate directly to users requirement for data services. On one hand, there are requirements for relatively low-speed data services supporting mobile users over wide geographical areas, as provided by mobile data networks. On the other hand, there are requirements for high-speed data services in local areas, as provided by wireless LANs. The system-level issues are somewhat different for these two categories of services, and this has led to different technology choices in the two domains, which the authors discuss in the paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4776421","volume":"82","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wireless data communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless data communications","sourcePdf":"00317085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115499S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"133","articleId":"317085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317086,"authors":[{"name":"W.W.

In this note, the author develops a supervisory controller for a nonlinear fuzzy control systems. The supervisory controller works in the following way: if the fuzzy control system (without the supervisory controller) is stable in the sense that the state is inside the constraint set, the supervisory control is idle; if the state hits the boundary of the constraint set, the supervisory controller begins operation to force the state back to the constraint set. The author proves that the fuzzy control system equipped with this supervisory controller is globally stable in the sense that the state is guaranteed to be within the constraint set specified by the system designer. The author also proposes schemes by continuously switching between supervisory and nonsupervisory modes. Finally, the author applies a fuzzy controller with the supervisory controller to the inverted pendulum balancing problem where it is required that the state variables must be within a fixed bound.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.317109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7643/00317109.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.317109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7643","startPage":"1845","endPage":"1847","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00317109.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A supervisory controller for fuzzy control systems that guarantees stability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A supervisory controller for fuzzy control systems that guarantees stability","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4786702","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A supervisory controller for fuzzy control systems that guarantees stability","sourcePdf":"00317109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025544S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"74","articleId":"317109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317119,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Yeu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shin-Yeu Lin","id":"37334450500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"317119","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"We present a two-phase parallel computing method for obtaining an implementable receding horizon control solution for constrained nonlinear systems.

Specifically, it is shown that an algorithm designed to reject a certain number of frequency components may in fact be capable of reducing higher-order harmonics as well. This effect originates in the time-variation of the adaptive parameters. A consequence is that the adaptive system may perform better than the algorithm with the fixed, ideal parameters. Surprisingly, the response to higher-order harmonics can be calculated precisely, using a Laplace transform analysis. The origin of the numerical procedure is in the equivalence between the adaptive feedforward cancellation scheme and a control scheme based on the internal model principle.

A computationally efficient sequence detection algorithm is proposed which yields a performance close to that of the maximum likelihood sequence detector when applied to such ISI channels. The proposed detector is derived as a high signal-to-noise ratio approximation to the delay-constrained optimum detector, one which minimizes the symbol error probability given a fixed decision-delay constraint. The proposed algorithm is essentially a fixed-delay tree search (FDTS) algorithm with systematic ambiguity checking and is closely related to existing finite-depth tree search algorithms. It is observed that long critical error events common in uncoded ISI channels are eliminated by the RLL constraint. Based on this observation, we show that for some important RLL constrained channels, the proposed FDTS algorithm yields the same minimum Euclidean distance between distinguishable channel output sequences as the unconstrained maximum likelihood sequence detector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.317401","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"2654","endPage":"2660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7647/00317401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.317401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient sequence detection for intersymbol interference channels with run-length constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intersymbol interference","Maximum likelihood detection","Detectors","Modulation coding","Interference constraints","Memory","Communication channels","Detection algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","intersymbol interference","telecommunication channels","modulation","probability","error statistics","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-noise ratio approximation","intersymbol interference channels","run-length constraints","data detection","ISI channels","modulation code-constraint","data storage channels","communication channels","sequence detection algorithm","delay-constrained optimum detector","symbol error probability","fixed-delay tree search algorithm","finite-depth tree search algorithms","minimum Euclidean distance","channel output sequences","unconstrained maximum likelihood sequence detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Efficient sequence detection for intersymbol interference channels with run-length constraints","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4797507","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317401/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient sequence detection for intersymbol interference channels with run-length constraints","sourcePdf":"00317401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070666S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","articleId":"317401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":317406,"authors":[{"name":"P.F.

A unified analytic method that is suitable for vertical, directional, or horizontal wells is presented. Attenuation properties are examined for various parameters, including the Earth's conductivity, operating frequency and the length of the drill string. The frequency dependence of the receivability in reference to a noise level is illustrated for different depths of well and different cases. It is also demonstrated that the electric field distributions at the surface have the same features for the three types of well, and that the measurements should be carried out near the well heads for any type of well.

The three techniques are the reference channel method, the emissivity normalization method, and the alpha emissivity method. The methods used to recover the temperature of artificial radiance derived from a wide variety of materials. The results indicate that the emissivity normalization and alpha emissivity techniques are the most accurate, and recover the temperature of the majority of the artificial radiance spectra to within 1.5 K; the reference channel method produces less accurate results. The primary advantage of the alpha emissivity method over the emissivity normalization method is that it works well in terrains of widely varying emissivities, e.g.,those dominated by vegetation and igneous rocks. By contrast, the emissivity normalization method works well only if the emissivity used for normalization is close to the maximum emissivity of the spectra in the scene.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.317447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7649/00317447.pdf","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1164","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00317447.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.317447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separating temperature and emissivity in thermal infrared multispectral scanner data: implications for recovering land surface temperatures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317447/","displayDocTitle":"Separating temperature and emissivity in thermal infrared multispectral scanner data: implications for recovering land surface temperatures","volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638658","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separating temperature and emissivity in thermal infrared multispectral scanner data: implications for recovering land surface temperatures","sourcePdf":"00317447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071847S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"7649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"189","articleId":"317447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":317462,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Two new net models are introduced and we prove theoretically that the net models are accurate approximations of the widely used half perimeter of a rectangle enclosing all pins of a net. In addition, unlike the half perimeter model, our net models allow us to compute costs for assigning cells to locations independently for all cells to be placed simultaneously. This offers our algorithm an important advantage compared to other iterative improvement techniques: many cells can be placed simultaneously by formulating placement as a network flow problem. This makes our algorithm more independent from a processing sequence than standard iterative improvement techniques. Finally, we compare our method to some existing algorithms including TimberWolfSC 5.4. We ran all of the algorithms on the SIGDA Benchmark Suite. We found that our method produced solutions with up to 23% less layout area while using an order of magnitude less running time compared to TimberWolfSC 5.4.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.317462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7650/00317462.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.317462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative placement improvement by network flow methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Iterative placement improvement by network flow methods","volume":"13","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4779975","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317462/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative placement improvement by network flow methods","sourcePdf":"00317462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041157S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"67","articleId":"317462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317464,"authors":[{"name":"J.

When a test pattern has to be applied to the input of an embedded module, determination of a sequence of instructions, which will apply this pattern and propagate the fault effects, is extremely difficult. After the instruction sequence is derived, to assign values at all interior lines without conflicts is also very difficult. In this paper, we propose a separation of test generation process into two phases: path analysis and value analysis. In the phase of path analysis, a new methodology for automatic assembly of a sequence of instructions is proposed to satisfy the internal test goals. In the phase of value analysis, an equation-solving algorithm is used to compute an exact value solution for all interior lines. This new ATPG methodology containing techniques for both path and value analysis forms a complete solution for a variety of microprocessor-like circuits. This new approach has been implemented and experimented on six high-level circuits.

The goal of this work is to include interconnect parasitics in a circuit simulation as efficiently as possible, without significantly compromising accuracy. Stability issues and enhancements to incorporate transmission line interconnects are also discussed. A unified circuit simulation framework, incorporating different classes of interconnects and based on the proposed macromodels, is described. The simplicity and generality of the macromodels is demonstrated through examples employing RC- and RLC-interconnects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7650/00317469.pdf","startPage":"1257","endPage":"1270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.317469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.317469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain macromodels for VLSI interconnect analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Very large scale integration","Integrated circuit interconnections","Circuit simulation","RLC circuits","USA Councils","Analytical models","Timing","Computational modeling","Function approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","equivalent circuits","transmission line theory","time-domain analysis","multiport networks","stability","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain macromodels","VLSI interconnect analysis","circuit simulation","interconnect parasitics","stability","transmission line interconnects","unified circuit simulation framework","RC-interconnects","RLC-interconnects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain macromodels for VLSI interconnect analysis","volume":"13","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4779981","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain macromodels for VLSI interconnect analysis","sourcePdf":"00317469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048413S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"54","articleId":"317469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":317470,"authors":[{"name":"A.

No restrictions are applied to either the number of switching inputs or the transition times and relative delays of the input voltages. The relative positions of the switching inputs are also accounted for in the case of series-connected MOSFET's. When combined with our previously reported CMOS inverter model, the peak current is obtained in a time approximately three orders faster than HSPICE with the level-3 MOSFET model. The corresponding accuracy is around 12%. If the current waveform is required, the speed improvement is about an order less. Since the inverter model also yields the delay at no extra cost, the timing of the current waveforms can be done automatically, without recourse to a timing simulator. Although the emphasis here is on CMOS static gates, the method is applicable to dynamic logic gates as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.317470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7650/00317470.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.317470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverter models of CMOS gates for supply current and delay evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317470/","displayDocTitle":"Inverter models of CMOS gates for supply current and delay evaluation","volume":"13","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4779982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverter models of CMOS gates for supply current and delay evaluation","sourcePdf":"00317470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05917S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"82","articleId":"317470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317500,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This method approximates the amplifier cavity by dividing it into M discrete subsections, and TMM has been applied to analyze the stepwise longitudinal field distribution at each subsection along the amplifier cavity. By incorporating also the carrier rate equations into the analysis, it has been shown that the approximation can accurately describe the carrier density and longitudinal field distribution along the amplifier cavity if M is sufficiently large (i.e., the size of each subsection is about an order of magnitude of one wavelength of the input signal). By assuming that the amplifier is biased below oscillation threshold such that the contribution of spontaneous emissions to the gain characteristics can be neglected, we have shown that our proposed method yields a fast and efficient algorithm in analyzing the gain and saturation characteristics of laser amplifiers. We have compared the results produced by our method to those analyzed using the average photon density (AVPD) approximation technique, as well as to experimental results on a 1.5-/spl mu/m buried heterostructure semiconductor laser amplifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.317525","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7652/00317525.pdf","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1386","doi":"10.1109/50.317525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of gain and saturation characteristics of a semiconductor laser optical amplifier using transfer matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of gain and saturation characteristics of a semiconductor laser optical amplifier using transfer matrices","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4786566","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317525/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of gain and saturation characteristics of a semiconductor laser optical amplifier using transfer matrices","sourcePdf":"00317525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041737S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"18","articleId":"317525","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":317529,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

It is shown that the measured through-power in series branches is a logical source of local control intelligence for modulation of series compensation in such branches.

Fouad et al. the concept of system vulnerability is introduced as a new framework for power system dynamic security assessment. Using the transient energy function (TEF) method of transient stability analysis, the energy margin /spl Delta/V is used as an indicator of the level of security, and its sensitivity to a changing system parameter p (/spl delta//spl Delta/V//spl delta/p) as an indicator of its trend with changing system conditions. These two indicators are combined to determine the degree of system vulnerability to contingent disturbances in a stability-limited power system. Thresholds for acceptable levels of the security indicator and its trend are related to the stability limits of a critical system parameter (plant generation limits). Operating practices and policies are used to determine these thresholds. In this paper the artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique is applied to the concept of system vulnerability within the recently developed framework, for fast pattern recognition and classification of system dynamic security status. A suitable topology for the neural network is developed, and the appropriate training method and input and output signals are selected. The procedure developed is successfully applied to the IEEE 50-generator test system. Data previously obtained by heuristic techniques are used for training the ANN.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317570","startPage":"525","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7653","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7653/00317570.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of artificial neural networks in power system security and vulnerability assessment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317570/","displayDocTitle":"Application of artificial neural networks in power system security and vulnerability assessment","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4698487","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of artificial neural networks in power system security and vulnerability assessment","sourcePdf":"00317570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034795S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"35","articleId":"317570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":317572,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A rescheduling policy is essential for stochastic risk evaluation; thus one is described in this paper. The risk and the average operating reserve are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation, and the Monte Carlo simulation is applied to the IEEE-RTS in order to demonstrate the effect of load uncertainty on the risk and on the average amount of required operating reserve.

In short, the method consists of building offline decision trees, able to subsequently assess the system transient behavior in terms of precontingency parameters (or \"attributes\") of it, likely to drive the stability phenomena. This case study aims at investigating practical feasibility aspects and features of the trees, at enhancing their reliability to the extent possible, and at generalizing them. Feasibility aspects encompass database generation, candidate attributes, stability classes; tree features concern in particular complexity in terms of their size and interpretability capabilities, robustness with respect to both their building and use. Reliability is enhanced by defining and exploiting pragmatic quality measures. Generalization concerns multicontingency, instead of single-contingency trees. The results obtained show real promise for the method to meet practical needs of electric power utilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4698480","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decision tree based transient stability method a case study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision tree based transient stability method a case study","sourcePdf":"00317577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046292S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"94","articleId":"317577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317579,"authors":[{"name":"G.

When the system load changes, cost and emissions also change to values which depend on the objective function to be minimized and in turn on the weighting factors assigned to each function in the case of multi-objective optimization. This requires a new optimal solution for any change in system load. A dispatcher may need to change a weighting factor in order to reduce emissions or cost from one case to another which requires a complete solution of the problem any time a change takes place. However, if the changes in system loading are not too large or a small change in a weighting factor or emissions constraint is needed, then a sensitivity analysis may be used without losing significant accuracy to change the state of the system in real time which has the advantage of requiring less time than a complete optimal solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7653","startPage":"436","endPage":"442","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7653/00317580.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00317580.png","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317580","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity analysis","Load flow","Voltage","Gold","Cost function","Reactive power","Real time systems","Power system analysis computing","Power generation","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution detection and control","electric power generation","load flow","load dispatching","economics","optimisation","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","minimum emissions power flow","system load changes","multi-objective optimization","load dispatch","emissions reduction","cost reduction","weighting factor","emissions constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A sensitivity analysis approach to minimum emissions power flow","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4698477","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317580/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sensitivity analysis approach to minimum emissions power flow","sourcePdf":"00317580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030458S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"10","articleId":"317580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":317581,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

In recent years, the time-of-use (TOU) tariff based on the peak load pricing theory has been one of the most effective load management strategies. Proper TOU rate structure can actually reflect the generation cost of electricity supplying and give a guideline for customers to modify the power consumption pattern so that the system load factor can be improved. The inverse electricity pricing rule can be applied as the basis of TOU pricing.

A major difficulty in obtaining global optimal solutions for complex, real-life networks is due to the nonconvexity of the problem. Hierarchical decomposition has proved to be an efficient heuristic for coping with nonconvexity, as illustrated in the test results section of the paper. Significant reductions in investment costs have been obtained in some practical cases for which results are available in the literature. The current implementation of the hierarchical decomposition approach utilizes three different levels of network modeling: transportation models, hybrid models, and linearized power flow models. An initial solution is obtained for the simplest model (transportation model) and as one moves towards the final solution the algorithm successively switches to more accurate models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7653/00317588.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.317588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical decomposition approach for transmission network expansion planning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Network topology","Process planning","Power system planning","Investments","Transportation","Load flow","Circuit testing","Switches","Power system interconnection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system planning","load flow","transmission networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Benders decomposition","network expansion planning","hierarchical decomposition approach","transmission network expansion planning","global optimal solutions","nonconvexity","investment costs reduction","transportation models","hybrid models","linearized power flow models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical decomposition approach for transmission network expansion planning","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4698469","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical decomposition approach for transmission network expansion planning","sourcePdf":"00317588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040973S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"275","articleId":"317588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":317592,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.

However, to make such measures more useful as a security assessment tool in an operational environment. It is important to provide physical interpretations of the quantitative measure. This paper demonstrates that for certain basic load models, the energy based security measure is equal to the area enclosed by a familiar Q-V curve, with a change of scale on the voltage axis. This interpretation has the added benefit of providing easily computed approximations to the maximum real and reactive power loadability both at individual buses and for the system as a whole. Results are demonstrated in detail on the IEEE 118 bus system, with additional tests on a 415 bus sample system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"331","endPage":"340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7653/00317593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Q-V curve interpretations of energy measures for voltage security","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy measurement","Voltage measurement","Power system security","Power system modeling","Power measurement","Power system measurements","Load modeling","Area measurement","Reactive power","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","power system protection","power system stability","transmission networks","power system analysis computing","approximation theory","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Q-V curve interpretations","voltage security","energy methods","power systems","voltage instability","voltage collapse","security assessment","load models","approximations","real power loadability","reactive power loadability","buses","transmission networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Q-V curve interpretations of energy measures for voltage security","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4698464","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317593/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Q-V curve interpretations of energy measures for voltage security","sourcePdf":"00317593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037079S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"49","articleId":"317593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317594,"authors":[{"name":"K.

That paper raised some issues of modeling which require more extensive attention than is feasible in an ordinary discussion. In this paper, the author demonstrates that, regardless of the adequacy of second (one rotor damper branch) or third (two rotor damper branches) order models, a simple form for the rotor can be used. Physical reasoning was used by Atarod et al. to postulate the need for a \"differential leakage\" inductance element, representing flux linking both the field winding end damper bars but not the armature winding. The author employs circuit theory to demonstrate that this leakage element does not, by itself, contribute anything to the dynamics of rotor response, and that it is not required to adequately model the frequency response of rotor impedance. This means, that at least some of the conclusions of Atarod et al. are probably due to an artifact of the curve fitting technique used. Another curve fitting technique and its results are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"262","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7653","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7653/00317602.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equivalent circuits","Shock absorbers","Damping","Curve fitting","Inductance","Joining processes","Bars","Circuit theory","Frequency response","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbogenerators","curve fitting","synchronous generators","rotors","equivalent circuits","machine theory","frequency response","inductance","electric impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbine-generator rotor","equivalent circuits","differential leakage inductance element","field winding end damper bars","circuit theory","curve fitting technique","driving point impedance","second order model","third order model","synchronous machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On turbine-generator rotor equivalent circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317602/","volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4698455","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On turbine-generator rotor equivalent circuits","sourcePdf":"00317602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029087S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"27","articleId":"317602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":317604,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Shiow Kao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Taipei Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Shiow Kao","id":"37368514900"},{"name":"Chia-Jen Lin","affiliation":["System Planning Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Jen Lin","id":"37349661300"},{"name":"Chiang-Tsang Huang","affiliation":["System Planning Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chiang-Tsang Huang","id":"37384916400"},{"name":"Yung-Tien Chen","affiliation":["System Planning Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Tien Chen","id":"37384807600"},{"name":"Chiew-Yann Chiou","affiliation":["System Planning Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chiew-Yann Chiou","id":"37342840600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"317604","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":571},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"abstract":"Time domain stability simulation results using derived load models were compared with corresponding data obtained from transient disturbance recorders to validate the accuracy of the load models.

The third is to provide a review of innovative approaches to transmission asset management and finance as seen from international experience.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Power generation","Power system management","Power system economics","Power engineering and energy","Finance","Power industry","Costs","Asset management","Power generation economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economics","tariffs","power systems","management","transmission networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission system management","transmission system pricing","electric power system","electric power industry","long run marginal costs","short run marginal costs","international experience","tariffs"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317608","startPage":"206","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7653/00317608.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.317608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission system management and pricing: new paradigms and international comparisons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Transmission system management and pricing: new paradigms and international comparisons","accessionNumber":"4698449","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","volume":"9","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission system management and pricing: new paradigms and international comparisons","sourcePdf":"00317608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036929S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"68","articleId":"317608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":317624,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Yih Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Yih Hsu","id":"37087174698"},{"name":"Chien-Chuen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Chuen Yang","id":"37087180465"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"317624","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317624","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Clustering algorithms","Optimal scheduling","Dynamic programming","Data mining","Capacitors","Dynamic scheduling","Knowledge management","Load forecasting","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","power system computer control","neural nets","dynamic programming","power capacitors","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","dynamic programming","feeder capacitor scheduling","historical load data","cluster algorithms","hard clustering","Euclidean algorithm","soft clustering","unsupervised learning","execution time"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.317624","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7654/00317624.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid artificial neural network-dynamic programming approach for feeder capacitor scheduling","abstract":"A hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) dynamic programming (DP) method for optimal feeder capacitor scheduling is presented in this paper. To overcome the time-consuming problem of full dynamic programming method, a strategy of ANN assisted partial DP is proposed. In this method, the DP procedures are performed on historical load data offline. The results are managed and valuable knowledge is extracted by using cluster algorithms. By the assistance of the extracted knowledge, a partial DP of reduced size is then performed online to give the optimal schedule for the forecasted load. Two types of clustering algorithms, hard clustering by Euclidean algorithm and soft clustering by an unsupervised learning neural network, are studied and compared in the paper. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by a typical feeder in Taipei City with its 365 days' load records. It is found that execution time of scheduling is highly reduced, while the cost is almost the same as the optimal one derived from full DP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4748340","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid artificial neural network-dynamic programming approach for feeder capacitor scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid artificial neural network-dynamic programming approach for feeder capacitor scheduling","sourcePdf":"00317624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074933S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"40","articleId":"317624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":317625,"authors":[{"name":"E.

After system-wide constraints are relaxed by Lagrange multipliers, the problem is converted into the scheduling of individual units. This paper concentrates on the solution methodology for pumped-storage units. There are, many constraints limiting the operation of a pumped-storage unit, such as pond level dynamics and constraints, and discontinuous generation and pumping regions. The most challenging issue in solving pumped-storage subproblems within the Lagrangian relaxation framework is the integrated consideration of these constraints. The basic idea of the method is to relax the pond level dynamics and constraints by using another set of multipliers. The subproblem is then converted into the optimization of generation or pumping; levels for each operating state at individual hours, and the optimization of operating states across hours. The optimal generation or pumping level for a particular operating state at each hour can be obtained by optimizing a single variable function without discretizing pond levels. Dynamic programming is then used to optimize operating states across hours with only a few number of states and transitions. A subgradient algorithm is used to update the pond level Lagrangian multipliers. This method provides an efficient way to solve a class of subproblems involving continuous dynamics and constraints, discontinuous operating regions, and discrete operating states.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317641","startPage":"1023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7654/00317641.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317641","endPage":"1031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization-based scheduling of hydrothermal power systems with pumped-storage units","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimization-based scheduling of hydrothermal power systems with pumped-storage units","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4748335","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization-based scheduling of hydrothermal power systems with pumped-storage units","sourcePdf":"00317641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101799S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"109","articleId":"317641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317646,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

The implementation is accomplished by utilizing a comprehensive load forecasting model consisting of time series, nonlinear load-weather functions and a residual load function represented by an ARMA (auto-regressive moving average) model. The model parameters are estimated and updated online using the WRLS (weighted recursive least squares) algorithm. A variable forgetting factor (VFF) technique is incorporated in the WRLS algorithm for improved model tracking and numerical performance in real-time operation. A software package, STLF, is developed with the proposed implementation method for distribution power utilities. Practical operation of the STLF in several power utilities has demonstrated great success. Offline testing and online operation has consistently shown satisfactory performance with the mean absolute error (MAE) mostly less than 2% for a less than 24-hour ahead forecast and less than 2.5% for a less than 168-hour ahead forecast.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317646","startPage":"988","endPage":"994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7654/00317646.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time implementation of short-term load forecasting for distribution power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Predictive models","Weather forecasting","Load modeling","Parameter estimation","Recursive estimation","Least squares approximation","Numerical models","Software packages","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","load forecasting","stochastic processes","time series","real-time systems","power system analysis computing","digital simulation","least squares approximations","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term load forecasting","distribution power systems","real-time","time series","nonlinear load-weather functions","residual load function","ARMA model","weighted recursive least squares algorithm","variable forgetting factor","performance","software package","STLF","mean absolute error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"A real-time implementation of short-term load forecasting for distribution power systems","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4748330","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time implementation of short-term load forecasting for distribution power systems","sourcePdf":"00317646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037545S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"99","articleId":"317646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":317648,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The need of an infinite bus representation is avoided with the linearized nodal power balance approach. This permits the model to be easily extended to any number of network buses. In the linearized form, the resulting power sensitivity model (PSM), presents some interesting features, such as decoupled modelling and time scale decomposition properties. For presentation reasons, the PSM is first derived for a single generator connected to an infinite bus. Its performance is then compared with the classical Heffron-Phillips Model, as described by de Mello and Concordia (1969). Finally, it is extended for multinodal networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7654/00317649.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"971","doi":"10.1109/59.317649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power sensitivity model for electromechanical oscillation studies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"A power sensitivity model for electromechanical oscillation studies","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4748327","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A power sensitivity model for electromechanical oscillation studies","sourcePdf":"00317649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124442S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"29","articleId":"317649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":317653,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Effective transaction decisions can result in significant savings since marginal generation costs of neighboring utilities could be quite different.

How to make effective transaction decisions is therefore a very difficult problem. In this paper, an optimization-based method for the integrated consideration of power purchase transactions and the scheduling of thermal units is presented based on the augmented Lagrangian decomposition and coordination method.

Many outstanding methods to this problem have been proposed in the past. However, most these approaches have the common defect of being caught to a local minimum solution. The integer problem which yields integer value solutions for discrete controllers/banks still remain as a difficult one. The genetic algorithm is a kind of search algorithm based on the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. This algorithm can search for a global solution using multiple paths and treat integer problems naturally. The proposed method was applied to practical 51-bus and 224-bus systems to show its feasibility and capabilities. Although this method is not as fast as sophisticated traditional methods, the concept is quite promising and useful in the coming computer age.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317674","endPage":"692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7654/00317674.pdf","startPage":"685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive power optimization by genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317674/","displayDocTitle":"Reactive power optimization by genetic algorithm","volume":"9","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4748290","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive power optimization by genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00317674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028736S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"286","articleId":"317674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317676,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Tung Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Saint John''s and Saint Mary''s Institute of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Tung Hsiao","id":"37279726800"},{"name":"Hsiao-Dong Chiang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Hsiao-Dong Chiang","id":"37273838900"},{"name":"Chung-Chang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Chang Liu","id":"37384613400"},{"name":"Yuan-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Lin Chen","id":"37281033800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"317676","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317676","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packaging","Reactive power","Power system planning","Simulated annealing","Constraint optimization","Power system simulation","Power system security","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","power system planning","reactive power","software packages","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multi-objective VAr planning","large scale power systems","computer package","SAMVAR","nondifferentiable optimization problem","system investment","system operational efficiency","system security","system service quality","contingency constraints","inequality constraint","equality constraint","two-stage solution algorithm","E-constraint method","simulated annealing","constrained multi-objective optimization problem","global optimal solution"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a simulated annealing based computer package for multi-objective, VAr planning in large scale power systems-SAMVAR. This computer package has three distinct features. First, the optimal VAr planning is reformulated as a constrained, multi-objective, nondifferentiable optimization problem. The new formulation considers four different objective functions related to system investment, system operational efficiency, system security and system service quality. The new formulation also takes into consideration load, operation and contingency constraints. Second, it allows both the objective functions and equality and inequality constraints to be nondifferentiable; making the problem formulation more realistic. Third, the package employs a two-stage solution algorithm based on an extended simulated annealing technique and the E-constraint method. The first-stage of the solution algorithm uses an extended simulated annealing technique to find a global, noninferior solution. The results obtained from the first-stage provide a basis for planners to prioritize the objective functions such that a primary objective function is chosen and tradeoff tolerances for the other objective functions are set. The primary objective function and the trade-off tolerances are then used to transform the constrained multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective optimization problem with more constraints by employing the E-constraint method. The second-stage uses the simulated annealing technique to find the global optimal solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.317676","startPage":"668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7654/00317676.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317676","endPage":"676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computer package for optimal multi-objective VAr planning in large scale power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"A computer package for optimal multi-objective VAr planning in large scale power systems","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4748288","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computer package for optimal multi-objective VAr planning in large scale power systems","sourcePdf":"00317676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043254S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"89","articleId":"317676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":317681,"authors":[{"name":"F.D.

Although these techniques are considered efficient for most applications, in cases involving repeated solutions such as security analysis or real time control, direct solvers may still not be sufficiently fast. The incomplete Cholesky pre-conditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm is a very powerful semi-iterative solver which has been proven to have significant speed advantages over direct methods in the area of finite element electromagnetic analysis (ratios of 100 to 1 are not uncommon). In this paper, the PCG algorithm is applied to the fast decoupled load flow and to the DC load flow. The computation time of the new PCG algorithm is compared with that of a standard direct solver for a wide spectrum of power networks up to 5000 buses and 10000 lines. The results of our numerical experiments indicate that for certain classes of large sparse systems or for repeated solutions with matrix modifications, the PCG method is significantly more efficient than direct techniques and offers important savings in CPU time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Power system analysis computing","Power system security","Equations","Finite element methods","Electromagnetic analysis","Character generation","Load flow","Clustering algorithms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","load flow","conjugate gradient methods","matrix algebra","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cholesky pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm","sparse linear equations","power network analysis","semi-iterative methods","finite element methods","fast decoupled load flow","DC load flow","computation time","matrix","computer simulation","CPU time"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.317681","startPage":"629","endPage":"636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7654/00317681.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.317681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the application of a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to power network analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"On the application of a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to power network analysis","accessionNumber":"4748283","publicationDate":"May 1994","volume":"9","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to power network analysis","sourcePdf":"00317681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039224S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"21","articleId":"317681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":317683,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The type abstraction hierarchy integrates the abstraction view with the subsumption (is-a) and composition (part-of) views of a type hierarchy. Such a framework provides multilevel object representation, which is an important aspect of cooperative query answering. The concept of pattern that specifies one or more conditions on an object is also proposed. Patterns have smaller granularity than types, and thus provide more specific semantic information. Cooperative query answering consists of query relaxation, generalization, specialization, and association on patterns. Query relaxation can be explicitly specified by the user or implicitly performed by the system. The implicit and explicit relaxations can also be combined and performed interactively by both the system and the user. CSQL, an extension of SQL for cooperative query answering, is also proposed. Preliminary experimental results reveal that the proposed type abstraction hierarchy provides an organized structure representing concepts at different knowledge levels in various domains, and provides a systematic and efficient method for cooperative query answering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4787999","volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A structured approach for cooperative query answering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A structured approach for cooperative query answering","sourcePdf":"00317704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050132S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"48","articleId":"317704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":317720,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yong Yan","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Department of Mathematics, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia"],"lastName":"Wei-Yong Yan","id":"37087001973"},{"name":"U.

Not only are such fundamental issues as existence, uniqueness, and representation of solutions completely resolved, but also the convergence issue is resolved. It is shown that the solution of Oja's equation is exponentially convergent to an equilibrium from any initial value. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient conditions are given on the initial value for the solution to converge to a dominant eigenspace of the associated autocorrelation matrix. As a by-product, this result confirms one of Oja's conjectures that the solution converges to the principal eigenspace from almost all initial values. Some other characteristics of the limiting solution are also revealed. These facilitate the determination of the limiting solution in advance using only the initial information. Two examples are analyzed demonstrating the explicit dependence of the limiting solution on the initial value. In another respect, it is found that Oja's equation is the gradient flow of generalized Rayleigh quotients on a Stiefel manifold.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317720/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4776097","pubMedId":"18267842","volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Global analysis of Oja's flow for neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global analysis of Oja's flow for neural networks","sourcePdf":"00317720.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045083S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"66","articleId":"317720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":317721,"authors":[{"name":"K.I.

First, the authors formulate the solution to the general reduced-rank linear approximation problem relaxing the invertibility assumption of the input autocorrelation matrix used by previous authors. The authors' treatment unifies linear regression, Wiener filtering, full rank approximation, auto-association networks, SVD and principal component analysis (PCA) as special cases. The authors' analysis also shows that two-layer linear neural networks with reduced number of hidden units, trained with the least-squares error criterion, produce weights that correspond to the generalized singular value decomposition of the input-teacher cross-correlation matrix and the input data matrix. As a corollary the linear two-layer backpropagation model with reduced hidden layer extracts an arbitrary linear combination of the generalized singular vector components. Second, the authors investigate artificial neural network models for the solution of the related generalized eigenvalue problem. By introducing and utilizing the extended concept of deflation (originally proposed for the standard eigenvalue problem) the authors are able to find that a sequential version of linear BP can extract the exact generalized eigenvector components. The advantage of this approach is that it's easier to update the model structure by adding one more unit or pruning one or more units when the application requires it. An alternative approach for extracting the exact components is to use a set of lateral connections among the hidden units trained in such a way as to enforce orthogonality among the upper- and lower-layer weights. The authors call this the lateral orthogonalization network (LON) and show via theoretical analysis-and verify via simulation-that the network extracts the desired components. The advantage of the LON-based model is that it can be applied in a parallel fashion so that the components are extracted concurrently. Finally, the authors show the application of their results to the solution of the identification problem of systems whose excitation has a non-invertible autocorrelation matrix. Previous identification methods usually rely on the invertibility assumption of the input autocorrelation, therefore they can not be applied to this case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.317721","startPage":"684","endPage":"697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.317721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7656/00317721.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer neural networks for reduced-rank approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317721/","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer neural networks for reduced-rank approximation","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4776098","pubMedId":"18267843","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer neural networks for reduced-rank approximation","sourcePdf":"00317721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088135S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"21","articleId":"317721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":317723,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

The results are especially useful for analyzing the stabilities of asymmetric neural networks. A constraint on the connection matrix has been found under which the neural network has a unique and exponentially stable equilibrium. Given any connection matrix, this constraint can be satisfied through the adjustment of the gains of the amplifiers and the resistances in the neural net circuit. A one-to-one and smooth map between input currents and the equilibria of the neural network can be set up. The above results can be applied to the master/slave net to prove that the master net can find the best connection matrix for the slave net. For the neural network disturbed by some noise, the stochastic stability of the network is also analyzed. A special asymmetric neural network formed by a closed chain of formal neurons is also studied for its stability and oscillation. Both stable and oscillatory dynamics are obtained in the closed chain network through the adjustment of the gains and resistances of the amplifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.317724","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7656/00317724.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"729","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.317724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential stability and oscillation of Hopfield graded response neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Exponential stability and oscillation of Hopfield graded response neural network","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4776101","pubMedId":"18267846","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential stability and oscillation of Hopfield graded response neural network","sourcePdf":"00317724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043839S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"108","articleId":"317724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":317725,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.

The results appear to be perfectly general for all training schemes where weights are adjusted incrementally, and have wide-ranging implications for all applications, particularly those involving \"inaccurate\" analog neural VLSI.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4776106","pubMedId":"18267852","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced MLP performance and fault tolerance resulting from synaptic weight noise during training","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced MLP performance and fault tolerance resulting from synaptic weight noise during training","sourcePdf":"00317730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05215S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"127","articleId":"317730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317732,"authors":[{"name":"Hoon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Control and Instrumentation Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoon Kang","id":"37087337063"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"317732","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Neural networks","Associative memory","Magnesium compounds","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Potential energy","Sufficient conditions","Noise robustness","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","content-addressable storage","learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptive systems","character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer associative neural networks","storage capacity","energy function","multilayer associative memories","triple-layered hybrid neural network","Kohonen adaptive learning algorithm","Kosko bidirectional associative memory","orthogonal input/output basis vectors","Walsh series","energy local minima","noise-free recall","learning","character recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317732","abstract":"The objective of this paper is to to resolve important issues in artificial neural nets-exact recall and capacity in multilayer associative memories. These problems have imposed restrictions on coding strategies. We propose the following triple-layered hybrid neural network: the first synapse is a one-shot associative memory using the modified Kohonen's adaptive learning algorithm with arbitrary input patterns; the second one is Kosko's bidirectional associative memory consisting of orthogonal input/output basis vectors such as Walsh series satisfying the strict continuity condition; and finally, the third one is a simple one-shot associative memory with arbitrary output images. A mathematical framework based on the relationship between energy local minima (capacity of the neural net) and noise-free recall is established. The robust capacity conditions of this multilayer associative neural network that lead to forming the local minima of the energy function at the exact training pairs are derived. The chosen strategy not only maximizes the total number of stored images but also completely relaxes any code-dependent conditions of the learning pairs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.317732","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7656/00317732.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"822","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.317732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer associative neural networks (MANN's): storage capacity versus perfect recall","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer associative neural networks (MANN's): storage capacity versus perfect recall","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4776108","pubMedId":"18267854","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer associative neural networks (MANN's): storage capacity versus perfect recall","sourcePdf":"00317732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047538S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"29","articleId":"317732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317733,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is assumed that the knowledge of partial-band noise jamming fraction is available to the JSI generator. Because this scheme reduces the M-dimensional information into one dimension, i.e., the total energy, the generated JSI may not be the best. In this paper, a neural network approach to the JSI generation is presented. The efficiency of the new JSI generator with known partial-band noise jamming fraction is compared with the MAP generator. The neural network scheme is then generalized to increase its robustness by allowing for an unknown partial-band noise jamming fraction. The neural network JSI generator with or even without knowledge of jamming fraction offers significantly better performance for a coded FH/MFSK communication system than the MAP JSI generator for high code rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.317735","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7656/00317735.pdf","startPage":"833","endPage":"837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.317735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network applications for jamming state information generator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network applications for jamming state information generator","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4776109","pubMedId":"18267856","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network applications for jamming state information generator","sourcePdf":"00317735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055863S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"1","articleId":"317735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":317736,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Cheng Yen","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jui-Cheng Yen","id":"37087163787"},{"name":"Fu-Juay Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fu-Juay Chang","id":"37087300274"},{"name":"Shyang Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyang Chang","id":"37087401869"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"317736","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Artificial neural networks","Convergence","Neurons","Humans","Zinc","Logic functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","parallel architectures","convergence of numerical methods","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["winners-take-all architecture","neural networks","MAXNET","common competitive architecture","convergence rate","SELECTRON","maxima selection","minima selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317736","abstract":"MAXNET is a common competitive architecture to select the maximum or minimum from a set of data. However, there are two major problems with the MAXNET. The first problem is its slow convergence rate if all the data have nearly the same value. The second one is that it fails when either nonunique extreme values exist or each initial value is smaller than or equal to the sum of initial inhibitions from other nodes. In this paper, a novel neural network model called SELECTRON is proposed to select the maxima or minima from a set of data. This model is able to select all the maxima or minima via competition among the processing units even when MAXNET fails. We then prove that SELECTRON converges to the correct state in every situation. In addition, the convergence rates of SELECTRON for three special data distributions are derived. Finally, simulation results indicate that SELECTRON converges much faster than MAXNET.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.317736","startPage":"838","endPage":"843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.317736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7656/00317736.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new winners-take-all architecture in artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317736/","displayDocTitle":"A new winners-take-all architecture in artificial neural networks","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4776110","pubMedId":"18267857","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new winners-take-all architecture in artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00317736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080341S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"19","articleId":"317736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":317740,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

For recurrent neural networks no general methods exist that permit the estimation of the number of layers of hidden neurons, the size of layers or the number of weights. We present a simple pruning heuristic that significantly improves the generalization performance of trained recurrent networks. We illustrate this heuristic by training a fully recurrent neural network on positive and negative strings of a regular grammar. We also show that rules extracted from networks trained with this pruning heuristic are more consistent with the rules to be learned. This performance improvement is obtained by pruning and retraining the networks. Simulations are shown for training and pruning a recurrent neural net on strings generated by two regular grammars, a randomly-generated 10-state grammar and an 8-state, triple-parity grammar. Further simulations indicate that this pruning method can have generalization performance superior to that obtained by training with weight decay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.317740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7656/00317740.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"851","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00317740.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.317740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pruning recurrent neural networks for improved generalization performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317740/","displayDocTitle":"Pruning recurrent neural networks for improved generalization performance","volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4776113","pubMedId":"18267860","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pruning recurrent neural networks for improved generalization performance","sourcePdf":"00317740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034961S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"77","articleId":"317740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317764,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

Unlike conventional cellular systems, emerging wireless personal-communication networks will most likely operate in confined, urban environments (microcells). The application of broad-band-digital modulation to these networks requires careful consideration of the dispersive nature of the urban radio channel. This paper presents a ray-tracing simulation technique which incorporates site-specific environmental data, such as the location, the orientation, and the electrical properties of buildings, to predict path loss and delay spread in urban microcells. Using simplified geometric-optics assumptions, rays are traced in three dimensions. This determines the paths by which direct, specularly reflected and transmitted, diffusely scattered, and diffracted rays arrive at a receiver. The received rays are combined noncoherently as a function of delay, to estimate the channel power-delay profile. The power-delay profile is used for verification of model accuracy, via qualitative and statistical comparisons of measured and predicted data, for receiver locations on the Virginia Tech campus. The comparisons conclusively show the simulation's ability to accurately model urban microcellular propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/74.317764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/7657/00317764.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.317764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microcellular radio-channel propagation prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317764/","displayDocTitle":"Microcellular radio-channel propagation prediction","volume":"36","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798650","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microcellular radio-channel propagation prediction","sourcePdf":"00317764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046723S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"34","articleId":"317764","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317832,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Except for the output voltage, the results of the DVFT are comparable to those of the present high-T/sub c/ devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/77.317832","startPage":"161","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.317832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/7658/00317832.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete superconducting vortex flow transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317832/","displayDocTitle":"Discrete superconducting vortex flow transistors","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4782840","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete superconducting vortex flow transistors","sourcePdf":"00317832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048122S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"27","articleId":"317832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":317847,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

This procedure Is motivated by viewing the equiripple design of filters in linear time-invariant systems as a process of obtaining optimum minimax filters for a class of bounded energy input signals. The philosophy of designing optimum minimax filters for classes of input signals is extended to multirate systems, which are not time-invariant. We develop a generalized Fourier analysis appropriate for linear periodic systems and use it to derive new error criteria for multirate filter design. Using such criteria yields optimum minimax multirate filters for the input signal class. The utility of our method is demonstrated by using it to analyze several multirate systems. We give numerical results on the design of a multirate implementation of a narrowband filter and compare our work to previous work on multirate filter design. Our numerical analysis is based upon a new formulation of the design as a semi-infinite linear programming problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4782849","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear periodic systems and multirate filter design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear periodic systems and multirate filter design","sourcePdf":"00317847.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110247S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"66","articleId":"317847","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-02"},{"_id":317848,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.

The representation is based on supremum, minimum, and addition operations, and does not require any multiplications. However, this representation has not been practical because its essence is to evaluate the supremum of a set with an infinite number of elements. Based on the previously developed morphological representation, we present a finite max-min representation for ILTI filters. The new representation does not require the use of multipliers and is practical, in the sense that it consists of a finite number of maximum, minimum, and addition operations. The proposed max-min representation is modified to cover FIR linear shift invariant filters in general. The modified representation requires only one multiplication per output sample and has lower computational complexity than the max-min representation.

The signal and noise model used is based on the assumption that the data are received by two arrays well separated so that their noise outputs are uncorrelated. The generalized correlation decomposition of the cross-correlation matrix between the two arrays is then introduced. Of particular interest is the canonical correlation decomposition. The analysis of the generalized correlation leads to various interesting geometric and asymptotic properties of the eigenspace structure. Two algorithms, UN-MUSIC and UN-CLE, are developed to estimate the DOA of signals in unknown spatially correlated noise based on the utilization of these properties. Computer simulations show that these methods are superior in performance compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the new methods are equally effective even when only one sensor array is employed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.317855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7659/00317855.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.317855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7659","startPage":"2331","endPage":"2343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UN-MUSIC and UN-CLE: an application of generalized correlation analysis to the estimation of the direction of arrival of signals in unknown correlated noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"UN-MUSIC and UN-CLE: an application of generalized correlation analysis to the estimation of the direction of arrival of signals in unknown correlated noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317855/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4782857","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UN-MUSIC and UN-CLE: an application of generalized correlation analysis to the estimation of the direction of arrival of signals in unknown correlated noise","sourcePdf":"00317855.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064104S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","articleId":"317855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317857,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

Two eigenstructure-based estimation algorithms that operate in beamspace and employ phase mode excitation-based beamformers have been developed. The first, UCA-RB-MUSIC, is a beamspace version of MUSIC that offers numerous advantages over element space operation, including reduced computation, as subspace estimates are obtained via real-valued eigendecompositions, enhanced performance in correlated source scenarios due to the attendant forward-backward averaging effect, and the applicability of Root-MUSIC. The second, UCA-ESPRIT, represents a significant advance in the area of 2D angle estimation. It is a novel closed-form algorithm that provides automatically paired source azimuth and elevation estimates. With UCA-ESPRIT, the eigenvalues of a matrix have the form /spl mu//sub i/=sin /spl theta//sub i/e/sup j/spl phi/(i/), where /spl theta//sub i/ and /spl phi//sub i/ are the elevation and azimuth angles, respectively. Expensive search procedures being thus avoided, UCA-ESPRIT is superior to existing 2D angle estimation algorithms with respect to computational complexity. Finally, asymptotic expressions for the variances of the element space MUSIC and UCA-RB-MUSIC estimators for the 2D scenario have been derived. Results of simulations that compare UCA-RB-MUSIC and UCA-ESPRIT and also validate the theoretical performance expressions are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.317861","startPage":"2395","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00317861.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7659/00317861.pdf","endPage":"2407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.317861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317861/","displayDocTitle":"Eigenstructure techniques for 2-D angle estimation with uniform circular arrays","volume":"42","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4782863","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenstructure techniques for 2-D angle estimation with uniform circular arrays","sourcePdf":"00317861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04454S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"378","articleId":"317861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317864,"authors":[{"name":"R.

When a real-time implementation is aimed at, the computational complexity involved is known to represent a serious impediment. In this paper, an ESPRIT-type algorithm is developed, which is fully adaptive and therefore particularly suited for real-time processing. Furthermore, a systolic array is described, which allows the processing of incoming data at a rate which is independent of the problem size. The algorithm is based on orthogonal transformations only. Estimates are computed for the angles of arrival, as well as for the source signals. Our aim is not so much to develop yet another ESPRIT-type algorithm but rather to show that it is indeed possible to develop an algorithm that is fully parallel and adaptive. This is something that has not been done before.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.317865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7659","startPage":"2439","endPage":"2448","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7659/00317865.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel and adaptive high-resolution direction finding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallel and adaptive high-resolution direction finding","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4782867","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel and adaptive high-resolution direction finding","sourcePdf":"00317865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051239S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","articleId":"317865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":317867,"authors":[{"name":"E.N.

Recently efficient implementations of the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm and the constrained recursive least squares (CRLS) algorithm based on the numerically stable QR decomposition (QRD) have been of great interest. Several papers have proposed modifications to the rotation algorithm that circumvent the square root operations and minimize the number of divisions that are involved in the Givens rotation. It has also been shown that all the known square root free algorithms are instances of one parametric algorithm. Recently, a square root free and division free algorithm has also been proposed. In this paper, we propose a family of square root and division free algorithms and examine its relationship with the square root free parametric family. We choose a specific instance for each one of the two parametric algorithms and make a comparative study of the systolic structures based on these two instances, as well as the standard Givens rotation. We consider the architectures for both the optimal residual computation and the optimal weight vector extraction. The dynamic range of the newly proposed algorithm for QRD-RLS optimal residual computation and the wordlength lower bounds that guarantee no overflow are presented. The numerical stability of the algorithm is also considered. A number of obscure points relevant to the realization of the QRD-RLS and the QRD-CRLS algorithms are clarified. Some systolic structures that are described in this paper are very promising, since they require less computational complexity (in various aspects) than the structures known to date and they make the VLSI implementation easier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4782869","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"9","displayDocTitle":"A class of square root and division free algorithms and architectures for QRD-based adaptive signal processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of square root and division free algorithms and architectures for QRD-based adaptive signal processing","sourcePdf":"00317867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029307S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","articleId":"317867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":317868,"authors":[{"name":"Zengjun Xiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Zengjun Xiang","id":"37345847400"},{"name":"Guangguo Bi","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Guangguo Bi","id":"37280818800"},{"name":"Tho Le-Ngoc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Tho Le-Ngoc","id":"37271236200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"317868","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":115},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the behaviors of polynomial perceptrons and introduces a fractionally spaced recursive polynomial perceptron with low complexity and fast convergence rate. The nonlinear mapping ability of the polynomial perceptron is analyzed. It is shown that a polynomial perceptron with degree L(/spl ges/4) satisfies the Stone-Weierstrass theorem and can approximate any continuous function to within a specified accuracy. Moreover, the nonlinear mapping ability of a polynomial perceptron with degree L is similar to that of the three-layer perceptron with one hidden layer for time same number of neurons in the input layer. The nonlinear mapping ability of the fractionally spaced recursive polynomial perceptron is also presented. Applications of polynomial perceptrons for fading channel equalization and co-channel interference suppression in a 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation receiver system are considered. Computer simulations are used to evaluate and compare the performance of polynomial perceptron (PP) and fractionally spaced bilinear perceptron (FSBLP) with that of the synchronous decision feedback multilayer perceptron (SDFMLP), fractionally spaced decision feedback multilayer perceptron (FSDFMLP), and the conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The results show that the performance of the fractionally spaced bilinear perceptron is clearly superior to that of the other structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7659/00317868.pdf","startPage":"2470","endPage":"2480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.317868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.317868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial perceptrons and their applications to fading channel equalization and co-channel interference suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Fading","Multilayer perceptrons","Decision feedback equalizers","Convergence","Neurons","Application software","Interchannel interference","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","telecommunication channels","equalisers","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","signal processing","polynomials","fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channel equalization","co-channel interference suppression","fast convergence rate","fractionally spaced recursive polynomial perceptron","low complexity","nonlinear mapping","Stone-Weierstrass theorem","continuous function","16-level QAM receiver","quadrature amplitude modulation","computer simulations","performance evaluation","fractionally spaced bilinear perceptron","synchronous decision feedback multilayer perceptron","fractionally spaced decision feedback multilayer perceptron","decision feedback equalizer","DFE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial perceptrons and their applications to fading channel equalization and co-channel interference suppression","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4782870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial perceptrons and their applications to fading channel equalization and co-channel interference suppression","sourcePdf":"00317868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038895S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","articleId":"317868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":317874,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The probabilistic approaches have largely supplanted methods based on comparisons of long-term feature averages. The probabilistic approaches have an important and basic dichotomy into nonparametric and parametric probability models. Nonparametric models have the advantage of being potentially more accurate models (though possibly more fragile) while parametric models that offer computational efficiencies and the ability to characterize the effects of the environment by the effects on the parameters. A robust speaker-identification system is presented that was able to deal with various forms of anomalies that are localized in time, such as spurious noise events and crosstalk. It is based on a segmental approach in which normalized segment scores formed the basic input for a variety of robust 43% procedures. Experimental results are presented, illustrating 59% the advantages and disadvantages of the different procedures. 64%. We show the role that cross-validation can play in determining how to weight the different sources of information when combining them into a single score. Finally we explore a Bayesian approach to measuring confidence in the decisions made, which enabled us to reject the consideration of certain tests in order to achieve an improved, predicted performance level on the tests that were retained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/79.317924","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/7660/00317924.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.317924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","startPage":"18","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Text-independent speaker identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Text-independent speaker identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317924/","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798789","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Text-independent speaker identification","sourcePdf":"00317924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044634S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"202","articleId":"317924","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":317925,"authors":[{"name":"Y.K.

It currently consists of spontaneous and fixed-vocabulary utterances in 11 languages: English, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, Tamil, and Vietnamese. These utterances were produced by 90 native speakers in each language over real telephone lines. Language identification is related to speaker-independent speech recognition and speaker identification in several interesting ways. It is therefore not surprising that many of the recent developments in language identification can be related to developments in those two fields. We review some of the more important recent approaches to language identification against the background of successes in speaker and speech recognition. In particular, we demonstrate how approaches to language identification based on acoustic modeling and language modeling, respectively, are similar to algorithms used in speaker-independent continuous speech recognition. Thereafter, prosodic and duration-based information sources are studied. We then review an approach to language identification that draws heavily on speaker identification. Finally, the performance of some representative algorithms is reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/79.317925","startPage":"33","endPage":"41","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/7660/00317925.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.317925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reviewing automatic language identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Speech recognition","Humans","Delay","Frequency","Telephony","Auditory system","Loudspeakers","Displays","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural languages","speech recognition","acoustic signal processing","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic language identification","Oregon Graduate Institute","OGI-TS","Multi-language Telephone Speech Corpus","language identification research","English","Farsi","French","German","Hindi","Japanese","Korean","Mandarin","Spanish","Tamil","Vietnamese","speaker-independent speech recognition","speaker identification","speech recognition","speaker recognition","language modeling","acoustic modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317925/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Reviewing automatic language identification","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4798790","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reviewing automatic language identification","sourcePdf":"00317925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060062S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"151","articleId":"317925","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":317956,"authors":[{"name":"Jyhfong Lin","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Research and the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Jyhfong Lin","id":"37383827500"},{"name":"Wing-Hung Ki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles,  Micro Linear Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Wing-Hung Ki","id":"37269638700"},{"name":"T.

SC circuits are well suited for this application since the dilation constant across different scales of the transform can be precisely implemented and controlled by both the capacitor ratios and the clock frequency. The hardware implementations are made possible by several new circuit designs. Specifically, extremely area-efficient designs are presented to implement very large time-constant filters used to process speech and other acoustic signals. The designs employ a charge differencing technique to reduce significantly the capacitance spread ratios needed in the filter banks. Also, a parasitic-insensitive sum-gain amplifier is designed which samples several inputs at the same phase. The proposed circuits have been fabricated using a 2 /spl mu/m CMOS n-well process with double polysilicon and double metal. In addition, a 32-channel prototype filter bank (each channel is a 6th order transfer function), covering a frequency range from 0.2 to 6.4 kHz which includes 36 biquads, 32 sum-gain amplifiers and a preemphasis highpass filter, is implemented on a 4.6/spl times/6.8 mm/sup 2/ die. The IC measurement results of the proposed circuits and the filter bank show the advantages of such new designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/7661/00317956.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog VLSI implementations of auditory wavelet transforms using switched-capacitor circuits","doi":"10.1109/81.317956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.317956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=317956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/317956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analog VLSI implementations of auditory wavelet transforms using switched-capacitor circuits","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798873","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog VLSI implementations of auditory wavelet transforms using switched-capacitor circuits","sourcePdf":"00317956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036386S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"33","articleId":"317956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":317960,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The question is whether the same success can be achieved for more than one objective function using the basic PID controller, while preserving its simplicity for use by an operator. Here the authors explore the use of multiobjective optimization for the purpose of extending PID controllers to applications that require the optimization of multiple objectives. An algorithm is implemented that runs in real-time and provides immediate feedback to a process operator about the current operating point. It was applied to the tuning of a PID controller to meet multiple objectives for the plastication phase of an injection molding process.

We develop bounds on the size of such \"variable weight\" OOC's and demonstrate construction techniques for building them. Furthermore, we provide an analysis to the performance of variable weight, OOC's in a CDMA network. The results demonstrate that it is possible to assign codewords with different weights among the users. Changing the weight of a user's signature sequence affects that user's performance; therefore this approach is useful for CDMA fiber optic networks with multiple performance requirements among the users.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

However, it also reduces the degree of capacity sharing and thus, increases the call blocking rate. We consider the following problem: given a network topology, link capacity of each physical link and traffic requirement of each origin-destination pair, we want to jointly determine the following four design variables: (1) the pairs of nodes that should have virtual paths, (2) the route of each virtual path, (3) the bandwidth assigned to each virtual path, and (4) the routing assignment for each virtual circuit (call), to minimize the expected call blocking rate subject to call set-up time constraints, or, alternately, to minimize the call set-up delay subject to the expected call blocking rate constraints. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear nondifferentiable combinatorial optimization problem. We also present simplified formulations for networks with abundant capacity or with limited capacity (two special cases of the general problem). Algorithms for solving the two special cases are proposed and implemented. We present computational results and make comparisons of different schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318043","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

The model predicts the signal for both the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS cases. For non-LOS paths, rays that are diffracted at the building corners, as well as reflected rays are accounted for. The results agree with available experimental data. Using this model, we show how the signal on non-LOS paths depends on the specific location of the base station. It is found that the received signal suffers 15 to 20 dB loss when the mobile turns a corner from the LOS street containing the base station into a cross street, or from a cross street into a street parallel to the LOS street.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

The analysis takes into account the presence of interchip interference due to band limitation, thermal noise, synchronous and asynchronous interferers. The analysis is then validated by extensive simulations. The system being considered is the BLQS-CDMA (band limited quasi synchronous CDMA) proposed by ESA, where all users are synchronous at chip level, but the analysis is applicable to any CDMA system.

One promising way to improve simulation efficiency is to make use of improved importance sampling (IIS). This technique is based on a translation of the original probability density of the noise process in order to generate more errors and weighting these errors afterwards. This yields a BER estimate with the same variance for a reduced number of simulation runs. In this paper, the application of IIS is made to CDMA-like multi-user systems over multipath fading channels. In contrast to classical CDMA, these broadband systems achieve a certain degree of orthogonality between the users thus allowing an enhanced spectral efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318098","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

So far, practical systems have used power control to combat the near/far effect. Another approach, still in the research stage, is multiuser detection. In addition to mitigating the near/far effect, multiuser detection has the more fundamental potential of significantly raising capacity by cancelling multiple access (co-channel) interference. There are serious complexity and implementation issues associated with optimal schemes and also with many suboptimal schemes. We analyze a simple interference cancellation (IC) scheme intended to work with power control and related requirements. The IC scheme operates by successively cancelling user interferences ranked in order of received powers. The ranking is obtained from correlations of each user's chip sequence with the received signal. This is in contrast to an alternative method of ranking based on channel estimates. It is shown that the two methods obtain similar BER performance when channel estimates of the power of each bit have relative errors of around 1 dB if 10 bits are averaged in the correlation method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00318102.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

A reliable transport protocol is responsible for end-to-end data integrity, and will retransmit lost or errored data. Compared to a link over copper or fiber, a wireless link will have a much higher error rate. Link-layer retransmissions can reduce the error rate on the radio link, but the interaction of link-layer retransmission with end-to-end retransmission can be complicated. The authors have investigated, via analytic, numerical and simulation techniques, the end-to-end effects of link-layer retransmissions in the presence of a reliable end-to-end transport protocol. The results identify the mechanisms affecting end-to-end performance when retransmissions are used to get better error performance on a link. They quantify the increased load on the link due to competing retransmission strategies, and, for a transport protocol modeled on TCP, they identify the region of loss rates where link-layer retransmissions have the undesirable effects of both reducing end-to-end throughput and increasing link utilization in the network segment where bandwidth is the most expensive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput performance of transport-layer protocols over wireless LANs","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

The queueing process is simulated with real video traffic. Two key concepts are explored. First, input traffic in the low frequency band stays intact as it travels through a finite-buffer zero-loss system. Second, the link capacity requirement at each node is essentially captured by its low frequency input traffic (filtered at a properly selected cut-off frequency). Hence, one may overlook the queueing process at each node for network-wide traffic flow in the low frequency band. The authors propose a simple, effective method for link capacity allocation and network control using on-line observation of traffic flow in the low frequency band. The experimental study points out a possible new direction for control of high speed networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318180","pdfPath":"/iel2/1047/7666/00318180.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"750 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

Analytical optimization techniques are generally ineffective, especially for queueing networks with bursty traffic. The authors present two stochastic gradient optimization techniques that lead to favorable IS parameter settings in the simulation of queueing networks, including queues with bursty traffic. Namely, they motivate and describe the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, and the stochastic (important event) frequency ascent (SFA) algorithm. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms by applying them to the problem of estimating the blocking probability for a queue with two arrival streams, a modified interrupted Bernoulli stream and a Markov modulated Bernoulli stream with batch arrivals, deterministic service times, and finite capacity K (denoted by M-IBP+MMBBP/D/1/K). Speed-up factors of 1 to 6 orders of magnitude over conventional Monte Carlo simulation are achieved for the examples presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","High-speed networks","Signal processing algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Communication networks","Velocity measurement","Frequency estimation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","optimisation","telecommunication traffic","queueing theory","stochastic processes","numerical analysis","Monte Carlo methods","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speed-up factors","Monte Carlo simulation","importance sampling","high-speed networks","underlying probability measures","modification","bias","queueing networks","bursty traffic","stochastic gradient optimization techniques","parameter settings","stochastic gradient descent algorithm","stochastic important event frequency ascent algorithm","blocking probability","arrival streams","modified interrupted Bernoulli stream","Markov modulated Bernoulli stream","batch arrivals","deterministic service time","finite capacity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318181","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

The spectrum coexistence of the two systems will improve spectral efficiency, but it will cause interference to both systems. To reduce the interference, the spread spectrum (SS) technique is used in the PCN. In addition a CDMA PCN transmitter is designed, employing filtered pseudonoise (PN) sequences, that reduce the interference to the FSM systems. The performance of the FSM under the overlaid filtered PCN is studied. Next, a CDMA PCN receiver is designed, employing filtered PN sequences, and the performance of the filtered PCN, under FSM interference, is evaluated in terms of the CDMA capacity reduction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318208","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

Lazar and Pacifici (1991) showed that traffic prediction is able to alleviate this problem. The traffic prediction model in their framework is a special case of the Box-Jenkins ARIMA model. In this paper, we propose a neural network approach for traffic prediction. A (1,5,1) backpropagation feedforward neural network is trained to capture the linear and nonlinear regularities in several time series. A comparison between the results from the neural network approach and the Box-Jenkins approach is also provided. The nonlinearity used in this paper is chaotic. We have designed a set of experiments to show that a neural network's prediction performance is only slightly affected by the intensity of the stochastic component (noise) in a time series. We have also demonstrated that a neural network's performance should be measured against the variance of the noise, in order to gain more insight into its behavior and prediction performance. Based on experimental results, we then conclude that the neural network approach is an attractive alternative to traditional regression techniques as a tool for traffic prediction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318226","startPage":"991","endPage":"995 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

Accurate characterization of the multimedia traffic is essential in ATM networks, in order to develop a robust set of traffic descriptors. Such a set is required by the ATM networks for the important functions of traffic enforcement (policing) and bandwidth allocation utilizing the statistical multiplexing gain. In this paper, we present a novel approach to characterize and model the multimedia traffic using neural networks (NNs). A backpropagation NN is used to characterize the statistical variations of the packet arrival process resulting from the superposition of a number of packetized voice sources. The NN is trained to characterize the arrival process over a fixed measurement period of time, based upon sampled values taken from the previous measurement period. The accuracy of the results were verified by matching the index of dispersion for counts and the variance of the arrival process to those of the NN output. The results reported show that the NNs can be successfully utilized to characterize the complex non-renewal process resulting from the aggregate voice-packet arrival process with extreme accuracy. Hence, NNs have excellent potential as traffic descriptors for the usage parameter control algorithm used in admission control and traffic enforcement in ATM networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Nov-2 Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318227/","accessionNumber":"4795489","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of packetized voice traffic in ATM networks using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of packetized voice traffic in ATM networks using neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00318227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033087S","chronDate":"29 Nov-2 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1047","citationCount":"14","articleId":"318227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":318228,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Two families of \"fractal\" arrival processes are presented which capture these features extremely compactly. We show the equivalence of one of these to processes with unsummable auto-correlation functions used by Leyland, Taqqu, Wilinger and Wilson (1993) to describe long term correlation and burstiness. Our approach however has advantages. The other (1 parameter) family generates burstiness on all time scales. It shows how blocking can occur even for arrival streams with zero arrival rate. This illustrates how parameters describing scaling of burstiness and correlation must replace useless long terms averages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318238","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

A link structure and a link establishment procedure are newly proposed in order to realize various broadcast communications without heavy loads. Broadcast communications, which realize point-to-multipoint communications, offer great advantages in wide area data communications, especially in satellite communications. However, conventional broadcast protocols can result in heavy communication processing loads and procedure complexity under error conditions. This makes it difficult to achieve broadcast communication that can guarantee data transfer to all receivers with efficient channel utilization. In addition to less effectiveness, these protocols cannot realize various broadcast communications. In the proposed method, the trade-off between data transfer guarantee and communication loads is solved by separating retransmission functions into two layers. Therefore, the proposed broadcast protocol can realize flexible and highly efficient broadcast communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318282","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

Sharing, a method of managing buffer resources, can be performed in a number of ways. Each sharing method has inherent advantages coupled with inherent disadvantages in terms of blocking probability, utilization, throughput, and delay. A buffer manager that can manage buffer resources in different ways, rather than one, is ideal for the wide range of uses envisioned for broadband packet switched networks.

Termination of the data helps to ensure correct decoding and reduces the effective rate of the code, especially for short data sequences. The synchronizer makes use of the symbols transmitted for termination in order to increase the probability of correct frame synchronization. The author derives an optimum decision rule and several suboptimal algorithms that considerably reduce computation and complexity. Improvement of several dB in frame sync performance was found by simulations. The technique can be applied to \"one shot\" (e.g. packet) or continuous transmission applications. Furthermore, no changes need to be made to the frame structure, only modifications of the receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318341","endPage":"1611 vol.3","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00318341.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

System bandwidths of 1.25 and 10 MHz are considered. The system capacity, the number of simultaneous users per cell, is estimated taking into account the effects of the fast power control algorithm on the multiuser interference, as well as the effects of path loss and shadow fading. Capacity is obtained as a function of path loss exponent, order of antenna and multipath diversity, and system bandwidth. Path loss exponent is seen to have a major impact on system capacity.

This algorithm was developed using COMDISCO's Signal Processing Work System. Inputs to the algorithm included the signal parameters and receiver specifications, such as Costas and symbol sync loop bandwidths and update rates. The analysis was performed for various signal-to-noise ratios and loop parameters. The bit-error rate (BER), the SSL, Costas loop tracking variances, and the receiver acquisition time results include the two-way coupling effects between the Costas loop and the symbol sync loop. To provide statistical stability, final results were generated by averaging the simulation outputs; using various random noise seeds, initial carrier phases, and symbol timings. The tracking variance and BER results were further compared to their theoretical and experimental counterparts. This comparison has shown that simulation results are within 0.25 dB of their theoretical and experimental counterparts. Based on these results, the simulation models can be used for predicting the demodulator's performance under various tracking conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of an all digital BPSK demodulator","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

The MAI is especially serious in a near-far situation where the received powers from the different users are very dissimilar, as the case might be for a cellular or personal communications system. Several near-far resistant receivers have been proposed. Most of these receivers require considerable complexity and rely on accurate side-information, such as: code and bit synchronization, knowledge of the number of users, each user's code waveform, received power and relative time-delay. In this paper we propose a new single-user single-bit receiver with relatively low complexity and which only requires chip timing information.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318354","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

Throughput and round trip acknowledgment delay (RTAD) results are presented for various vehicle speeds. The Go-Back-N ARQ (GEN-ARQ) protocol, and four different versions of the Selective-Repeat ARQ (SR-ARQ) protocol are compared. The relative performance of the different ARQ protocols is discussed. A version of the selective repeat protocol, which combines the error recovery mechanisms of GBN-ARQ. The pure selective repeat protocol and other enhancements, provides the best compromise in terms of throughput and delay performance over the range of different speeds and SNR conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318360","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

As a result, with a low processing bandwidth, the QPSK intradyne scheme allows the use of a digital demodulating circuit at the receiver. An intradyne receiver is investigated, and convolutional coding is applied to the intradyne and heterodyne receivers using the Viterbi decoding algorithm. Due to the limitation of the digital PLL used in the intradyne receiver, it has generally a poor performance as compared to the heterodyne receiver. On the other hand, as expected, the application of convolution codes on both systems largely relaxes the requirement for laser linewidths. The improved performance is mainly the result of the error correcting capability of the codes and the reduction of the laser linewidth to data bit rate ratio. With BER fixed at 10/sup -10/, by using a (2, 1) code with constraint length 11, the required laser linewidth can be relaxed by a relaxing factor 7 for the intradyne receiver and 1000 for the heterodyne receiver. For a fixed laser linewidth, the receiver sensitivities for both systems can be improved by 20 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318394","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

It has been shown previously that the relatively simple FDTS/DF provides a near optimal detection performance for runlength-constrained data storage channels. This paper introduces a design criterion for choosing tap weights for the constrained-complexity FDTS/DF, which assumes the finite impulse response (FIR) structure for its forward and feedback filters. A method to compute optimal tap weights for the forward and feedback filters is then presented for a magnetic recording channel subject to the popular minimum runlength constraint d=1. Results show that under the d=1 constraint, FDTS/DF with one-bit decision delay achieves a large performance improvement over DFE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7666","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

The main result of the analysis is that the noise at the decision points is always stationary, regardless of the time-varying characteristics of the OQAM system. However, unless the filters are ideal (bandlimited and with a square-root Nyquist-shape) and the carriers are properly chosen, the noises of different branches are correlated even in the presence of an ideal channel. Hence a vector estimate method should be used instead of the classical scalar threshold detectors. Furthermore, the intersymbol interference and interchannel interference impulse responses have been evaluated. Again, the interesting result is that both relationships are time-invariant regardless of the system parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

A basic unit of the algorithm consists of a bank of least mean square (LMS) adaptive filters and Bayesian symbol-by-symbol decision feedback equalisers (DFEs). To increase reliability, a variety of initial conditions can be covered by including several such units. The performance of each unit is monitored by examining its estimated mean square error (MSE), and those units which perform poorly can then be switched off. The nature of this blind adaptive algorithm leads to simple and efficient parallel implementation. As is demonstrated in the simulation, convergence can be achieved within a few hundred symbols when a 4-level symbol constellation is used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/1047/7666/00318417.pdf","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2021 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

In addition this system should maintain the graceful degradation as the actual analog systems, and should be compatible with the standard definition-TV (SDTV). The system compatibility can be achieved by using a hierarchical HDTV source-coding scheme that can provide at least two (HDTV, SDTV) or three (HDTV, EDTV, SDTV) hierarchy levels: SDTV image quality will be expected for portable receivers, and HDTV/EDTV image quality will destinate to stationary receivers with roof-top antennas. Taking into account the receivers antenna gains and the different channel conditions, there will be a difference of 25-30 dB between the received powers of the stationary and the portable receivers! Therefore the design of a powerful and a suitable transmission scheme for the future broadcasting of the digital HDTV signal will be a technological challenge. A transmission scheme for broadcasting a hierarchical HDTV signal in an 8 MHz terrestrial channel for stationary and portable receivers, is proposed. The system is based on a concatenated coding scheme, where the inner multilevel coding is combined with multiresolution modulation. The principle of OFDM is used to combat the multipath propagation. This combination will allow one to perform a coherent detection with a simple channel estimation algorithm, to use the available spectrum in an efficient way, to achieve high spectral efficiencies, to assume a graceful degradation, and to maintain the compatibility between the different receivers by providing different receiver complexities depending on the desired image quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318420","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

Starting from an error probability criterion, we first derive a receiver for this channel that admits a detector-estimator decomposition, has certain asymptotic optimality properties and a complexity which is horizon independent. The performance of this detector is analytically characterised and contrasted with that of the single-user (or conventional) detector as well as the optimal multiuser detector for the time-invariant CDMA Rayleigh fading channel when it is implemented over the time-varying channel. Notable among our conclusions is the fact that, unlike the time-invariant channel multiuser detector, the time-varying channel detector is able to withstand not only the estimated interference from the other system users, but also, the residual (unestimatable) interference arising out of imperfect estimation of the interferer fading parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1993.318429","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM '93.

In such a scenario, both mobiles and base stations must be able to be in motion without sacrificing system performance. To ensure uniform performance throughout each cell, an adaptive power control scheme is essential. However, even this may not be sufficient to counteract the effect of mobile cells which may \"overlap\" spatially. Here we evaluate the performance of a direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) scheme in a mobile cellular environment taking into account the effects of overlapping cells and various channel models.

Ideally, the FFT frequency band should coincide with the entire FH spread-spectrum bandwidth. However, in some practical implementations, hardware and/or real-time computational signal processing capabilities limit the FFT to a fraction of the total band of interest. In this case, the preprocessor will only intercept some of the received hops, but the FH signal can still be successfully detected assuming that enough hops are observed. If the receiver front end is tunable, an alternative approach is to step the FFT band within each hop such that more or all of the FH signal bandwidth is covered. The tradeoff is that more of the hops will be intercepted but the receiver will detect only part of each hop. This paper analyzes this partial-band FH detection scheme and determines the optimum performance strategy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Nov-2 Dec 1993","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4759656","displayDocTitle":"Partial-band detection of frequency-hopped signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial-band detection of frequency-hopped signals","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00318431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028629S","chronDate":"29 Nov-2 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1047","citationCount":"9","articleId":"318431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":318432,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Kae Tzou","affiliation":["Communication Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ching-Kae Tzou","id":"37353737600"},{"name":"R.

It is shown that the PSP characteristic of providing the channel estimators to the individual survivors with zero-delay, high-quality data-aiding sequences proves essential in a rapidly time-varying environment. We consider a Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) data frame where each user transmits a block of information symbols preceded by a known preamble and followed by a known tail. PSP-based adaptive RSSE decoders are shown to outperform conventional adaptive RSSE decoders of equivalent state complexity based on tentative decisions, when a rapidly varying channel is assumed.

Hence, noise biasing IS methods developed previously for CDMA detectors should also be appropriate for Bayesian equalizers. At low SNRs, the decision boundary far the one-shot Bayesian equalizer approaches a hyperplane. This hyperplane is viewed as an approximation to the true decision boundary at high SNRs, and can thus be used to construct an appropriate noise bias vector. With a slight modification, it is shown that the IS technique for the one-shot Bayesian equalizer can also be applied to the Abend and Fritchman (1970) recursive algorithm, and finally, to an adaptive Bayesian blind equalizer.

This work makes some theoretical contributions to the use of IS when the sampling density is a translated version of the original noise density. An asymptotic analysis is used to determine the optimum translation vector for a large class of non-linear and/or non-Gaussian systems as the probability of the event of interest goes to zero. The reduction in sample size with respect to standard Monte Carlo methods is calculated and a simple bound is derived. In addition the asymptotic optimality and equivalence of two adaptive IS algorithms at convergence is established. Numerical results are shown to be in close agreement with the developed theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Nov-2 Dec 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-2 Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4759670","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the use of improved importance sampling (IIS) in the simulation of digital communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of improved importance sampling (IIS) in the simulation of digital communication systems","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00318445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033814S","chronDate":"29 Nov-2 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1047","articleId":"318445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":318580,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The edge-element method is easily coupled to the moment method, and it doesn't introduce spurious modes. The equivalence principle is used to divide the original problem into two separate problems: an unbounded homogeneous one in which the moment method is used and a bounded inhomogeneous one in which the edge-element method is used.

In general, under some situations, the conventional Frost's (1972) beamforming algorithm may have some problems associated with performance degradation in multiple jammers environment. It causes the convergence time to be essentially dependent on the jammer powers ratio. A new hybrid adaptive beamforming algorithm is derived in the transformed domain for multiple jammers suppression. Here, three popular orthonormal transformations-i.e., discrete Hartley, discrete cosine, and discrete Fourier transforms-are considered. Overall performance improvement, in terms of convergence rate and the computational requirement, is investigated. From the simulation results, we observed that the new presented beamforming algorithm is more robust than the conventional Frost's beamforming algorithm in terms of jammers suppression and the convergence rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4797353","displayDocTitle":"The performance of hybrid adaptive beamforming algorithm for jammers suppression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of hybrid adaptive beamforming algorithm for jammers suppression","sourcePdf":"00318643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030653S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","articleId":"318643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":318649,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

Sampling theorems and computation schemes","abstract":"For part 1 see ibid. vol.47, no.9, p.1280 (1994). Two computation schemes for calculating the far-field pattern in the time domain from sampled near-field data are developed and applied. The sampled near-field data consists of the values of the field on the scan plane measured at discrete times and at discrete points on the scan plane. The first computation scheme is based on a frequency-domain near-field to far-field formula and applies frequency-domain sampling theorems to the computed frequency-domain near field. The second computation scheme is based on a time-domain near-field to far-field formula and computes the time-domain far field directly from the time-domain near field. A time-domain sampling theorem is derived to determine the spacing between sample points on the scan plane. The computer time for each of the two schemes is determined and numerical examples illustrate the use and the general properties of the schemes. For large antennas the frequency-domain computation scheme takes less time to compute the full far field than the time-domain computation scheme. However, the time-domain computation scheme is simpler, more direct, and easier to program. It is also found that planar time-domain near-field antenna measurements, unlike single-frequency near-field measurements, have the capability of eliminating the error caused by the finite scan plane, and thus can be applied to broadbeam antennas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797360","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Planar near-field scanning in the time domain .2.

Plagued by disputes concerning the suitability and performance of various competing choices for piecewise basis functions and facing horribly complicated piecewise quadratures for the construction of influence matrix elements, it has become quite commonplace for these methods to be matrix-build-time limited rather than matrix-solve-time limited. An extremely simple alternative to all this is described below and demonstrated, in an introductory sense, on some 2-D problems. In this procedure, the FFT method, the basis functions are all global Fourier series in a suitably chosen parameter, and one attempts to estimate the coefficients describing the unknown surface current directly from the integral equation. This format circumvents all of the shortcomings discussed above-there are no singular integrals to evaluate. Furthermore, since the FFT algorithm is used throughout, the computation is extremely efficient. The results shown below suggest that, so far, this approach is very effective.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.318652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.318652","endPage":"1316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7674/00318652.pdf","startPage":"1309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of Fourier series/FFT's as global basis functions in the solution of boundary integral equations for EM scattering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318652/","displayDocTitle":"On the use of Fourier series/FFT's as global basis functions in the solution of boundary integral equations for EM scattering","volume":"42","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4797362","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of Fourier series/FFT's as global basis functions in the solution of boundary integral equations for EM scattering","sourcePdf":"00318652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045493S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","articleId":"318652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":318653,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The method is based on a discrete-time switch model that consists of a constant conductance in parallel with a current source. In each simulation step, the value of the current source is updated as a function of known network signals. The function takes one of two forms, depending on the state (on or off) of the switch. Since the system matrix is constant, regardless of the states of the switches, simulation time is essentially the same as for a linear, time-invariant network of the same complexity. The paper discusses selection of the model and simulation parameters. The simulation algorithm is described and an example is included. It is shown that the method is not only efficient but also quite general and void of convergence problems. Its primary application is for long-term transient simulation of power electronic systems such as switching power converters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.318904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.318904","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/7679/00318904.pdf","startPage":"449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for fast time-domain simulation of networks with switches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318904/","displayDocTitle":"A method for fast time-domain simulation of networks with switches","volume":"9","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4798272","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for fast time-domain simulation of networks with switches","sourcePdf":"00318904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040453S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"106","articleId":"318904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":318938,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Sigma-delta modulation is used to round values to the nearest n-bit canonic signed-digit code (number representable as sum or difference of at most n powers-of-two) such that the quantization error is moved to higher frequencies. This technique can be applied to the impulse response of an FIR filter to truncate the coefficient values to a few non-zero bits; eliminating the need for multiplications. The resulting filter's magnitude response will be accurate over low frequencies and is thus suitable for narrowband lowpass applications. Sigma-delta CSD truncation is applied to previous multiplier efficient approaches for narrowband filters (prefilter-equalizer, multirate) and examples are given which show an additional 4 to 64 times reduction in computational complexity. The sigma-delta CSD interpolated FIR (SCIFIR) filter is presented and examples are given which show an additional 29%-65% reduction in computational complexity over previously reported multiplier efficient IFIR designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.318938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/7681/00318938.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.318938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient narrowband FIR and IFIR filters based on powers-of-two sigma-delta coefficient truncation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=318938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318938/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient narrowband FIR and IFIR filters based on powers-of-two sigma-delta coefficient truncation","volume":"41","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798879","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient narrowband FIR and IFIR filters based on powers-of-two sigma-delta coefficient truncation","sourcePdf":"00318938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054533S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"17","articleId":"318938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":318940,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

The major advantages of the frequency response masking approach are that the resulting filter has a very sparse coefficient vector and that the resulting filter length is only slightly longer than that of the theoretical (Remez) minimum. The system of filters produced by the frequency response masking technique consists of a sparse coefficient filter with periodic frequency response and one or more pairs of masking filters. Each pair of the masking filters consist of two filters whose frequency responses are similar except at frequencies near the band-edges. In this paper, we present three methods for reducing the complexity of the masking filters. The success of our technique is due to the fact that each pair of the masking filters can be realized as a cascade of a common subfilter and a pair of equalizers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-response masking approach for digital filter design: complexity reduction via masking filter factorization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.318940","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/7681/00318940.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.318940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7681","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=318940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/318940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-response masking approach for digital filter design: complexity reduction via masking filter factorization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798881","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-response masking approach for digital filter design: complexity reduction via masking filter factorization","sourcePdf":"00318940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064671S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"84","articleId":"318940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":318943,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This constraint is set to obtain \"regular\" wavelets. However, it is somewhat in contradiction with the usual requirement for good frequency selectivity, since it is well known that maximally flat filters (yielding Daubechies wavelets) have poor frequency selectivity. An efficient procedure for designing maximally frequency selective filter banks under a given flatness constraint is described in this paper. Classical Remez exchange algorithms, based on the alternation theorem, can no longer be used in this case. Linear programming techniques are capable of setting up constraints of this type, but require high memory storage and computation time. First, a variation of the alternation theorem adapted to this new situation is derived. Then, a modified Remez exchange algorithm for the design of \"wavelet\" filters is derived in the spirit of the Parks-McClellan algorithm. The efficiency of the algorithm is greatly improved as compared to linear programming techniques, and optimum filters are generally obtained after 3 or 4 iterations.

Late potentials are usually detected by applying a threshold algorithm to a signal-averaged and filtered QRS complex. Adaptive filtering algorithms have made it possible to attempt beat-to-beat analysis of late potentials but the standard threshold algorithm used for signal-average ECGs yield inconsistent endpoint detection. A new algorithm which uses hidden Markov modeling to represent the transitions between the QRS complex and surrounding isoelectric regions is shown to provide consistent QRS boundary detection despite variations in noise level in the range of 0-1 mu V.

An eigenanalysis based two-step adaptive method is proposed for uniform linear arrays. In the first step, an optimum subarray weight vector is obtained via eigenanalysis techniques. In the second, the adaptive array response is optimized by employing unused degrees of freedom. Two optimization criteria are minimization of white noise power and matching a desired response. The authors deals with coherent interference suppression using a sensor array of arbitrary geometry and introduce a novel concept called split-polarity transformation (SPT) which is incorporated into the conventional linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer to decorrelate the desired signal from interference. With the aid of SPT processing, the signal cancellation due to correlation between the desired signal and interference is almost eliminated.

A multistage decision process is used to extract optimal paths from an image window. These optimal paths are defined according to Phi and have a high chance of belonging to a spectral line. Then, a temporal processing integrates these observation windows to supply, after filtering, an image cleared of locally incoherent noise. Thus, the spectral line perception is drastically enhanced, even with a low signal to noise ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319119","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7684/00319119.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"320 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lofargram line tracking by multistage decision process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Lofargram line tracking by multistage decision process","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4754264","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lofargram line tracking by multistage decision process","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061198S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"13","articleId":"319119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":319123,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

The data for the problem are a noisy received waveform which consists of scaled and delayed replicas of a known transmitted signal. The problem of estimating the unknown parameters is posed as a convolution problem. A simple approach which just solves a set of linear equations is proposed for this deconvolution. The approach makes use of the special structure of the impulse response of the channel. It yields a better estimation of the channel response than the iterative method of projection onto convex sets (POCS). The connection between the proposed and the POCS method is shown. The problem that occurs when the time delays are not integer multiples of the sampling interval, which is often the case in practice, is addressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319123","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7684/00319123.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684","startPage":"333","endPage":"336 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A non-iterative deconvolution method for estimating multipath channel responses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A non-iterative deconvolution method for estimating multipath channel responses","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319123/","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4754268","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A non-iterative deconvolution method for estimating multipath channel responses","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045256S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"23","articleId":"319123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319128,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The purpose is, for a given application, to find the architectural parameters that, for a given I/O rate, minimize the on-chip memory size so as to keep the maximal part of chip area for computation. For this purpose, a general model of the architecture is proposed in which the on-chip memory size is expressed as a function of I/O rate, space-time allocation of computations onto the processing elements, vector dimension, and input and output data wordlengths. I/O optimization minimizes the memory size as a function of I/O bandwidth.

What is novel about the architecture is its data rotator, which is a hexagonal mesh of processors. The rotator is completely scalable and modular and is programmable with respect to d and the length of each dimension. The proposed architecture has an AT/sup 2/ figure of O(d/sup 2/n/sup 2/ log/sup 2/ n), where d is the dimensionality, n is the total number of elements in the data cube, and the precision of an element is assumed to be Theta (log n). The value of AT/sup 2/ for the rotator itself is O(n/sup 2/ log/sup 2/ n) for a single rotation, which is optimal. Multidimensional separable kernel transforms may be computed by performing d sets of 1-D transforms, each along a unique axis of the d-D data cube. A natural architecture for such problems consists of a number of 1-D transform processors and a rotator or transposer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319131","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7684/00319131.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"368 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systolic VLSI architecture for multi-dimensional transforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"A systolic VLSI architecture for multi-dimensional transforms","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4754276","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systolic VLSI architecture for multi-dimensional transforms","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055714S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","articleId":"319131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319132,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.

The proposed CMAC does not require the use of a separate adder module, thereby achieving a reduction of 50% in the computation time along with 20% savings in the area when compared with the conventional MACs. The CMAC, while maintaining functional as well as near total pin compatibility with the industry standard MACs, such as the ADSP1010 and TDC 1010 series, provides additional features of mixed-mode data format, saturation arithmetic logic, and on-chip test logic for the measurement of the critical path delay.

The proposed architectures consist of three stages that exhibit regular and modular structure. Trade-offs between hardware complexity and speed are achieved by applying partitioning techniques to each stage. Through a recently developed multiplierless algorithm, the convolution is reduced to the computation of a series of squaring operations. Based on this fact, a general graph-based methodology for designing circuits that perform raising to the Nth power modulo m is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319137","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7684/00319137.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic design of full adder-based architectures for convolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319137/","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design of full adder-based architectures for convolution","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4754282","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design of full adder-based architectures for convolution","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030926S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"2","articleId":"319137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319138,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Pipelining is achieved by developing recursive algorithms that have additional delays in the feedback paths, and using the delays as pipeline latches. It is shown that for two levels of pipelining, the sample period of the array and stack filter-based architectures reduces by a factor of 2; the sample period is not, however, reduced proportionately for higher levels of pipelining because of the large implementation overhead.

Two classes of hybrid architecture are proposed: the hybrid pretrace-back architecture and the hybrid trace-forward architecture. Pretrace-back is a preprocessing of the add-compare-select (ACS) decisions to increase the effective trace-back recursion rate, while trace-forward is a concurrent processing of the decisions to initialize the trace-back recursion. Both of these architectures can be implemented using a single compact memory, typically twice the survivor path length in size, without any loss in throughput compared with conventional trace-back architectures. Based on area estimates for common decoding problems the hybrid architectures reduce the required chip area by up to 40% compared with the popular k-pointed trace-back architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4758423","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid survivor path architectures for Viterbi decoders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid survivor path architectures for Viterbi decoders","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057836S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"27","articleId":"319148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319151,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Simulation results are compared with the multistage subspace technique that utilizes all of the information in the signal model. The networks are trained with examples of one signal component in noise at a specified noise level. The resulting multistage neural network is able to generalize to different noise levels and multiple signals without additional training.

Whether deconvolution or signal classification is carried out, time-frequency analysis, instead of frequency or time domain analysis alone, is required. The authors examine features derived from the Wigner distribution and its derivatives, and features derived from subband coding wavelet decomposition. Both the traditional nearest neighbor decision rule and the neural network classifiers, the backpropagation trained network and the Nestor's RCE network, are considered to classify the ultrasonic pulse echoes into one of three hidden geometrical defect classes. Neural network classifiers using features properly derived from the time-frequency analysis are shown to provide the best classification results. Although the data set employed is small, the conclusion is fairly consistent with experiments in other large data sets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319163/","accessionNumber":"4758438","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for ultrasonic NDE signal classification using time-frequency analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for ultrasonic NDE signal classification using time-frequency analysis","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042364S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"9","articleId":"319163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":319167,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One approach uses neural network secondary testing to analyze putative hits produced by a high-performance HMM wordspotter. This has provided consistent but small reductions in the number of false alarms required to obtain a given detection rate. In one set of experiments using the NIST Road Rally database, secondary testing reduced the false alarm rate by an average of 16.4%. A second approach uses radial basis function (RBF) neural networks to produce local machine scores for a Viterbi decoder. Network weights and RBF centers are trained at the word level to produce a high score for the correct keyword hits and a low score for false alarms generated by nonkeyword speech. Preliminary experiments using this approach are exploring a constructive approach which adds RBF centers to model nonkeyword near-misses and a cost function which attempts to maximize directly average detection accuracy over a specified range of false alarm rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319181/","accessionNumber":"4758456","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid neural-network/HMM approaches to wordspotting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid neural-network/HMM approaches to wordspotting","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044198S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"11","articleId":"319181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":319184,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

In dealing with practical classification applications where significant overlap may exist between categories, special care is needed to cope with the marginal training patterns. For these situations, a soft decision is more appropriate. This motivates a fuzzy-decision neural network (FDNN) which incorporates a penalty criterion into the DBNNs. Following B. H. Juang and S. Katagiri, a penalty function is proposed which treats the errors with equal penalty once the magnitude of error exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretically, the FDNNs are less biased and they yield the minimum error rate when the number of the training patterns is very large. Simulation results confirm that the FDNN works more effectively than the DBNN when the training patterns are not separable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319184","startPage":"577","endPage":"580 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7684/00319184.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-decision neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Error analysis","Solid modeling","Gaussian noise","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","digital simulation","errors","fuzzy logic","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision-based neural network","classification","soft decision","fuzzy-decision neural network","penalty function","minimum error rate","training patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-decision neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","accessionNumber":"4758459","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-decision neural networks","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043644S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"2","articleId":"319184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":319185,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In fact, the control input binary digits status can be considered as the presence/absence of a posteriori defined binary phonetic features, forcing the network to produce a low prediction error on pairs of speech frames. Major improvements of the technique have been found after normalization of the output vector components by the prediction error standard deviations. Other improvements arise from the extension to a second order prediction, and an appropriate pruning of the allowed control states transition matrix. Rewiring of the original architecture as a recurrent network allows for the resynthesis of smooth spectral trajectories, once the recurrent network is fed by the optimal control sequence found by dynamic programming when matching real speech against the HCNN control input.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319191","startPage":"605","endPage":"608 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7684/00319191.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic hidden control neural network for modelling of the speech process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319191/","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic hidden control neural network for modelling of the speech process","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4758466","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic hidden control neural network for modelling of the speech process","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085223S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"2","articleId":"319191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319193,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

The restoration consists of two steps: estimation of the parameter of the neural network and reconstruction of the image. In the first step, the neural network is modified so that the neuron states can represent the image gray level directly. In the second step, the energy function minimization procedure is modified to get the maximum approach. The restoration performance and stability of the method are evaluated by applying it to simulated images and clinical studies acquired with a gamma camera.

Image compression is performed in three steps. First, the image is decomposed at different scales, using the wavelet transform, to obtain an orthogonal wavelet representation of the image. Second, the wavelet coefficients are divided into vectors, which are projected onto a subspace using a neural network. The number of coefficients required to represent the vector in the subspace is less than the number of coefficients required to represent the original vector, resulting in data compression. Finally, the coefficients which project the vectors of wavelet coefficients onto the subspace are quantized and entropy coded. The advantages of various quantization schemes are discussed. Using these techniques, a 32 to 1 compression at peak SNR of 29 dB was obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319199/","accessionNumber":"4758474","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Combining neural networks and the wavelet transform for image compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining neural networks and the wavelet transform for image compression","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02701S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"14","articleId":"319199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":319200,"authors":[{"name":"A.

They propose a multiresolution analysis of the images to be classified and use of feedforward neural networks to classify the images at various lower resolutions. This approach results in a major reduction of the networks' interconnection weights as well as the required learning times. The proposed approach is applied first to the images of the lowest resolution; if the classification results are not acceptable, it is successively repeated to the next images of higher resolution. A neural network architecture which incorporates most of the interconnection weights already computed at the lower level (i.e., the knowledge already acquired by the network of the previous resolution level) is proposed for this purpose. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed multiresolution classification procedure in a real life application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319200","startPage":"641","endPage":"644 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7684/00319200.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient image classification using neural networks and multiresolution analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image classification","Neural networks","Multiresolution analysis","Image resolution","Multi-layer neural network","Finite impulse response filter","Signal resolution","Feature extraction","Image recognition","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","image recognition","knowledge acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification strategy","multiresolution analysis","feedforward neural networks","interconnection weights","learning times","neural network architecture","efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Efficient image classification using neural networks and multiresolution analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","accessionNumber":"4758475","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient image classification using neural networks and multiresolution analysis","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044757S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"6","articleId":"319200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":319215,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The aim is to secure channel robustness while allowing for efficient design, storage, and handling of the vector quantizer. The general procedure is exemplified by the task of spectral coding for speech transmission. Using an LSP (line spectrum pair)-representation for the spectrum, it is demonstrated that short block codes are feasible, thus allowing for compact storage of the code-book. These short block codes combine low quantization noise in clear channel conditions with robustness to bit errors introduced by a noisy channel. A reduced length code offers the possibility of obtaining a vector quantizer. The block code structure of the code vector generation may also be exploited for efficient search of the code-book.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4758481","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Robust vector quantization in spectral coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust vector quantization in spectral coding","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037431S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"15","articleId":"319216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319226,"authors":[{"name":"W.

They identified several noisy locations such as the cafeteria and a secretary's office and included a relatively quiet office for comparison. They recorded isolated-word training and test data from one male and one female speaker at different locations employing several varieties of microphones. A typical experiment consisted of designing a speaker-independent HMM (hidden Markov model) system with one set of training data and decoding the test data collected at all locations. It was found that microphone characteristics had a significant impact on the robustness of the system. It was also observed that controlled contamination of the quiet training data with ambient noise improved the noise immunity of the recognizer, discounting the role of the Lombard effect in the studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4758496","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"Influence of background noise and microphone on the performance of the IBM Tangora speech recognition system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of background noise and microphone on the performance of the IBM Tangora speech recognition system","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037725S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"11","articleId":"319233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319239,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.L.

A stressed speech source generator framework is formulated to achieve robust speech parameter characterization using a morphological constrained enhancement algorithm and stressed source compensation which is unique for each source generator across a stressed speaking class. An estimated source generator class sequence allows noise parameter enhancement and stress compensation schemes to adapt to changing speech generator types. A phonetic consistency rule is also employed based on input source generator partitioning. Average recognition rates for noisy stressful speech are shown to increase from an average 36.7% for a baseline recognizer to 74.7% for the new recognition algorithm. The new algorithm is also more consistent under varying noisy conditions as demonstrated by a decrease in standard deviation of recognition from 21.1 to 11.9, and a reduction in confusable word-pairs under noisy, stressed speaking conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4758502","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive source generator compensation and enhancement for speech recognition in noisy stressful environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive source generator compensation and enhancement for speech recognition in noisy stressful environments","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032561S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"11","articleId":"319239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319246,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Assuming that the best features for recognition are the ones that yield the lowest classification error rate over unknown data, an overall recognizer, consisting of a feature extractor module and a classifier module, is trained using the minimum classification error (MCE)/generalized probabilistic descent (GPD) method. Although the proposed discriminative feature extraction approach is a direct and simple extension of MCE/GPD, it is a significant departure from conventional approaches, providing a comprehensive basis for the entire system design. Experimental results are presented for the simple example of optimally designing a cepstrum representation for vowel recognition. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319289","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","startPage":"275","endPage":"278 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature extraction based on minimum classification error/generalized probabilistic descent method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feature extraction based on minimum classification error/generalized probabilistic descent method","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319289/","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4770965","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature extraction based on minimum classification error/generalized probabilistic descent method","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064243S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"34","articleId":"319289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":319290,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Recognition scores obtained with a continuous-density HMM (hidden Markov model) are lower than those obtained with the proposed method. The present results show an increase in recognition accuracy for the tests on Lombard-noisy speech when the training is done on clean, Lombard, and Lombard-noisy speech. Furthermore, if the same noise is used for the training and the test, the STNN performances improve far more than those of the HMM. The STNN method does not need any precise detection of word boundaries.

The basic HMM structure is extended to accommodate recurrent neural networks which transform the input observations before they enter the Gaussian output distributions associated with the states of the HMM. During training the parameters of both the HMM and the RIT are simultaneously optimized according to the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion.

Kohonen et al. (Inf. Sci. vol.33, p.3-30 of 1984). The redundant hash addressing method cannot be used for continuous speech recognition because the word boundary in continuous speech is not known. Kohonen's method has been extended to continuous speech recognition. The proposed method spots words from the input speech using information about locations of features in reference patterns. The combination of this method and an ordinary parser makes a speech recognition system faster. Experimental results are shown, comparing this method with the continuous-DP matching method, a traditional word spotting method. While the proposed method gives performance comparable with that of continuous-DP matching, it is five times faster.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319296","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319296.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"302 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new word pre-selection method based on an extended redundant hash addressing for continuous speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319296/","displayDocTitle":"A new word pre-selection method based on an extended redundant hash addressing for continuous speech recognition","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4770971","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new word pre-selection method based on an extended redundant hash addressing for continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058089S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"3","articleId":"319296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319297,"authors":[{"name":"M.

No language models are used, so that the performance of the unit models themselves can be compared. Simulated annealing and random search are applied to several components of the system, including phoneme model topologies, distribution tying, the clustering of allophonic contexts, and the sizes of mixture densities. By using knowledge of the speech problem to constrain the search appropriately, both reduced numbers of parameters and better phoneme recognition are obtained, as experimentally demonstrated on the TIMIT corpus. The clusters developed here automatically introduced a useful degree of generalization. The performance increase was preserved when the allophone distributions were tied to parallel transitions in a small context-independent model set. In this way models for phoneme classes can be built with which upper bounds for scores of detailed phoneme models can be obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319297.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"306 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using search to improve hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Topology","Context modeling","Speech recognition","Testing","Simulated annealing","Computer science","Art","Optimization methods","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalisation (artificial intelligence)","hidden Markov models","search problems","simulated annealing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","hidden Markov models","randomized performance-based search strategies","speaker-independent automatic speech recognition system","performance","phoneme model topologies","distribution tying","mixture densities","TIMIT corpus","clusters","generalization","allophone distributions","parallel transitions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Using search to improve hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4770972","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using search to improve hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033732S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"1","articleId":"319297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319298,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The algorithm incrementally applies all available acoustic and linguistic information in three search phases. Phase one is a left-to-right Viterbi beam search that produces word end times and scores using right context between-word models with a bigram language model. Phase two, guided by results from phase one, is a right-to-left Viterbi beam search that produces word begin times and scores based on left context between-word models. Phase three is an A* search that combines the results of phases one and two with a long-distance language model. The objective is to maximize the recognition accuracy with a minimal increase in computational cost. With the decomposed, incremental, search algorithm, it is shown that early use of detailed acoustic models can significantly reduce the recognition error rate with a negligible increase in computational cost. It is demonstrated that the early use of detailed knowledge can improve the word error bound by at least 22% for large-vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4770973","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"An improved search algorithm using incremental knowledge for continuous speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved search algorithm using incremental knowledge for continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03487S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"22","articleId":"319298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319299,"authors":[{"name":"M.-Y.

A decision tree is built for each individual Markov state of each phone, and the leaves of the trees constitute the senone codebook.

The proposed method was found to perform well for SNRs better than 10 dB, while for lower SNRs its performance was superior to that of spectral subtraction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319312","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319312.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319312","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"359","endPage":"362 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech enhancement using psychoacoustic criteria","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement using psychoacoustic criteria","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319312/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4770986","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement using psychoacoustic criteria","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024987S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"31","articleId":"319312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319317,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

A novel combined speech extrapolation and error detection algorithm is presented which can improve the speech significantly in the case of residual bit errors. This algorithm, which is part of the speech decoding process, uses a posteriori probabilities of speech parameters. With the extracted a posteriori probability, optimum estimators adapted to human perception can be applied and soft decision information can be exploited fully. In terms of perceptual performance, the MS (mean-square) estimator is superior to the MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimator. The method was tested under realistic conditions using an 8-kbit/s CELP (code excited linear prediction) codec.

It is shown that if the VQ is regarded as a transform of the hypercube spanned by the code words, the optimal index assignment for a full entropy encoder is the assignment that yields the most linear transform of the hypercube. Two fast and reliable methods of evaluating the inherent structure of a robust VQ without explicit knowledge about the training or the source are presented. The validity of the linearity measurement for encoders without full entropy is discussed. The significance of the measurements is demonstrated on VQs trained on speech and on synthetic sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319330","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319330.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319330","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"423","endPage":"426 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How good is your index assignment?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"How good is your index assignment?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319330/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771002","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How good is your index assignment?","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028278S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"17","articleId":"319330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319332,"authors":[{"name":"J.

They perform word spotting experiments using telephone quality conversational speech from the Switchboard corpus to examine the effect of different design choices for the three components and demonstrate that the proposed approach provides superior performance to previously used techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phonetic training and language modeling for word spotting","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319340","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319340.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"462 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Phonetic training and language modeling for word spotting","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phonetic training and language modeling for word spotting","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044915S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"25","articleId":"319340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":319342,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The first area is the potential viability of task-independent (TIND) training in wordspotting. It has been demonstrated that good task independent performance can be obtained using large, phonetically rich speech corpora for training triphone subword acoustic models. The effect of TIND training corpus size on task-dependent (TDEP) performance has been demonstrated. The second area of research was motivated by the fundamental limitation of TIND performance that exists when using fixed acoustic units. It was found that for even very large TIND corpora, the coverage of TDEP triphones will always be limited, thus demonstrating the need for a technique for learning a suitable acoustic subword unit for the particular task. The use of allophone decision trees for identifying acoustic units in a TIND wordspotter training scenario has been investigated. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that, by expanding keywords using allophones obtained from a TIND allophone clustering procedure, significant improvement in TDEP wordspotting performance can be obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00319342.png","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319342.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"470 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task independent wordspotting using decision tree based allophone clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Hidden Markov models","Vocabulary","Government","Context modeling","Training data","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","speech recognition","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task-independent training","decision tree based allophone clustering","wordspotting","performance","triphone subword acoustic models","training corpus","fixed acoustic units","learning","allophone decision trees"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Task independent wordspotting using decision tree based allophone clustering","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771013","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task independent wordspotting using decision tree based allophone clustering","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092689S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"3","articleId":"319342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":319344,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The authors first discuss the choice of sublexical units they made for a Spanish continuous speech decoder. The goal was to build a general, vocabulary-independent, speaker-independent Spanish continuous speech phonetic decoder with only sublexical knowledge. For this purpose, a corpus of 1700 Spanish sentences uttered by ten speakers was used. In addition, different approaches to the Viterbi-based reestimation procedure were considered in the framework of semicontinuous hidden Markov modeling. These simple and less complex computational approaches allow the codebook to be updated in the training phase and make it possible to obtain better decoding results than with the discrete hidden Markov model, mainly in speaker-independent experiments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319355.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"518 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spanish phone recognition using semicontinuous hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech","Decoding","Computational efficiency","Mathematical model","Proposals","Viterbi algorithm","Context modeling","Natural languages","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","parameter estimation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phone recognition","acoustic-phonetic decoders","sublexical units","Spanish continuous speech decoder","corpus","Viterbi-based reestimation procedure","semicontinuous hidden Markov modeling","codebook","training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Spanish phone recognition using semicontinuous hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771025","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spanish phone recognition using semicontinuous hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096332S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"1","articleId":"319355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319368,"authors":[{"name":"C.-H.

It is shown that the seed models required to construct prior densities to obtain the MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimate can be a speaker-independent (SI) model, a set of female and male models, or even a task-independent acoustic model. Speaker-adaptive training algorithms are shown to be effective in improving the performance of both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent speech recognition systems. The segmental MAP estimation formulation is used to perform adaptive acoustic modeling for speaker adaptation applications. Tested on an RM (resource management) task, it was found that supervised speaker adaptation based on two gender-dependent models gave a better result than that obtained with a single SI seed.

A speech recognition system usually uses a heuristic search technique such as a beam search technique requiring a large number of phoneme verifications to achieve optimal search. To reduce this verification overhead and speed up the recognition process, a trainable adaptive search algorithm controlled by a neural network using observable features is introduced. This framework has the potential to improve automatically and dynamically the search mechanism by a neural network training procedure.

It takes a further step in modeling the basic speech recognition units by directly applying discriminative analysis to string level acoustic model matching. One of the advantages of this training algorithm lies in its ability to model strings which are competitive with the correct string but are unseen in the training material. The robustness and acoustic resolution of the unit model set can therefore be significantly improved. Various experimental results have shown that significant error rate reduction can be achieved using this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319394","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7685/00319394.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"655 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum error rate training based on N-best string models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319394/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum error rate training based on N-best string models","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771060","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum error rate training based on N-best string models","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045654S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"46","articleId":"319394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319398,"authors":[{"name":"K.T.

The spectral and cepstral signal processing techniques studied fall into a few major categories based on Fourier analyses, linear prediction, and auditory processing. The classification techniques examined are Gaussian, mixture Gaussians, and the multilayer perceptron (MLP). Results indicate that the MLP consistently produces lower error rates than the other two classifiers. When averaged across all three classifiers, the Bark auditory spectral coefficients (BASC) produce the lowest phonetic classification error rates. When evaluated in a stochastic segment framework using the MLP, BASC also produces the lowest word error rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771067","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of signal representations and classification techniques for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of signal representations and classification techniques for speech recognition","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.158918S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"12","articleId":"319402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":319405,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A quasi-stationary approximation to the optimal nonstationary input covariance process is derived and shown to exhibit negligible throughput loss compared with the optimal case, for situations of most practical interest. This accurate approximation results in efficiently computed lattice or pole-zero transmit filters. By considering the finite-impulse-response minimum-mean-square error decision feedback equalizer (FIR MMSE-DFE) as a receiver structure, it is shown that transmitter optimization results in an appreciable improvement in the decision point SNR when the output block length (N) is comparable with the channel memory. As N becomes infinite, the optimum finite-dimensional nonstationary input covariance process converges to a stationary process whose power spectrum obeys the water-pour distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4771081","displayDocTitle":"Optimal transmit for packet-based data transmission on dispersive channels with application to the FIR MMSE-DFE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal transmit for packet-based data transmission on dispersive channels with application to the FIR MMSE-DFE","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050923S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"3","articleId":"319420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319422,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Using the finite impulse response (a realistic assumption) nature of wireless channels and the cyclostationary nature of the oversampled data, a finite matrix description of the channel is derived. This structure is used to obtain channel estimates and equalizers. The procedure is called semiblind because it estimates the signal subspace blindly but gets trained on phase. This technique converges quickly and is well suited for applications where the messages are short or the channel changes rapidly such that, e.g., every frame of a TDMA (time division multiple access) system needs equalization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319422","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7686/00319422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7686","startPage":"9","endPage":"12 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractionally spaced equalization of multipath channels: a semi-blind approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractionally spaced equalization of multipath channels: a semi-blind approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319422/","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771083","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractionally spaced equalization of multipath channels: a semi-blind approach","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026591S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"8","articleId":"319422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319438,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.R.

An M-channel PR MFB reduces to J( approximately=M/2) two-channel PR FBs. Unitariness of an MFB is equivalent to the unitariness of each of the two-channel FBs. Type 1 and Type 2 MFBs are introduced. All FIR unitary MFBs are parametrized. Unitary MFBs are associated with modulated wavelet tight frames (MWTFs). All compactly supported MWTFs are parametrized.

These differ from the short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and wavelet packet tilings in that they change over time. It is shown how this can be achieved using time-varying orthogonal tree structures, which preserve orthogonality, even across transitions. One method is based on lapped orthogonal transforms, which makes it possible to change the number of channels in the transform. A second method is based on the construction of orthogonal boundary filters to construct essentially arbitrary tilings. A double-tree algorithm is presented that, for a given signal, decides on the best binary segmentation and on which tree split to use for each segment. That is, it is a joint optimization of time and frequency splitting. The algorithm is optimal for additive cost functions (e.g., rate distortion), which gives the best time-varying bases.

The AFT can be interpreted as a rotation on the time-frequency plane. An AFT with an angle of alpha = pi /2 corresponds to the classical Fourier transform, and an AFT with alpha =0 corresponds to the identity operator. The angles of successively performed AFTs simply add up, as do the angles of successive rotations. A number of properties of the AFT are given. Most important among these are the AFT's relationships with time-frequency representations such as the Wigner distribution, the ambiguity function, the short-time Fourier transform, and the spectrogram. These relationships have a very simple and natural form, which further enhances the AFT's interpretation as a rotation operator. An example of the application of the AFT to the study of swept-frequency filters is given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319481","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7686/00319481.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7686","startPage":"257","endPage":"260 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An introduction to the angular Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to the angular Fourier transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319481/","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4777638","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to the angular Fourier transform","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044329S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"34","articleId":"319481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319484,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

Kernels in this class map the sinusoidal components in the data to auto-terms of undamped sinusoids and cross-terms of damped sinusoids in the local autocorrelation function (LAF). This property allows deterministic exponential modeling of the LAF for improved spectral resolution. Using the backward linear prediction approach, the roots of the polynomial corresponding to the auto-terms and cross-terms are discriminated by their location whether they are on or outside the unit circle. An analysis of the noise in the LAF is also presented. It is shown that the cross-correlation between any two terms in the LAF is zero. It is also shown that the autocorrelation function of the terms produced by the interaction of the signal and the noise components in the data has the same form as the noise-free LAF, but with a different kernel.

This algorithm converts the DCT/IDCT into convolution form such that one can easily implement it with technologies that are well suited for doing convolutions. This is an efficient and effective approach as it can avoid complicated data routing and data management. For example, there is no address generation problem and a simple pipeline structure can be applied to achieve parallel processing. Compared with conventional algorithms, this algorithm is much more flexible as it can be applied to realize DCT/IDCT with any length. This algorithm also suggests an efficient approach for realizing a unified hardware for the implementation of both the DCT and the IDCT. The realization for both the DCT and the IDCT can rely on the same convolution module.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7686/00319489.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"280 vol.3","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized approach for the realization of discrete cosine transform using cyclic convolutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Chirp","Computational complexity","Arithmetic","Systolic arrays","Length measurement","Kernel","Circuits","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","inverse problems","pipeline processing","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic convolutions","discrete cosine transform","inverse discrete cosine transform","algorithm","pipeline structure","unified hardware","DCT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Generalized approach for the realization of discrete cosine transform using cyclic convolutions","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4777643","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized approach for the realization of discrete cosine transform using cyclic convolutions","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031673S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"6","articleId":"319489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":319495,"authors":[{"name":"J.

She shows that a spatial filtering can recover the transmitted signals under two conditions, namely that both the number of sensors and the number of paths be larger than the length of the intersymbol interference, which is assumed to be finite. Thereby, signal recovery is realized without beamforming, i.e. without forming a beam towards one of the paths while cancelling the others, which would require a number of sensors much larger than the number of paths. Spatial filtering is able to cancel a multipath jammer, provided that an additional number of sensors, equal to the ISI (intersymbol interference) length of the jammer, is available. The spatial filtering is obtained adaptively by a blind algorithm, the CMA, which relies on the property of the transmitted signal to have a constant modulus. Simulation results on the present spatial CMA were compared with results for a temporal single-sensor CMA. The latter failed to recover a correct signal constellation while spatial CMA succeeded, even in a noisy environment plus a jammer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319506","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7686/00319506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7686","startPage":"344","endPage":"347 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial equalization of a radio-mobile channel without beamforming using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial equalization of a radio-mobile channel without beamforming using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA)","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319506/","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4777660","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial equalization of a radio-mobile channel without beamforming using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA)","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043318S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"21","articleId":"319506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319507,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In such cases, it is important to know the set of observations that will yield the best possible reconstruction of the signal so that only the most useful data are observed. This choice of observations must be made before actually expending resources to gather the data. If the mapping from the original signal to each observed data point is known, the mapping information can be used for choosing the best combination of observations. Two selection criteria based on the observation equation are defined. Efficient methods for optimizing these criteria with respect to the combination of observations are also proposed.

The faster convergence rate of this algorithm as compared with time-domain LMS is established. The wavelet domain LMS algorithm requires only real arithmetic. In its most basic form it has a computational complexity that is higher than that of the traditional LMS technique by a factor of cN, where N is the length of the transformed vector (or sliding analysis window) and c is the length of the analysis wavelet. Other preconditioning strategies that yield a faster convergence rate for a given fixed excess mean squared error are discussed. The authors also describe low-complexity implementations of the wavelet domain LMS algorithm.

Using this method, one can derive exact bounds on the LMS step size to guarantee mean and mean-square convergence. The equation-deriving procedure is recursive and algorithmic, and a program written in the MAPLE symbolic-manipulation software package that automates the derivation for arbitrarily long adaptive filters operating on correlated data is described. Extensive computer simulations indicate that the exact analysis is much more accurate than previous analysis in predicting adaptation behavior under correlated data conditions. The results also indicate that analysis based on the commonly used independence assumption can be inaccurate in predicting the transient behavior of adaptive filters, even in slow adaptation situations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact expectation analysis of the LMS adaptive filter for correlated Gaussian input data","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319549","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7686/00319549.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"522 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Exact expectation analysis of the LMS adaptive filter for correlated Gaussian input data","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4777703","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact expectation analysis of the LMS adaptive filter for correlated Gaussian input data","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077878S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"10","articleId":"319549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319557,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

As an example of an application scenario, the adaptive beamforming problem has been chosen, where an RLS formulation has been adopted for obtaining the optimum weights. Although optimal array processors have been proposed for this problem, implementation on a generalized network affords a flexible as well as a modular and reconfigurable solution, suitable for a highly dynamic environment with changing applications and problem sizes. The parallelization issues are explored and a scheme for an efficient implementation is described. An implementation of the minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) problem on a network of DSP32C processors is evaluated. A 1024 size problem implementation is evaluated with the DSP32C as the computation engine, and it is shown that, when the number of processors in the system is constrained to be 10, near-optimal performance can be attained with four processors.

Intrinsic to each EM algorithm is a complete-data space (CDS)-a hypothetical set of random variables that is related to the parameters more naturally than the measurements are. The authors describe two generalizations of the EM paradigm: (i) allowing the relationship between the CDS and the measured data to be nondeterministic, and (ii) using a sequence of alternating complete-data spaces. These generalizations are motivated in part by the influence of the CDS on the convergence rate, a relationship that is formalized through a data-processing inequality for Fisher information. These concepts are applied to the problem of estimating superimposed signals in Gaussian noise, and it is shown that the new space alternating generalized EM algorithm converges significantly faster than the ordinary EM algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319579","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7687/00319579.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complete-data spaces and generalized EM algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319579/","displayDocTitle":"Complete-data spaces and generalized EM algorithms","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4784406","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complete-data spaces and generalized EM algorithms","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035988S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"25","articleId":"319579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":319587,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This is not possible in likelihood-based inference. The OPI rejects any hypothesis which is poorly supported by the data. This leads to the Censored Marginal A Posteriori (CMaAP) estimation policy which returns confident estimates well below the maximum likelihood (ML) thresholds. CMaAP estimation performs an alternative-free hypothesis test, thereby subsuming detection. In a multi-hypothesis environment, the procedure combines selection and estimation into a consistent framework which avoids the numerical approximations of the Bayesian evidence approach and the MDL (minimum description length) criterion. It is therefore robust in stressful regimes and affords major computational savings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Diversity reception","Maximum likelihood estimation","Signal processing","Performance evaluation","Testing","Robustness","Parameter estimation","Gaussian noise","Low-frequency noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","computational complexity","estimation theory","model-based reasoning","signal detection","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["censored marginal a posteriori estimation","detection","model-based signal processing","Bayesian marginalization","complexity","Ockham's Razor","Ockham parameter inference","selection","computational savings"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319595","startPage":"65","endPage":"68 vol.4","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7687/00319595.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A consistent, numerically efficient Bayesian framework for combining the selection, detection and estimation tasks in model-based signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A consistent, numerically efficient Bayesian framework for combining the selection, detection and estimation tasks in model-based signal processing","accessionNumber":"4784422","publicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A consistent, numerically efficient Bayesian framework for combining the selection, detection and estimation tasks in model-based signal processing","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034755S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"6","articleId":"319595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":319599,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The parametric solution for this task which maximizes the average probability of correct decision is a maximum-likelihood (ML) classifier. However, this classifier needs the exact density function of the noise, which is often unknown. The alternative undertaken here is to develop a non-parametric classifier. Its decision statistic is the location of the first zero-crossing (FZC) in the characteristic function of the received symbols. The FZC-based classifier is inferior to the ML classifier in terms of the nominal performance. However, it puts only mild technical conditions on the probability density function of the noise and does not require additional information. Analytical expressions for the performance of the FZC-based classifier are derived, and performance is compared with that of the fully-informed ML classifier. The comparison is performed by evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of symbols that are needed for the two classifiers to have the same average correct-classification rate. Overall the FZC-based decision-maker provides a robust and practical alternative to the optimal, but often impractical, ML classifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7687/00319625.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"187 vol.4","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-parametric identification of QAM constellations in noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal processing","Constellation diagram","Additive noise","Density functional theory","Parametric statistics","Probability density function","Performance analysis","Performance evaluation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","identification","nonparametric statistics","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric classifier","first zero crossing","identification","QAM constellations","quadrature amplitude modulation","additive noise","decision statistic","performance","probability density function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Non-parametric identification of QAM constellations in noise","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4784452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-parametric identification of QAM constellations in noise","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046944S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"8","articleId":"319625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319639,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The first weakness involves a zero-forcing (ZF) characteristic, where intersymbol interference is eliminated with disregard for associated mean squared error (MSE). It is shown that a minimum-MSE (MMSE) constraint can be added for signals operating in colored Gaussian noise, with only a small increase in computational complexity and with performance enhancement under certain scenarios. The second weakness involves the constraint that the signal be stationary, which fails to exploit the cyclostationary features of most communication signals (W. A. Gardner). In particular, it is shown that polyspectra-based techniques can be used with a fractionally-spaced equalizer, with attendant performance boosts in timing insensitivity (S. H. Qureshi, 1985) and damaged-spectrum restoration (W. A. Gardner, 1991). The technique decomposes the signal into stationary streams, computing the individual and joint statistics of the partitions, and then solves the optimal Wiener equation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319648/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4784475","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Polyspectra-based, blind, MMSE, fractionally-spaced equalization of a cyclostationary signal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polyspectra-based, blind, MMSE, fractionally-spaced equalization of a cyclostationary signal","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05664S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"1","articleId":"319648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":319650,"authors":[{"name":"L.

There are many physical scenarios where this may not be the case. The authors call such scenarios mixed, in that the incoming signals contain a combination of both wideband and narrowband components. They introduce a new method for performing AOA estimation using a wideband adaptive beamsummer in the presence of mixed (narrowband and wideband) signals. The method uses an adaption criterion which is a function of both the mean and variance of the beamsummer output. The method is an extension of a similar narrowband beamsummer method (ICASSP1992 vol.4, p.461-4). Simulation results are presented which compare the performance of the new criterion with the standard narrowband and wideband adaptation criteria. These results show that the new method can perform as well or better than the classical methods in terms of target resolution and angle of arrival estimator variance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7687","startPage":"348","endPage":"351 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7687/00319666.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for adaptive wideband beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new method for adaptive wideband beamforming","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4784493","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for adaptive wideband beamforming","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058067S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"2","articleId":"319666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":319670,"authors":[{"name":"G.H.

The principle sources of estimation error in such applications are the finite sample effects of additive noise and imprecise models for the antenna array and spatial noise statistics. The covariance matrix of the estimation error when all of these error sources are present is found to be the sum of the individual contributions from each component separately. This simplifying fact allows for the derivation of an overall optimal subspace weighting for a particular array and noise covariance error model.

The authors propose adding a constraint to prevent such signal cancellation. The additional constraint limits the beamformer output mean squared error to be less than a specified level for a set of likely interference scenarios and is thus a quadratic constraint. For a properly chosen constraint, it is shown that the original LCMV adaptive beamformer's signal cancellation can be reduced to an arbitrarily small level without interference cancellation degradation. This approach does not require a uniform array structure and is applicable to both broadband and narrowband signals.

In contrast to the conventional derivative constraint methods which constrain both the magnitude and phase response, the proposed method only constrains the magnitude response. Previous results for up to the second order derivatives reported by the authors have indicated that flat mainbeam responses can be generated with much more appealing sidelobe levels by use of the phase-independent derivative constraints than those generated by use of the conventional derivative constraints. The results are further generalized to cases with arbitrarily high order derivatives. The application of these phase-independent derivative constraint techniques in adaptive broadband beamforming is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4789767","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive broadband beamforming using phase-independent derivative constraint techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive broadband beamforming using phase-independent derivative constraint techniques","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03905S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"4","articleId":"319713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":319714,"authors":[{"name":"D.D.

These causes were discussed by the authors (1991), who proposed an approach, termed the projection method, to reduce the sensitivity of the beamformer performance to both types of error. An analysis is given of the expected performance of the beamformer when it is implemented either with or without using the projection method. Based on a second order Taylor series expansion of an approximate expression for the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the beamformer output, the analysis provides accurate results when either perturbation errors or sample covariance errors occur. A less accurate analysis based on a zeroth order Taylor series expansion is found to include results presented by N.K. Jablon (1986) and L. Chang and C.

Word bounding boxes of potential keywords are extracted from the image using a morphology-based preprocessor.

For each user-specified keyword, an HMM is created by concatenating appropriate context-dependent character HMMs. Nonkeywords are modeled using an HMM based on context-dependent subcharacter models. Keyword spotting is performed using a Viterbi search through the HMM network created by connecting the keyword and nonkeyword HMMs in parallel.

For each keyword, two statistical models, called pseudo-2D hidden Markov models (P2-DHMMs), are created for representing the actual keyword and all the other extraneous words, respectively. Dynamic programming is then used for matching an unknown input word with the two models and making a maximum likelihood decision. Although the models are pseudo 2-D in the sense that they are not fully connected 2-D networks, they are shown to be general enough to characterize printed words efficiently. These models facilitate a nice 'elastic matching' property in both horizontal and vertical directions, which makes the recognizer not only independent of size and slant but also tolerant of highly deformed and noisy words. The system is evaluated on a synthetically created database which contains about 26000 words. A recognition accuracy of 99% is achieved when words in testing and training sets are in the same font size. An accuracy of 96% is achieved when they are in different sizes. In the latter case, the conventional 1-D HMM approach achieves only 70% accuracy rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319752","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7688/00319752.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7688","startPage":"81","endPage":"84 vol.5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine vision for keyword spotting using pseudo 2D hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine vision for keyword spotting using pseudo 2D hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319752/","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4789793","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine vision for keyword spotting using pseudo 2D hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030206S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"22","articleId":"319752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":319760,"authors":[{"name":"O.E.

Such an interpolation can be utilized for image-data compression both in a stand-alone way and as a boundary response in a two-source decomposition scheme. Conventional linear-interpolation approaches are described first. Then, a least-squares bilinear interpolation is proposed. The major advantages of this type of interpolation for image coding are the following: reduction in the tile effect by means of the continuity constraints imposed on the reconstruction and through the noncorrelation of the residual; lower computation complexity: more effective exploitation of interblock correlation compared with traditional block-coding methods; and robustness against noise compared with standard interpolation algorithms. Experimental results show that the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is high, and that higher reconstruction quality can be obtained by an appropriate encoding of the residuals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319767","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7688/00319767.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"144 vol.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spline-like scheme for least-squares bilinear interpolations of images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319767/","displayDocTitle":"A spline-like scheme for least-squares bilinear interpolations of images","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4789808","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spline-like scheme for least-squares bilinear interpolations of images","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057133S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"8","articleId":"319767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319769,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The decomposition is obtained by filtering the signal with a sequence of increasingly selective lowpass filters with a dyadic scale progression. The wavelet coefficients are evaluated by simple subtraction of two consecutive lowpass components. The lowpass filter bank is implemented using a standard iterative multiscale algorithm. The impulse responses of the analysis filters are shown to be interpolated versions of each other. This structure is computationally very efficient; it requires a little more than one-fourth as many operations as other comparable wavelet-based algorithms. The corresponding filter bank provides a perfect coverage of the frequency domain, which results in a trivial reconstruction procedure by summation.

The algorithm is based on directional filtering in the spatiotemporal frequency domain. By using the 3-D fast Fourier transform (FFT), because of its computational efficiency, the spectrum of an object moving at constant velocity lies in several parallel planes in the frequency domain. The object's velocity is estimated by detecting the orientation of those planes. This problem can be reduced to detecting the orientation of parallel lines in the plane intersecting those planes by using direction-tuned filters. Statistical estimation is used to eliminate the uncertainty which originates from nonorthogonality of the filters.

A three-layer perceptron was used as an address-predictor with the position of the residual address being encoded. The second scheme is a vector extension of a differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) system. It exploits the inter-vector dependencies by predicting the current block of pixels. The predictive phase utilizes a three-layer perceptron while the residual blocks are vector quantized using the Kohonen self-organizing feature maps (KSOFM) clustering algorithm. The joint-optimization problem for design of the two components of PVQ was also considered. Coding results are presented for monochrome images.

Starting from a quantization table with large step sizes, corresponding to low bit rate and high distortion, one entry of the quantization table is updated at a time so that, at each step, the ratio of decrease in distortion to increase in bit rate is approximately maximized. This procedure is repeated until a target bit rate is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that, with picture-adaptive quantization tables designed by the proposed algorithm, the JPEG DCT (discrete cosine transform) coder is able to compress images with better rate-distortion performance than that achievable with conventional empirically designed quantization tables.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-constrained picture-adaptive quantization for JPEG baseline coders","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319829","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7688/00319829.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392 vol.5","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00319829.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Rate-constrained picture-adaptive quantization for JPEG baseline coders","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4789870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-constrained picture-adaptive quantization for JPEG baseline coders","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041039S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"68","articleId":"319829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319830,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A statistical model for the image which incorporates the convex Huber minimax function is proposed. The use of the Huber minimax function rho T(.) helps to maintain the discontinuities from the original image which produces high-resolution edge boundaries. Since rho T(.) is convex, the resulting multidimensional minimization problem is a constrained convex optimization problem. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation technique that is proposed results in the constrained optimization of a convex functional.

This technique, called the boundary matching algorithm, produces noticeably better results than those reported previously. It is first assumed that the displaced frame differences have no error. Then, this assumption is relaxed by proposing an algorithm (the extended boundary matching algorithm or EBMA) which can recover both the missing displaced frame differences and the missing motion vectors. The resulting images obtained using these methods and some other methods are compared. The images obtained clearly show that better image quality can be obtained by EBMA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7688/00319836.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"420 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovery of lost or erroneously received motion vectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design for disassembly","Video coding","Laboratories","Video sequences","Image coding","Motion estimation","Compression algorithms","Transform coding","Pixel","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding errors","error compensation","motion estimation","vectors","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erroneously received motion vectors","motion-compensated video coding","extended boundary matching algorithm","missing motion vectors","image quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Recovery of lost or erroneously received motion vectors","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4789877","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery of lost or erroneously received motion vectors","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051253S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"322","articleId":"319836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319837,"authors":[{"name":"S.F.

This algorithm can be applied in compositing compressed video within the network, which may take multiple compressed video sources and combine them into a single compressed output stream. The proposed algorithm convers all MC-DCT compressed video into the DCT domain and performs compositing in the DCT domain. This DCT-domain approach can reduce the required computations with a speedup factor depending on the compression ratio and the nonzero motion vector percentage. However, dropping some least-significant DCT coefficients may be necessary for the worst case of high-motion video in real-time implementations. Some issues of networked video compositing are also discussed. Another direct application of the proposed decoding algorithm is converting MC-DCT compressed video to the DCT compressed format directly in the DCT domain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to decoding and compositing motion-compensated DCT-based images","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319837","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7688/00319837.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"424 vol.5","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00319837.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to decoding and compositing motion-compensated DCT-based images","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4789878","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to decoding and compositing motion-compensated DCT-based images","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023878S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"42","articleId":"319837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319841,"authors":[{"name":"G.

He proposes a novel paradigm, based on multihypothesis expectations (MHE). Not only can conventional methods be reinterpreted as special cases at the MHE approach, but the new model suggests improved methods with provably superior performance. Blocking artifacts can be eliminated and prediction error reduced with no change in the encoder's motion search and no extra side information. The use of state variable conditioning can further enhance performance. Additional benefits are obtained when increased encoder complexity is allowable. Search algorithms and coding methods developed previously for block matching can be used with the new techniques with no change in bit-stream syntax. Mean-square prediction improvements in the range of 18% to 40% (0.9 to 2.2 dB) are obtained using MHE methods of varying complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-hypothesis motion compensation for low bit-rate video coding","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319841","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7688/00319841.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"440 vol.5","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00319841.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"Multi-hypothesis motion compensation for low bit-rate video coding","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4789882","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-hypothesis motion compensation for low bit-rate video coding","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040518S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"52","articleId":"319841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":319869,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

For decomposing images, a separable 2-D discrete wavelet transform in which emphasis is given to the horizontal and vertical directions is used. Nine-tap filters derived from biorthogonal wavelet bases are employed. The lowest-resolution subimage was encoded using a 2-D discrete cosine transform while the other subimages were encoded using TCQ for memoryless data. Excellent peak signal-to-noise ratios are obtained for encoding monochrome and color versions of the 512*512 'Lenna' image. Comparisons with other results from the literature reveal that the proposed wavelet coder is quite competitive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319871","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1051/7688/00319871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7688","startPage":"554","endPage":"557 vol.5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image coding using wavelet transforms and entropy-constrained trellis coded quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=319871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image coding using wavelet transforms and entropy-constrained trellis coded quantization","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 April 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/319871/","conferenceDate":"27-30 April 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4789912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image coding using wavelet transforms and entropy-constrained trellis coded quantization","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00319871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089515S","chronDate":"27-30 April 1993","isNumber":"7688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1051","citationCount":"17","articleId":"319871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":319882,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Given an original image, a small representative set of pixels is selected randomly. A stochastic model based on the finite normal mixture distribution identification is then used for image segmentation. A local unsupervised segmentation method based on expectation-maximization (EM) family algorithms is then used for parameter estimation, and the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) is adopted for pixel classification. The proposed bootstrap approach is compared with the classical EM family algorithms that make a deterministic sampling pixel after pixel for parameter estimation.
