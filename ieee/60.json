The method is based on a formulation that uses harmonic power spectral densities (HPSDs), using which a block-structured matrix relation between the second-order statistics of noise within a circuit is derived. The HPSD formulation is used to devise a harmonic-balance-based noise algorithm that requires O(nN log N) time and O(nN) memory, where n represents circuit size and N the number of harmonics of the large-signal steady state. The method treats device noise sources with arbitrarily shaped PSDs (including thermal, shot and flicker noises) handles noise input correlations and computes correlations between different outputs. The HPSD formulation is also used to establish the non-intuitive result that bandpass filtering of cyclostationary noise can result in stationary noise. The new technique is illustrated using an example that exhibits noise folding and interaction between harmonic PSD components. The results are validated against Monte-Carlo simulations. The noise performance of a large industrial integrated RF circuit (with >300 nodes) is also analyzed in less than 2 hours using the new method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600312","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ASP-DAC '97: Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ASP-DAC '97: Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4762/13192/00600312.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"492","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new linear-time harmonic balance algorithm for cyclostationary noise analysis in RF circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Jan 1997","displayDocTitle":"A new linear-time harmonic balance algorithm for cyclostationary noise analysis in RF circuits","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Jan. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5559029","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600312/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new linear-time harmonic balance algorithm for cyclostationary noise analysis in RF circuits","confLoc":"Chiba, Japan","sourcePdf":"00600312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089908S","chronDate":"28-31 Jan 1997","isNumber":"13192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762","citationCount":"14","articleId":"600312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":600325,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

Previous research has largely concentrated on a class of ESOP's, the Canonical Restricted Fixed/Mixed Polarity Reed-Muller form, also known as Generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) form. However, for many functions, the minimum GRM can be much worse than the ESOP. We have defined a Shared Multiple Rooted XOR-based Decomposition Diagram (XORDD) to represent functions with multiple outputs. By iteratively applying transformations and reductions, we obtain a compact XORDD which gives a minimized ESOP. Our method can synthesize larger circuits than previously possible. The compact ESOP representation provides a form that is easier to synthesize for XOR heavy multilevel circuit, such as arithmetic functions. The method successfully minimized large functions with multiple outputs. Results are also compared to the minimized SOP's obtained from ESPRESSO. Experimental results show that for many circuits ESOP's have considerably more compact form than SOP's.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600329","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ASP-DAC '97: Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4762/13192/00600329.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13192","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ASP-DAC '97: Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","startPage":"539","endPage":"544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"28-31 Jan. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Efficient synthesis of AND/XOR networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5559037","publicationDate":"1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Jan 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient synthesis of AND/XOR networks","confLoc":"Chiba, Japan","sourcePdf":"00600329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046447S","chronDate":"28-31 Jan 1997","isNumber":"13192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762","articleId":"600329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":600334,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This paper extends the proposed simultaneous placement and global routing algorithm for transport-processing FPGAs, whose objective is to minimize the routing congestion, and proposes a new algorithm, in which the length of each critical signal path (path length) is limited within a specified upper bound imposed on it (path length constraint). The algorithm is based on the hierarchical bipartitioning of the layout regions and LUT (lookup table) sets that are to be placed. Each bipartitioning procedure consists of three phases: (1) estimation of path lengths, (2) bipartitioning of a set of terminals, and (3) bipartitioning of a set of LUTs. After searching the paths with tighter path length constraints by estimating the path lengths in (1), phases (2) and (3) are executed so that their path lengths are reduced with higher priority, and thus path length constraints are not violated. The algorithm has been implemented and applied to transport-processing circuits and compared with conventional approaches. The results demonstrate that the algorithm resolves path length constraints for 11 out of 13 circuits, though it increases the routing congestion by an average of 20%. After detailed routing, it achieves 100% routing for all the circuits and reduces the circuit delay by an average of 23%.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600338","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ASP-DAC '97: Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ASP-DAC '97: Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4762/13192/00600338.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.1997.600338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13192","startPage":"569","endPage":"578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simultaneous placement and global routing algorithm with path length constraints for transport-processing FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=600338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simultaneous placement and global routing algorithm with path length constraints for transport-processing FPGAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600338/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Jan. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5552676","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simultaneous placement and global routing algorithm with path length constraints for transport-processing FPGAs","confLoc":"Chiba, Japan","sourcePdf":"00600338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059902S","chronDate":"28-31 Jan 1997","isNumber":"13192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762","citationCount":"4","articleId":"600338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":600361,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The focus is on the reverse link of a system with binary antipodal modulation and coherent detection. The results show that for a hexagonal cell geometry with path loss exponent of 4 and without any forward error correction coding, the capacity of the system is between 1.17 and 1.67 times that of the IS-95 system. Further investigation with non-idealized cell geometries and other path loss exponents shows substantial capacity improvement over that of conventional non-interference cancelling receivers. The sensitivity of the system to power control and synchronization errors is also investigated. The results also show that relaxing the power control reduces the capacity. The capacity increase over systems with interference cancelling receivers and biphase spreading is between 1.4 and 2.0 times. Chip synchronization errors of the order to be expected in a properly designed conventional CDMA system have minimal effect on performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5766228","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a reference symbol assisted multi-stage successive interference cancelling receiver with quadriphase spreading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a reference symbol assisted multi-stage successive interference cancelling receiver with quadriphase spreading","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00600369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062238S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1997","isNumber":"13227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664","articleId":"600369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":600370,"authors":[{"name":"A.

First, we derive an optimum soft-output multiuser estimation (OSOME) algorithm for asynchronous CDMA channels with white Gaussian noise (WGN). The algorithm generates a posteriori probabilities (APP) for coded bits given the received signal. This forward-recursive algorithm requires complexity and storage exponential in the number of users K and linear in the decision lag L. Second, we outline a reduced-computation suboptimal version of this algorithm (SSOME) which compares favorably in complexity and storage with multiuser soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA). Furthermore, we note that the Bayesian conditional decision feedback estimation (BCDFE) algorithm provides symbol APP estimates that can be considerably improved upon by a slight modification. We derive the modified BCDFE algorithm for whitened multiuser channels. Finally, we present simulation results of a 4-user, convolutionally coded, asynchronous CDMA system. The results indicate that the SSOME algorithm with L=K-1 achieves a 0.4-0.5 dB gain over SOVA with much greater lag (and complexity) and keeps within 0.25 dB of the OSOME algorithm. Moreover, the modified BCDFE algorithm provides a good performance/complexity tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600370","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Based on this comprehensive evaluation, an harmonized multiple access platform has been designed consisting of two modes, a wideband TDMA with and without spreading and a wideband CDMA, which is presented. Both modes are compared against UMTS criteria. In general, they can both fulfill the UMTS objectives and will form the FRAMES input into UMTS standardization.

The multi-access signals are subjected to frequency-nonselective Rayleigh multipath fading as well as lognormally distributed shadow fading and power control error (PCE) in a system employing direct sequence spread-spectrum for code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA). The receiver consists of an antenna array of ideal isotropic sensors which feeds a bank of optimum combining array processors each of which feeds a conventional matched-filter detector. Multi-access interference from outer cells is also included in the incident signal model. The performance measures are outage probability and outage-based capacity. Results show that a roughly linear relationship exists between the number of array elements and the outage-based capacity. The slope of the capacity line is referred to in the paper as the per element capacity, the capacity increase gained by the addition of a single array element. The per element capacity degrades exponentially with increasing power control error. An approximate analysis results in a simple expression for the outage probability which allows an easy numerical solution for the per element capacity.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600403","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The application to WLANs introduces two severe problems: (i) the small form factor of the equipment causes strong antenna correlation (ii) to date there are no reliable broadband diversity channel models available for the indoor environment. These problems are addressed in the paper. Our main contributions are: (1) a derivation of the average probability of error of a receiver with a correlated antenna array. This provides fresh insight into the underlying degradation mechanism. (2) Realistic quantitative performance results on the basis of channel measurements rather than channel models by emulation of a coupled dipole linear antenna array. We conclude, that a compact linear dipole array with four /spl lambda//4 spaced elements provides a satisfactory tradeoff between performance and complexity for WLANs.

Here, data is encoded by a channel code and the encoded data is split into n streams that are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the n transmitted signals. We review the performance criteria for designing such codes under the assumption that the fading is slow and frequency non-selective established in Tarokh et al. Performance is determined by diversity gain quantified by ranks and coding gain quantified by determinants of certain matrices that are constructed from the code sequences. The performance criterion is then used to design trellis codes for high data rate wireless communication. These codes are easy to encode and decode. They provide the best trade-off between data rate, diversity gain, constellation size and trellis complexity. Simulation results are provided for 4 and 8 PSK signal sets with data rates of 2 and 3 bits/symbol, demonstrating excellent performance that is within 2-3 dB of the outage capacity for these channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5766264","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Space-time codes for wireless communication: code construction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time codes for wireless communication: code construction","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00600406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058814S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1997","isNumber":"13227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664","citationCount":"24","articleId":"600406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":600411,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Large-scale penetration of such such systems into our daily lives will require significant reductions in cost and increases in capacity, benefits proper exploitation of the spatial dimension can offer. That this is certainly the case is attested to by the significant number of companies that have been recently formed to bring products based on such concepts to the wireless marketplace. The approaches range from \"switched-beam\" to \"fully-adaptive\" with the benefits provided by the various approaches differing accordingly. At the fully-adaptive end of the spectrum is spatial division multiple access (SDMA) technology. SDMA technology employs antenna arrays and multi-dimensional nonlinear signal processing techniques to provide significant increases in capacity and quality of many wireless communication systems. It is especially well-suited to the current and next generation cellular systems termed personal communications services (PCS). Antenna arrays coupled with adaptive signal processing techniques employed at base stations improve coverage, capacity and trunking efficiency allowing lower cost deployments with cells of moderate to large size. The basic principles and architecture of SDMA wireless communication systems are outlined. Experimental results obtained from systems built to these new architectural specifications are presented demonstrating the efficacy of SDMA technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5766283","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Spatial division multiple access technology and its application to wireless communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial division multiple access technology and its application to wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00600425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120188S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1997","isNumber":"13227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4664","citationCount":"24","articleId":"600425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":600429,"authors":[{"name":"X.M.

We propose a modified Elman (1990) neural network (MENN) based multiple-model power control scheme to keep the received power almost constant at the base station. Unlike the conventional \"bang-bang\" control and fuzzy control, the MENN can identify the inverse dynamical characteristics of the channel by adaptive on-line learning. The inverse channel model is then used for reverse link power control. Hence, large overshoot and long rise time can be effectively avoided. Simulations show that the fluctuation of controlled received power is satisfactory. The overshoot and channel tracking error are small.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600429","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The necessity of acquiring high resolution-high quality data as well as extensive computation time pose severe challenges to practical planning scenarios however. A number of solutions and accelerating techniques are known in literature, all of them performing quite well under certain preconditions, but are unsatisfactory when conditions change. Therefore, the basic principles of accelerating rigorous 3-D ray tracing are presented under the aspect of their impact on prediction accuracy. A software has been developed which is able to make 'intelligent' decisions with regard to the application of various accelerating algorithms and by consequence gives optimized performance in all types of propagation scenarios. Comparison with measurements shows the gain in computation efficiency as well as the achieved prediction accuracy.","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

A significant reduction in the required Eb/No resulting from the use of a hybrid diversity scheme combining the effects of space diversity and path diversity is shown. Because TDD uses only one radio frequency band and transmission diversity at the base station can be employed, space diversity is unnecessary at the mobile station and thus the mobile station can be made smaller. CDMA/TDD systems can also realize effective transmission power control with only the use of open-loop control. A single antenna and no duplexer are advantageous in CDMA/TDD for terminal size and battery life. This system is especially effective in an environment such as microcellular systems or indoor office systems where the spreading bandwidth is narrower than the coherent bandwidth, and path diversity gain by itself is small.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600443","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

It is designed to be adequate upto a 5 MHz bandwidth in order to make it easy that frequencies are allocated to carriers by multiples of 5 MHz bands and make the specification of pulse shaping filter more loose. 8 kbps CS-ACELP (conjugate structure algebraic CELP) is adopted as a main vocoder algorithm and 32 kbps ADPCM can be used. In the reverse link, the continuous pilot scheme is introduced to cope with discontinuous data transmission and to have a symmetrical H/W component to the forward link. In order to maintain the service quality with heavy signaling data, signaling activity with a dedicated signaling channel is introduced for spectrum efficiency. The user information data of upto 128 kbps can be transmitted by using QPSK data/QPSK spreading, variable spreading factor, and code pair assignment. Based on the 3.6864 Mcps system, the multiband 0.9216/3.6864/14.7456 Mcps system for multilayered cell environments is under consideration for FPLMTS.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600445","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The use of time guard-intervals to reduce CCI and ICI is vital for good performance in such channels, but is wasteful of bandwidth. The paper examines the degradation in performance due to the use of sub-optimal time guard-intervals for uncoded and coded OFDM designs. In particular, a comparison is made between the use of low-rate orthogonal convolutional codes (LROCC) and conventional high-rate convolutional codes for different time guard-intervals. It is found that LROCC codes outperform high-rate convolutional codes, particularly when the time guard-interval period approaches its optimum value.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600449","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

In IS-95 systems, closed loop power control on the reverse link comprises two parts; an inner loop and outer loop. The inner loop aids the mobile in reaching its current signal to interference ratio (SIR) target through a sequence of power up/down commands. The outer loop dynamically adjusts the target SIR so that adequate performance in terms of frame error rate (FER), the true quality measure, is achieved. The propagation conditions for different users are different. Hence, the effectiveness of the inner loop is not the same for all users. In some cases, it always comes close to the target, while in others the variability could be quite significant. The outer loop compensates for such variability by adjusting the SIR targets so that all users obtain the same performance in terms of error rate. In this work, the algorithm used for the outer loop is described. A model for the outer loop is developed and analyzed. The analytical model enables sensitivity study of the algorithm to choice of parameters. Results indicate that the target values to be set are strongly dependent on the effectiveness of the inner loop. Thus, a fixed target strategy designed for the worst case, would be inefficient and would diminish system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1997.600465","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

However, the problem is whether the same RF channels used in CDMA overlayed/underlayed macrocell and microcell structure also obtain a high capacity as in the homogeneous structure. In this study, we investigate the interference of uplink and downlink from both the microcell and macrocell under a hierarchical structure. Downlink power control scheme and two power control methods for uplink are also considered. Performance measures such as blocking probability, C/I, capacity and service hole area are also obtained by computer simulation. With downlink power control, microcellular capacity can be increased. However, combining of downlink power control for microcell and C/I uplink power control for macrocell causes the overall system capacity to significantly increase.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600468","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

In order to give proper channel characterization, a ray tracing method has been applied to a realistic environment. The large-scale received power as a function of receiver position is investigated in the presence of room furniture and a model for path-loss prediction based on the \"room partitioning\" is proposed. Moreover, due to the high absorption of materials at 60 GHz, the characterization of the room coverage has been shown to be possible by considering only 1 or 2 reflections thus allowing fast ray-tracing prediction. Finally, wideband characterization is carried out in terms of RMS delay statistics in various situations and the effects of sectored antennas are investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The scenario can have a strong influence on the value of the decay rate, specially when changes in street length or width occur; antenna radiation patterns also have a major influence on its value. If the oxygen effect is considered apart, the decay rate should range in [2.0, 2.5], but if it is taken as part of this distance dependence, then the decay rate can be taken in [2.3, 2.8] for distances up to 250 m or in [7.0, 7.5] for distances greater than 1 km, respectively for coverage and interference purposes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power measurement","Absorption","Mobile communication","Frequency estimation","Attenuation","Analytical models","Telecommunications","Transmitters","Antenna radiation patterns","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","millimetre wave antennas","land mobile radio","millimetre wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average power to distance decay rate","transmitter-receiver distance","oxygen absorption","street length","street width","antenna radiation patterns","distance dependence","coverage","interference","60 GHz band","60 GHz","250 to 1000 m"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600479","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The scenarios represent the line of sight (LOS) and non line of sight (NLOS) cases where omni-directional antennas are used for both transmit and receive sides.

There are N mobile users which share M traffic channels (N/spl ges/M), each of which is assigned a unique spreading sequence. Transmission attempts on the uplinks are made based on the busy/idle status of the M receivers, which is broadcast by the base station, every slot, on the downlink.

Both approaches exploit higher order statistics (HOS) of the received signal sampled at symbol rate. Although this class of algorithms is said to require an excessive number of samples to achieve acceptable performance levels, we demonstrate that it is possible with the eigenvector approach to blind identification (EVI) to blindly estimate realistic COST-207 channels from one GSM burst (142 samples). At a signal-to-noise ratio of 7 dB, all sample channels are identified within a normalized mean square error bound of 5 per cent.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4664/13227/00600489.pdf","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1048 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

A new criterion for frame synchronization accuracy is derived. In the following, we propose new algorithms that allow to estimate the frame start of a data packet transmitted over a noisy unknown dispersive fading channel. The algorithms are classified in data-aided and non-data aided algorithms. All techniques are successively derived from the ML criterion taking into account less and less information. Frame synchronization may be improved basing the frame start estimate on multiple frames. Solutions working under the constraint of clock inaccuracies are presented. The algorithms are compared using simulation. It is shown that a combination of power-ramp up and data-aided synchronization is best suited for asynchronous transmission. With minor modification, the algorithms may be used for multicarrier modulation as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

However, the performance of such a digital communication system strongly relies on the accuracy of synchronization. This paper investigates the system performance of digital adaptive beamforming in a digital QAM receiver in the presence of synchronization errors. The simulation results show that digital adaptive beamforming can cancel interference while simultaneously compensate for the carrier phase and frequency offset to support a reliable 64-QAM link. However, this system is very sensitive to the symbol timing error and the sampling timing offset. The system employing both ABF and adaptive equalization, which can reject interference in a multipath environment, is able to compensate for the symbol timing error and the sampling timing offset. The tracking range of the carrier frequency offset is also improved in the system with both adaptive beamforming and equalization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of synchronization errors on digital adaptive beamforming for a high bit-rate QAM receiver","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

This innovational method involves uniformly spaced triads (or pairs) of electric dipoles or magnetic loops, spaced much farther apart than a half-wavelength. An ESPRIT-based step produces arrival angle estimates that suffer cyclic ambiguity due to the extended spacing. Then, a closed-form integer search is performed over a MUSIC null spectrum for all finite number of possible direction cosines in the cyclic ambiguity using the aforementioned cyclically ambiguous estimates. This approach produces highly accurate, yet unambiguous, azimuth and elevation angle estimates. This novel method facilitates (1) multipath de-correlation (independent fading), (2) coherent summation of multipaths from the same source, and (3) down-link beamforming from the base-station to the mobile.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.600513","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Our approach uses the desired signature code and the orthogonal code to decompose the receiving signals into two parts: the desired signal and interference. The beamforming weights are blindly updated according to these two sub-spaces. Unlike the null space beamforming method, the new beamformer can handle a large number of users with a small number of antenna elements. To adapt to the time varying environment, a recursive algorithm is developed at a very low hardware complexity. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new blind recursive algorithm converges very fast and has better performance than the well known generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GED) method.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Generally, cells are grouped in a cluster of 7 (N=7). Each cluster reuses the same frequency to maximize bandwidth efficiency. To further minimize the co-channel interference from adjacent clusters, sector antennas are used. A cell is typically sectorized into three sectors (K=3) to achieve rapid frequency reuse. The deployment practices include using the N=7, K=3 or using the N=4, K=6 frequency reuse scheme. Because of the flexibility of the CDMA technology, restrictions of using the conventional clusterization and/or sectorization schemes may not be warranted. In fact, to maximize the utilization of existing resources such as cell-site equipment, structures, real-estate, backhauls, etc., employing a non-standard sectorization scheme will yield a more optimum configuration and a more cost-effective solution. We address such non-standard sectorizations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum sectorization for CDMA 1900 base stations","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

We discuss the following issues: appropriate target patterns, control over the shape of the mainlobe, and the sectorization of the field of view into neighborhoods over which prestored tapering weights (synthesized offline) can be applied.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13241/00600817.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"54 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1996.600817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.600817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=600817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Array pattern synthesis for satellite communications on-the-move","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite communication","Antenna arrays","Satellite antennas","Spirals","Transmitting antennas","Shape control","Microstrip antenna arrays","Frequency","Gratings","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile satellite communication","satellite antennas","spiral antennas","antenna radiation patterns","antenna arrays","directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["element size","array pattern synthesis","transmit beampatterns","multiband array","nonuniformly spaced spiral antennas","geosynchronous satellite communications","minimum interelement spacing","spiral elements","directional radiation patterns","synthesis methods","mainlobe shape control","field of view sectorization","prestored tapering weights","planar array","mobile satellite communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Array pattern synthesis for satellite communications on-the-move","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5697141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array pattern synthesis for satellite communications on-the-move","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00600817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029146S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"1","articleId":"600817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":600819,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

Computer simulations show that the ORMP method is superior to the BMP method in terms of its ability to select a compact basis set. However, it is computationally more complex. The MMP algorithm is developed which is of intermediate computational complexity and has a performance comparable to the ORMP method. All the sequential selection methods are shown to have difficulty in environments where the basis set contains highly correlated vectors. The drawback can be traced to the sequential nature of these methods suggesting the need for a parallel basis selection method like FOCUSS. Simulations demonstrate that the FOCUSS algorithm does indeed perform well in such correlated environments. However, a drawback of FOCUSS is that it is computationally more intense then the sequential selection methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1996.600867","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13241/00600867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.600867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13241","startPage":"252","endPage":"257 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of basis selection methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=600867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of basis selection methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600867/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5697181","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of basis selection methods","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00600867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07742S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"33","articleId":"600867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":600875,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

The problem of finding an optimal task allocation is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense. We present an algorithm for this problem, which uses the idea of branch and bound with underestimates for reducing the computations in finding an optimal task allocation. The algorithm reorders the list of modules to allow a subset of modules that do not communicate with one another to be assigned last, for further reduction in the computations of optimal task allocation for maximizing reliability. We also present a heuristic algorithm which obtains suboptimal task allocations in a reasonable amount of computational time. We study the performance of the algorithms over a wide range of parameters such as the number of modules, the number of processors, the ratio of average execution cost to average communication cost, and the connectivity of modules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms by comparing them with recent competing task allocation algorithms for maximizing reliability available in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/12.600888","startPage":"719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/13249/00600888.pdf","endPage":"724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.600888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/600888/","displayDocTitle":"Task allocation algorithms for maximizing reliability of distributed computing systems","volume":"46","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5646732","publicationDate":"June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task allocation algorithms for maximizing reliability of distributed computing systems","sourcePdf":"00600888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02601S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"87","articleId":"600888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":600928,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although this is an over simplification of a real target scenario, it is reasonable because of the presence of dominant scatterers in radar targets. The MLE convergence properties are determined by examining the shape of the associated ambiguity over range, velocity and acceleration. In addition, the Cramer Rao bound is computed in closed form which shows that the velocity bound is decoupled from the corresponding bounds of range and acceleration. A fast MLE is then proposed which uses the Hough transform to initialize the MLE algorithm.

The reviewers for each inspection were randomly selected without replacement from a pool of 11 experienced software developers. The dependent variables for each inspection included inspection interval (elapsed time), total effort, and the defect detection rate.

The ACE statistic can also be considered an adaptive CFAR matched sub-space detector (MSD). It is this interpretation which is particularly useful in radar and signal processing. We conclude this paper by applying the adaptive CFAR MSD to data recorded from the Mountaintop radar. These experimental results indicate that, in a channel with time varying gain, the adaptive CFAR MSD has better detection performance than those detectors which are not invariant to this type of scaling.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13241/00601076.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"540 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1996.601076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.601076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=601076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive coherence estimation for radar signal processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar signal processing","Statistics","Covariance matrix","Radar detection","Detectors","Contracts","Random variables","Probability","Adaptive signal processing","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive radar","adaptive signal processing","radar signal processing","adaptive estimation","probability","radar detection","time-varying channels","radar theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar signal processing","adaptive coherence estimation","probability density functions","ACE statistic","adaptive CFAR matched sub-space detector","Mountaintop radar","time varying gain","detection performance","scaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive coherence estimation for radar signal processing","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5697237","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive coherence estimation for radar signal processing","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00601076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041737S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"28","articleId":"601076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":601080,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This approach differs from previously proposed block-based superresolution methods in which the computed DOA's (and the corresponding power levels) of the sources are passed onto a processing block which computes the Wiener optimal spatial filter weights. The powerful block-based methods tend to be non-recursive which limits the rate at which the beampattern can be updated and thus the overall nulling capability in a non-stationary operating environment. In contrast, the LORAF is computed recursively and, like many of the superresolution methods, exploits the low-rank nature of the problem. Conventional full-rank adaptive methods such as LMS and RLS fail to exploit the low-rank nature of the problem and consequently suffer in their ability to determine the DOA's of the sources under the stressing cases of low SNR or closely spaced sources.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.601082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13241","startPage":"556","endPage":"560 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13241/00601082.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A LORAF-based coherent sidelobe canceller for narrowband adaptive beamforming applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"A LORAF-based coherent sidelobe canceller for narrowband adaptive beamforming applications","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5697241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A LORAF-based coherent sidelobe canceller for narrowband adaptive beamforming applications","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00601082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048702S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"1","articleId":"601082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":601086,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The performance using a space-path diversity maximal ratio combining receiver, for different data rates and a typical urban channel model (maximum delay of 5 /spl mu/s), is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of 2-dimensional RAKE receiver for high data rates in direct sequence mobile communications","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1996.601125","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13241/00601125.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"646 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.601125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=601125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Performance of 2-dimensional RAKE receiver for high data rates in direct sequence mobile communications","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5697257","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of 2-dimensional RAKE receiver for high data rates in direct sequence mobile communications","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00601125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033644S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"1","articleId":"601125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":601133,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

Most blind equalization methods however, assume time-invariant channels and may not be applicable to fading channels with severe Doppler spread. We address the problem of simultaneously estimating the Doppler shift and channel parameters in a blind setup. Both deterministic and stochastic maximum likelihood methods are developed and iterative solutions proposed. The stochastic maximum likelihood solution is based on the modified version of the Baum-Welch (1970) algorithm which originated in the study of hidden Markov models. The proposed methods are well suited for short data records, appearing in TDMA systems. Identifiability and performance analysis issues are discussed and Cramer-Rao bounds are derived. Also, some illustrative simulations are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/4760/13241/00601142.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"717 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of The Thirtieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1996.601142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1996.601142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=601142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood blind channel estimation in the presence of frequency shifts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Blind equalizers","Stochastic processes","Hidden Markov models","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Land mobile radio","Frequency","Doppler effect","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","fading","Doppler effect","Doppler shift","hidden Markov models","time division multiple access","cellular radio","equalisers","digital radio","access protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood blind channel estimation","frequency shifts","transmitter/receiver motion","mobile radio channels","Doppler effects","blind equalization methods","time-invariant channels","fading channels","Doppler spread","channel parameter estimation","stochastic maximum likelihood method","deterministic maximum likelihood method","iterative solutions","Baum-Welch algorithm","hidden Markov models","short data records","TDMA systems","performance analysis","Cramer-Rao bounds","simulations","digital transmission","identifiability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood blind channel estimation in the presence of frequency shifts","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5703839","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood blind channel estimation in the presence of frequency shifts","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00601142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046821S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"13241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760","citationCount":"6","articleId":"601142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":601143,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Our basic aim is to draw on this framework to provide a comparative evaluation of a number of contrasting approaches to relational matching. Broadly speaking there are two main aspects to this study. Firstly we focus on the issue of how relational inexactness may be quantified. We illustrate that several popular relational distance measures can be recovered as specific limiting cases of the Bayesian consistency measure. The second aspect of our comparison concerns the way in which structural inexactness is controlled. We investigate three different realizations of the matching process which draw on contrasting control models. The main conclusion of our study is that the active process of graph-editing outperforms the alternatives in terms of its ability to effectively control a large population of contaminating clutter.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/13258/00601251.pdf","doi":"10.1109/34.601251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.601251","startPage":"634","endPage":"648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural matching by discrete relaxation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601251/","displayDocTitle":"Structural matching by discrete relaxation","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5633192","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural matching by discrete relaxation","sourcePdf":"00601251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067109S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"222","articleId":"601251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":601254,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Program understanding activities are thus made more difficult, since pointers affect the memory locations that are referenced in a statement, and also the functions called by a statement, when function pointers are used. The programmer needs to build a mental model of the memory use and of the pointers to its locations, in order to comprehend the functionalities of the system. This paper presents an efficient flow insensitive context insensitive points-to analysis algorithm capable of dealing with the features of the C code. It is extremely promising with regard to scalability, because of the low complexity. The results are valuable by themselves, as their graphical display represents the points to links between locations. They are also integrated with other program understanding techniques like, e.g., call graph construction, slicing, plan recognition and architectural recovery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Mar 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5609813","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Points to analysis for program understanding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Points to analysis for program understanding","confLoc":"Dearborn, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00601271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031546S","chronDate":"28-30 Mar 1997","isNumber":"13167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740","citationCount":"5","articleId":"601271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":601312,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This means that all protection requirements (i.e. accesses to be allowed or denied) must be specified in terms of the policy enforced by the system. While this may be trivial for some requirements, specification of other requirements may become quite complex or even impossible. The reason for this is that a single policy simply cannot capture the different protection requirements that users may need to enforce on different data. In this paper, we take a first step towards a model that is able to support different access control policies. We propose a logical language for the specification of authorizations on which such a model can be based. The Authorization Specification Language (ASL) allows users to specify, together with the authorizations, the policy according to which access control decisions are to be made. Policies are expressed by means of rules which enforce the derivation of authorizations, conflict resolution, access control and integrity constraint checking. We illustrate the power of our language by showing how different constraints that are sometimes required, but very seldom supported by existing access control systems, can be represented in our language.","doi":"10.1109/SECPRI.1997.601312","startPage":"31","endPage":"42","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Cat.

Under the presumption that the hardware comprising the machine (the lowest layer) is valid, the integrity of a layer can be guaranteed if and only if: (1) the integrity of the lower layers is checked and (2) transitions to higher layers occur only after integrity checks on them are complete. The resulting integrity \"chain\" inductively guarantees system integrity. When these conditions are not met, as they typically are not in the bootstrapping (initialization) of a computer system, no integrity guarantees can be made, yet these guarantees are increasingly important to diverse applications such as Internet commerce, security systems and \"active networks\". In this paper, we describe the AEGIS architecture for initializing a computer system. It validates integrity at each layer transition in the bootstrap process. AEGIS also includes a recovery process for integrity check failures, and we show how this results in robust systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECPRI.1997.601317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13107","startPage":"65","endPage":"71","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Cat.

It is popularly called SYN flooding. It works by an attacker sending many TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection requests with spoofed source addresses to a victim's machine. Each request causes the targeted host to instantiate data structures out of a limited pool of resources. Once the target host's resources are exhausted, no more incoming TCP connections can be established, thus denying further legitimate access. The paper contributes a detailed analysis of the SYN flooding attack and a discussion of existing and proposed countermeasures. Furthermore, we introduce a new solution approach, explain its design, and evaluate its performance. Our approach offers protection against SYN flooding for all hosts connected to the same local area network, independent of their operating system or networking stack implementation. It is highly portable, configurable, extensible, and requires neither special hardware, nor modifications in routers or protected end systems.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Cat.

To accommodate a large number of connections, a switch can employ link-scheduling algorithms to prioritize the transmission of the queued packets. Due to the high-speed links and small packet sizes, a hardware solution is needed for the priority queue in order to make the link schedulers effective. But for good performance, the switch should also support a large number of priority levels (P) and be able to buffer a large number of packets (N). So a hardware priority queue design must be both fast and scalable (with respect to N and P) in order to be implemented effectively. In this paper we first compare four existing hardware priority queue architectures, and identify scalability limitations on implementing these existing architectures for large N and P. Based on our findings, we propose two new priority queue architectures, and evaluate them using simulation results from Verilog HDL and Epoch implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable hardware priority queue architectures for high-speed packet switches","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Real-Time Technology and Applications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RTTAS.1997.601359","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Real-Time Technology and Applications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4795/13253/00601359.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTTAS.1997.601359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=601359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Scalable hardware priority queue architectures for high-speed packet switches","conferenceDate":"9-11 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644503","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable hardware priority queue architectures for high-speed packet switches","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00601359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046806S","chronDate":"9-11 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795","citationCount":"20","articleId":"601359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":601361,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

QoS negotiation is shown to (i) outperform conventional \"binary\" admission control schemes (either guaranteeing the required QoS or rejecting the service request), and (ii) achieve higher application-perceived system utility. We incorporated the proposed QoS-negotiation model into an example real-time middleware service, called RTPOOL, which manages a distributed pool of shared computing resources (processors) to guarantee timeliness QoS for real-time applications. The efficacy and power of QoS negotiation are demonstrated for an automated flight control system implemented on a network of PCs running RT-POOL. This system is used to fly an F-16 fighter aircraft modeled using the Aerial Combat (ACM) F-16 Flight Simulator. Experimental results indicate that QoS negotiation, while maintaining real-time guarantees, enables graceful QoS degradation under conditions in which traditional schedulability analysis and admission control schemes fail.","doi":"10.1109/RTTAS.1997.601361","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Real-Time Technology and Applications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE Real-Time Technology and Applications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4795/13253/00601361.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTTAS.1997.601361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS negotiation in real-time systems and its application to automated flight control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=601361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601361/","displayDocTitle":"QoS negotiation in real-time systems and its application to automated flight control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644505","conferenceDate":"9-11 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS negotiation in real-time systems and its application to automated flight control","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00601361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034361S","chronDate":"9-11 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795","citationCount":"60","articleId":"601361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":601380,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The structure of the multiplier is so simple and regular that it is suitable for VLSI implementation. Partial products in the multiplier are generated as the corresponding value 0 to 9 and are implemented by simple CMOS current-mode circuits. To add partial products in the multiplier, we introduce a redundant multi-valued adder (RMA). The RMA can add two redundant numbers without carry propagation. The resulting numbers in the final level of additions are also redundant. We use a high speed quaternary carry-lookahead adder (QCLA) to convert a redundant number into a non-redundant number. The chip of a CMOS 4/spl times/4-digit quaternary multiplier is fabricated in cooperation with the VLSI Design and Education Center of Tokyo University, Japan. The chip and core sizes of the multiplier are 2.3/spl times/2.3 mm/sup 2/ and 1.5/spl times/1.6 mm/sup 2/, respectively with 1.5 /spl mu/m technology. The layout design of a 16/spl times/16-digit quaternary multiplier with 0.8 /spl mu/m technology is also discussed for the practical use.","doi":"10.1109/ISMVL.1997.601392","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 27th International Symposium on Multiple- Valued Logic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 27th International Symposium on Multiple- Valued Logic","pdfPath":"/iel3/4797/13255/00601392.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMVL.1997.601392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI design of a quaternary multiplier with direct generation of partial products","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=601392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601392/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI design of a quaternary multiplier with direct generation of partial products","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5615772","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI design of a quaternary multiplier with direct generation of partial products","confLoc":"Antigonish, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"00601392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035271S","chronDate":"28-30 May 1997","isNumber":"13255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4797","citationCount":"12","articleId":"601392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":601412,"authors":[{"name":"J. del R.

Many achievements have been published so far. In practice, premature convergence and evolving too slowly are the common problems we often meet when a simple GA (SGA) is used. Over the years, many modifications have been suggested to alleviate the difficulties. This paper introduces an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) using 80/20 rule. SGA and the improved GA are both used to solve scheduling problems. The global optimum can not be obtained by SGA at all because of the serious premature convergence problem. When we use the improved GA, the results become much better. The global minimum or approximate global minimum can be obtained in a short time. The premature convergence problem has also been solved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601625/","accessionNumber":"5615817","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Heuristics genetic algorithm using 80/20 rule","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heuristics genetic algorithm using 80/20 rule","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"00601625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04729S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec 1996","isNumber":"13254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796","citationCount":"3","articleId":"601625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":601629,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Lindu","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Lindu","id":"37087400660"},{"name":"Sheng Zhaohan","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Sheng Zhaohan","id":"37087399789"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3104-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"601629","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=601629","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Fault diagnosis","Machinery","Shafts","Orbits","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Shape","Convergence","Power generation economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine testing","rotors","fault diagnosis","discrete cosine transforms","neural nets","mechanical engineering","mechanical engineering computing","backpropagation","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transform","neural network","rotating machinery","shaft centerline orbits","rotating machinery fault diagnosis","input dimension","back-propagation","convergence","simulated fault data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIT.1996.601629","pdfPath":"/iel3/4796/13254/00601629.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT'96)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT'96)","startPage":"450","endPage":"454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.1996.601629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combination of discrete cosine transform with neural network in fault diagnosis for rotating machinery","abstract":"The orbits of shaft centerline are pieces of indispensable information for the rotating machinery fault diagnosis, in general, a special shape of orbits of shaft centerline corresponds to a special fault type.

The NIMC controller consists of a model inverse controller and a robust filter with single adjustable parameter. Two alternative control schemes, direct and indirect control, are discussed and improved. In the direct control, the neural network (controller) is used as a inverse process dynamics whose output is explicitly calculated as control action. On the contrary, the indirect control calculates the control action by directly inverting the network describing the process dynamics and thus constructs a rigorous inverse process model. To accommodate general uncertainty descriptions and ensure offset-free performance, a fuzzy neural network is proposed here.

Satellites provide unique advantages such as remote coverage with rapid deployment, distance insensitivity, bandwidth on demand, immunity to terrestrial disasters, and offering broadband links. Satellite ATM networks will play an important role in the rapidly evolving information infrastructure. However, there are several obstacles which need to be overcome so that satellite ATM networks can operate in full service. The objective of this survey is to present the state of the art in satellite ATM networks and to point out open research problems. We explain the satellite ATM network architecture and cover the requirements and technical barriers for seamless integration of ATM and satellite networks. We describe the feasibility of the existing ATM cell transport methods, and deal with conventional and new satellite link access methods, and some error control schemes for the satellite environment. We then describe the problems of the proposed traffic and congestion control schemes, followed by the error performance of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Service-Specific Connection-Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) for the satellite ATM network. We present basic requirements and a possible architecture for local area-metropolitan area network (LAN-MAN) interconnection using satellite ATM and then discuss the requirements for multimedia services in satellite ATM networks.","doi":"10.1109/35.601740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.601740","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/13111/00601740.pdf","startPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satellite ATM networks: a survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601740/","displayDocTitle":"Satellite ATM networks: a survey","volume":"35","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5646871","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite ATM networks: a survey","sourcePdf":"00601740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082402S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"97","articleId":"601740","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":601743,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The space segment proposal is geared toward a TDMA-based satellite network comprising many nongeostationary satellites, while the ground segment proposal does not put any restriction an the satellite network. The ground segment proposal is based on the new ATM adaptation layer 2 (AAL2) which we consider to have a major role to play in offering an efficient way to provide multimedia services over ATM networks. Indeed, it allows easy encapsulation of the complete set of media component sessions which forms a multimedia transaction into a single ATM virtual channel connection. An additional advantage of AAL2 is that it can run over any arbitrary slotted access system independent of the ATM format (i.e., without transporting the ATM cell headers). This is important for efficient interfacing of the ground and space segments. The space segment proposal aims at providing a robust, easily managed and controlled architecture to guarantee QoS by using a combination of connectionless and connection-oriented techniques. This is achieved by: defining a fixed logical network architecture (i.e., independent of the motion of the satellites); limiting the functionality of the switches in the sky; and using adequate addressing and routing procedures.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/13111/00601743.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"65","doi":"10.1109/35.601743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.601743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS guarantees for multimedia services on a TDMA-based satellite network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"QoS guarantees for multimedia services on a TDMA-based satellite network","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5646874","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS guarantees for multimedia services on a TDMA-based satellite network","sourcePdf":"00601743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025779S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"78","articleId":"601743","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":601746,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The 3-30 MHz high-frequency (HF) band is used for ionospheric communications, and the 300 MHz-3 GHz ultra-high-frequency (UHF) and 3-30 GHz super-high-frequency (SHF) bands are used for tropospheric scatter. Although the fading effects in a mobile radio system are somewhat different than those in ionospheric and tropospheric channels, the early models are still quite useful to help characterize fading effects in mobile digital communication systems. This tutorial addresses Rayleigh fading primarily in the UHF band. That affects mobile systems such as cellular and personal communication systems (PCS). Part I of the tutorial itemizes the fundamental fading manifestations and types of degradation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/601747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","volume":"35","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5646878","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rayleigh fading channels in mobile digital communication systems .I.

However, the formulation is applied to a more simple case in which the noise is assumed to be stationary.

The WAP architecture needs no global clock for controlling the entire processors and each processing element can even be clocked differently. Thus, the clock skew becomes no longer problem and it is possible to construct massively parallel networks which are required for handwritten character recognition. We also present experimental results for the recognition of unconstrained handwritten numerals with the WAP architecture. The results were very impressive in view of real world application.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4755/13256/00602003.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"718 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1995.602003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1995.602003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel hardware implementation of handwritten character recognition system on wavefront array processor architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Clocks","Computer architecture","Neural networks","Handwriting recognition","Neural network hardware","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Communication system control","Telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","handwriting recognition","parallel architectures","image classification","neural nets","character recognition equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel hardware","handwritten character recognition","wavefront array processor","neural network classifier","clock skew","unconstrained handwritten numerals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Parallel hardware implementation of handwritten character recognition system on wavefront array processor architecture","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5630531","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel hardware implementation of handwritten character recognition system on wavefront array processor architecture","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00602003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050402S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","isNumber":"13256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755","citationCount":"1","articleId":"602003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":602017,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The directional probability density function was used as a global shape factor, and its discriminatory power was enhanced by reducing its cardinality. The choice of the best pretreatment was made by means of a k nearest neighbour classifier. This study has shown that the cardinality of the PDF can be reduced by a factor of ten while doubling its discriminatory power. The backpropagation model was retained to build the neural network classifier. An experimental protocol was used to find the best configuration of the BPN classifier whose performance was compared on the same database and with the same decision rule (without rejection criteria), to those of the kNN and threshold classifiers. This comparison shows that the BPN classifier is clearly better than the T classifier, and compares favourably with the kNN classifier.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1995.602024","startPage":"807","endPage":"810 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1995.602024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13256","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4755/13256/00602024.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of the k nearest neighbour, threshold and neural network classifiers for handwritten signature verification using an enhanced directional PDF","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602024/","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of the k nearest neighbour, threshold and neural network classifiers for handwritten signature verification using an enhanced directional PDF","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5630550","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of the k nearest neighbour, threshold and neural network classifiers for handwritten signature verification using an enhanced directional PDF","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00602024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046671S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1995","isNumber":"13256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755","citationCount":"2","articleId":"602024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":602059,"authors":[{"name":"Jaekyu Ha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, FT-10, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Jaekyu Ha","id":"37614239000"},{"name":"R.M.

In order to verify the performance of the proposed scheme, experiments with unconstrained handwritten numeral database of Concordia University of Canada, that of Electro-Technical Laboratory of Japan, and that of Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute of Korea were performed.

Using generalized properties of published CMOS timing models, we formulate a novel nonlinear buffer insertion problem. Next, we derive an algorithm that bounds the capacitance for each buffer stage without sacrificing the generality of the timing models. With this capacitance bound we formulate a second linear buffer insertion problem, which we solve optimally in O(n) time. The basic formulation and algorithm are extended to include a skew upper bound constraint. Using these algorithms we propose further algorithmic extensions that allow area and phase delay tradeoffs. Our results are verified using SPICE3e2 simulations with MCNC MOSIS 2.0 /spl mu/ models and parameters. Experiments with these test cases show that the buffer insertion algorithms proposed herein can be used effectively for designs with high clock speeds and small skews.","doi":"10.1109/43.602470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/13264/00602470.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.602470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal buffer insertion in clock trees with skew and slew rate constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602470/","displayDocTitle":"Minimal buffer insertion in clock trees with skew and slew rate constraints","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5659934","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal buffer insertion in clock trees with skew and slew rate constraints","sourcePdf":"00602470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054649S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"66","articleId":"602470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":602474,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Zhu","affiliation":["Actel Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kai Zhu","id":"37349276500"},{"name":"D.F.

Furthermore, the clock pins are connected to the clock trees via programmable switches. As a result, the load capacitances of a clock tree may be changed, depending on the utilization and distribution of logic modules in an FPGA. It is possible to minimize clock skew by carefully distributing the load capacitances or, equivalently, the logic modules used for the circuit design implementation. In this paper we present an algorithm for selecting logic modules used for circuit placement such that the clock skew is minimized. The algorithm can be applied to a variety of clock tree architectures, including those used in the major commercial FPGA's. The algorithm can also be extended to handle buffered clock trees and multiple clock trees Experimental results show that the algorithm can reduce clock skews significantly as compared with the traditional placement algorithms which do not consider clock skew minimization.","doi":"10.1109/43.602474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.602474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/13264/00602474.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock skew minimization during FPGA placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Clock skew minimization during FPGA placement","volume":"16","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5659938","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock skew minimization during FPGA placement","sourcePdf":"00602474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020921S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","articleId":"602474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":602476,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

In this paper, we investigate three of these parallel simulated annealing strategies when applied to standard cell placement, specifically the TimberWolfSC placement tool. We have examined a parallel moves strategy, as well as two new approaches to parallel cell placement-multiple Markov chains and speculative computation. These algorithms have been implemented in ProperPLACE, our parallel cell placement application, as part of the ProperCAD II project. We have constructed ProperPLACE so that it is portable across a wide range of parallel architectures. Our parallel moves algorithm uses novel approaches to dynamic message sizing, message prioritization, and error control.

The pulse duration was so short that heating of the biological matter could be neglected. The electrical energy required for lysing of bacteria, or stunning of aquatic species, decreases when the pulse duration is reduced. For lysing of Eschericia coli, this tendency has been proven to hold for pulsewidths as short as 60 ns. For macroorganisms, however, it was found that for pulsewidths of less than 5 /spl mu/s, the tendency is reversed: the energy required to affect the macroorganisms increases again. This minimum in energy, or maximum in efficiency, respectively, can be understood by taking the time required for electrical charging of the cell membrane into account. Applications of the pulsed electric field technique (PEFT) are in biofouling prevention, debacterialization of liquids, and in the field of medicine. A series of field tests on biofouling prevention in a cooling system with untreated water as coolant has demonstrated the economic feasibility of the electro-technology.","doi":"10.1109/27.602501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/13232/00602501.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.602501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13232","startPage":"284","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of pulsed electric fields on biological cells: experiments and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effect of pulsed electric fields on biological cells: experiments and applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5654129","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of pulsed electric fields on biological cells: experiments and applications","sourcePdf":"00602501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041726S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"229","articleId":"602501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":602513,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

In this study, the authors applied unsupervised cluster analysis to separate SSM/I brightness temperature (T/sub B/) observations into groups. Six desired snow conditions were identified from the clusters; both sparse- and medium-vegetated region scenes were assessed. Typical SSM/I T/sub B/ signatures for each snow condition were determined by calculating the mean T/sub B/ value of observations for each channel in the corresponding cluster. A single-hidden-layer artificial neural network (ANN) classifier was designed to learn the SSM/I T/sub B/ signatures. An error backpropagation training algorithm was applied to train the ANN. After training, a winner-takes-all method was used to determine the snow condition. Results showed that the ANN classifier was able to outline not only the snow extent but also the geographical distribution of snow conditions. This study confirms the potential of using cluster means in ANN supervised learning, and suggests a nonlinear retrieval method for inferring land-surface snow conditions from SSM/I data over varied terrain.","doi":"10.1109/36.602522","startPage":"801","endPage":"809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.602522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/13229/00602522.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring land-surface snow conditions from SSM/I data using an artificial neural network classifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602522/","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring land-surface snow conditions from SSM/I data using an artificial neural network classifier","volume":"35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5654150","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring land-surface snow conditions from SSM/I data using an artificial neural network classifier","sourcePdf":"00602522.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054645S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"11","articleId":"602522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":602524,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

Thanks to a simplifying hypothesis, the compound classification rule is transformed into a form easier to compute. In the obtained rule, an important role is played by the probabilities of transitions, which take into account the temporal dependence between two images. In order to avoid requiring that training sets be representative of all possible types of transitions, the authors propose an iterative algorithm which allows the probabilities of transitions to be estimated directly from the images under investigation.

As a consequence, a discrete model, well suited to numerical inversion, is developed. The particular bilinear nature of the equations, and a suitable choice of contrast and field unknowns allows the functional adopted in the estimation to be minimized in an accurate and numerically efficient manner.

The main objective of the study is to assess the possibility of extracting relevant information about surface roughness using polarimetry. The methodology is expected to be of interest either for deriving maps of surface roughness or for setting up soil moisture retrieving procedure based on a preliminary estimation of soil roughness. After a description of ground data, experimental, and theoretical backscattering coefficients are investigated. In a further step, the dependence of copolarized correlation coefficient on the roughness and moisture states is addressed. In order to investigate the polarization effect, the correlation coefficient is described for any set of orthogonal polarizations. The results indicate an enhanced sensitivity of the correlation coefficient on roughness using circular polarizations. The analysis is subsequently extended to additional data sets acquired in the frame of SIR C/XSAR experiment (Les Landes forest, France) and AIRSAR experiment (Chickasha, USA). These further investigations confirm the trend observed on Matera data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","volume":"35","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5654165","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The effect of surface roughness on multifrequency polarimetric SAR data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of surface roughness on multifrequency polarimetric SAR data","sourcePdf":"00602537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038047S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"146","articleId":"602537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":602543,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

The methods presented focus on combining multiple images from the AVIRIS sensor into a smaller subset of images white maintaining the visual information necessary for human analysis. Two of the techniques are published algorithms that were originally designed to combine images from multiple sensors, but are shown to work well on multiple images from the same sensor. The third method presented was developed specifically to fuse hyperspectral images for visual analysis. This new method uses the spatial frequency response (contrast sensitivity) of the human visual system to determine which features in the input images need to be preserved in the composite image(s) thus ensuring the composite image maintains the visually relevant features from each input image. The image fusion algorithms are analyzed using test images with known image characteristics and image data from the AVIRIS hyperspectral sensor. After analyzing the signal-to-noise ratios and visual aesthetics of the fused images, contrast sensitivity based fusion is shown to provide excellent fusion results and, in every case, outperformed the other two methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.602543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/13229/00602543.pdf","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1017","doi":"10.1109/36.602543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual-based image fusion for hyperspectral data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual-based image fusion for hyperspectral data","volume":"35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5654171","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual-based image fusion for hyperspectral data","sourcePdf":"00602543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033487S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"87","articleId":"602543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":602544,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Dempster-Shafer formulation allows for consideration of unions of classes, and to represent both imprecision and uncertainty, through the definition of belief and plausibility functions. These two functions, derived from mass function, are generally chosen in a supervised way. In this paper, the authors describe an unsupervised method, based on the comparison of monosource classification results, to select the classes necessary for Dempster-Shafer evidence combination and to define their mass functions. Data fusion is then performed, discarding invalid clusters (e.g. corresponding to conflicting information) thank to an iterative process. Unsupervised multisource classification algorithm is applied to MAC-Europe'91 multisensor airborne campaign data collected over the Orgeval French site. Classification results using different combinations of sensors (TMS and AirSAR) or wavelengths (L- and C-bands) are compared. Performance of data fusion is evaluated in terms of identification of land cover types. The best results are obtained when all three data sets are used. Furthermore, some other combinations of data are tried, and their ability to discriminate between the different land cover types is quantified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5654172","volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to unsupervised classification in multisource remote sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to unsupervised classification in multisource remote sensing","sourcePdf":"00602544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059435S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"234","articleId":"602544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":602545,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

Depending on the structural and dielectric characteristics of forest canopies, the relative contribution of each mechanism in the total backscatter signal of an imaging radar can vary. In this paper, two commonly used first-order discrete scattering models, distorted Born approximation (DBA) and radiative transfer (RT) are used to simulate the backscattered power received by polarimetric radars at P-, L-, and C-bands over coniferous and deciduous forests. The difference between the two models resides on the coherent effect in the surface-volume interaction terms. To demonstrate this point, the models are first compared based on their underlying theoretical assumptions and then according to simulation results over coniferous and deciduous forests. It is shown that by using the same scattering functions for various components of trees (i.e. leaf, branch, stem), the radiative transfer and distorted Born models are equivalent, except in low frequencies, where surface-volume interaction terms may become important, and the coherent contribution may be significant. In this case, the difference between the two models can reach up to 3 dB in both co-polarized and cross-polarized channels, which can influence the performance of retrieval algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5654173","displayDocTitle":"Coherent effects in microwave backscattering models for forest canopies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent effects in microwave backscattering models for forest canopies","sourcePdf":"00602545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046725S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"61","articleId":"602545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":602554,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The commutation capacitors of TCB devices that interrupt current in a single switching operation absorb virtually all the electromagnetic energy stored in circuits, where they operate during the single switching process. These device types interrupt current extremely fast, but because of the scale of the energy transfer to the commutation capacitor, they are especially prone to producing short-duration switching overvoltages of excessive magnitude. A novel TCB device involving two switching operations or stages is presented and analyzed. With this device type, the circuit-stored energy is transferred to the commutation capacitor in two stages, which, in so doing, produces significantly lower switching overvoltages than the conventional \"single-stage\" TCB device. Results of a range of tests on a low-voltage two-stage TCB device and a high-power-prototype version are given together with the basis for determining their optimum design criteria. Comparative simulation studies are also provided.

First, an analysis of voltage- and current-switching waveforms of gate-insulated devices is performed.

These techniques were adopted in order to allow correct generation of the gate signals regardless of the operating conditions. Finally, practical results of the proposed driving circuit obtained using a single IGBT switch chopper are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching-behavior improvement of insulated gate-controlled devices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.602559","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/13230/00602559.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.602559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","displayDocTitle":"Switching-behavior improvement of insulated gate-controlled devices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5641071","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching-behavior improvement of insulated gate-controlled devices","sourcePdf":"00602559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044695S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"66","articleId":"602559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":602562,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Boost and flyback power converters have a right-half-plane zero (RHPZ) in their transfer function from the duty cycle to the output voltage, which makes it difficult to achieve the aforementioned goals. Here, the authors propose to design a controller using H/sup /spl infin// control theory, via the solution of two algebraic Riccati equations. The almost optimal H/sup /spl infin// controller is of the same order as the converter and has a relatively low DC gain. The closed-loop characteristics of a typical low-power boost power converter with four different control schemes were compared by computer simulation. The H/sup /spl infin// control was found to be superior in a wide frequency range, while being outperformed by the others at extremely low frequencies. Good agreement was found between simulation results and experimental measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","publicationDate":"July 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5641075","volume":"12","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"H/sup /spl infin// control applied to boost power converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H/sup /spl infin// control applied to boost power converters","sourcePdf":"00602563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073253S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"161","articleId":"602563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":602567,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Yu Tzou","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Motion Control Laboratory, Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Yu Tzou","id":"37087075631"},{"name":"Rong-Shyang Ou","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Motion Control Laboratory, Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rong-Shyang Ou","id":"37088185341"},{"name":"Shih-Liang Jung","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Motion Control Laboratory, Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Liang Jung","id":"37087310514"},{"name":"Meng-Yueh Chang","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Motion Control Laboratory, Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Meng-Yueh Chang","id":"37087256935"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"602567","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":208,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2207},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system harmonics","Pulse width modulation inverters","Voltage control","Steady-state","Signal synthesis","Pulse inverters","State feedback","Transient response","Error correction","Digital signal processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","DC-AC power convertors","power system harmonics","harmonic distortion","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","voltage control","control system analysis","pole assignment","state feedback","dynamic response","load (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable AC power source","harmonic distortion","DSP-based repetitive control technique","two-layer control structure","transient response","steady-state response","closed-loop regulation","PWM inverter","sinusoidal AC voltage regulation","tracking controller","repetitive controller","pole assignment","state feedback","contol design","total harmonic distortion","bridge-rectifier RC load","current crest factor","dynamic response","control simulation","2 kVA","60 Hz"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new control scheme based on a two-layer control structure to improve both the transient and steady-state responses of a closed-loop regulated pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverter for high-quality sinusoidal AC voltage regulation.

Pole assignment with state feedback has been employed in designing the tracking controller for transient response improvement, and a repetitive control scheme was developed in synthesizing the repetitive controller for steady-state response improvement. A design procedure is given for synthesizing the repetitive controller for PWM inverters to minimize periodic errors induced by rectifier-type nonlinear loads. The proposed control scheme has been realized using a single-chip digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320C14 from Texas Instruments. A 2-kVA PWM inverter has been constructed to verify the proposed control scheme. Total harmonic distortion (THD) below 1.4% for a 60-Hz output voltage under a bridge-rectifier RC load with a current crest factor of 3 has been obtained. Simulation and experimental results show that the DSP-based fully digital-controlled PWM inverter can achieve both good dynamic response and low harmonics distortion.","doi":"10.1109/63.602567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/13230/00602567.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.602567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13230","startPage":"715","endPage":"725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance programmable AC power source with low harmonic distortion using DSP-based repetitive control technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-performance programmable AC power source with low harmonic distortion using DSP-based repetitive control technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602567/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5641079","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance programmable AC power source with low harmonic distortion using DSP-based repetitive control technique","sourcePdf":"00602567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033536S","chronDate":"July  1997","isNumber":"13230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"208","articleId":"602567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":602571,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The algorithm is derived for the case of continuous phase modulation (CPM) signals transmitted over Rayleigh flat-fading channels, and a corresponding receiver structure is specified. It is shown that the MAP algorithm requires computing, for each trellis branch, the sum of the products of the weights of all paths through the trellis which pass through that branch, and that this generic computational problem can be solved efficiently by an approach that uses a forward and backward recursion through the trellis. Simulation results are presented which show both the hard and soft decision performance of the MAP receiver to be robust, even in the presence of fade rates of up to 30% of the symbol rate. The application of the receiver concept to phase-shift keying (PSK) signals is also discussed, and then evaluated via simulation. The concept of joint demodulation and decoding using iterative processing techniques is introduced. It is shown that the MAP receiver is well suited for iterative processing applications due to its use of a priori symbol probabilities and its production of optimal soft decisions. Simulation results for the reception of quaternary PSK (QPSK) show that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the iterative MAP receiver can approach that of a receiver operating with perfect knowledge of the fading process.","doi":"10.1109/26.602584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.602584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/13231/00602584.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol-by-symbol MAP demodulation of CPM and PSK signals on Rayleigh flat-fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-by-symbol MAP demodulation of CPM and PSK signals on Rayleigh flat-fading channels","volume":"45","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5654083","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-by-symbol MAP demodulation of CPM and PSK signals on Rayleigh flat-fading channels","sourcePdf":"00602584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049911S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"86","articleId":"602584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":602587,"authors":[{"name":"Cherng-Shung Hsu","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology, Lungtan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cherng-Shung Hsu","id":"37382928400"},{"name":"V.O.K.

Based on this formulation, we develop infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) for estimating the sensitivity of the average probability of bit error to factors ranging from near-far effects to imperfections in power control. The above estimates are shown to be unbiased, and this technique is then further incorporated into a stochastic gradient algorithm for achieving adaptive multiuser interference rejection for such systems, which is also subject to frequency nonselective slow fading. We use an IPA-based stochastic training algorithm for developing an adaptive linear detector with the average probability of error being the minimization criterion. We also develop a practical implementation of such an adaptive detector where we use a joint estimation-detection algorithm for minimizing the average probability of bit error. A sequential implementation that does not require a stochastic training sequence or a preamble is also developed.","doi":"10.1109/26.602590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/13231/00602590.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.602590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient estimation for sensitivity analysis and adaptive multiuser interference rejection in code-division multiple-access systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602590/","displayDocTitle":"Gradient estimation for sensitivity analysis and adaptive multiuser interference rejection in code-division multiple-access systems","volume":"45","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5654090","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient estimation for sensitivity analysis and adaptive multiuser interference rejection in code-division multiple-access systems","sourcePdf":"00602590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049763S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","articleId":"602590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":602592,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A three-dimensional subband decomposition followed by vector quantization of the subband coefficients forms the source coding strategy. For transmission over the channel, the individual subbands are offered different amounts of protection depending on their importance in reconstruction at the receiver. For each subband, the source coding rate as well as the level of protection (quantified by the channel coding rate) are jointly chosen to minimize the total mean-squared distortion suffered by the video coder. The choice of source and channel coding rates depends on the state of the physical channel. We use a finite state model for the fading channel, where every state corresponds to an AWGN channel. This results in a joint source-channel coding scheme that adapts in an optimal way to the current state of a fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of First Signal Processing Society Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4800/13276/00602669.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of First Signal Processing Society Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.1997.602669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.1997.602669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive source-channel subband video coding for wireless channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Fading","Channel coding","Source coding","Error correction codes","Protection","Decoding","Automation","Educational institutions","Vector quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","vector quantisation","adaptive codes","channel coding","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband video coding","wireless channels","adaptive","fading wireless channels","vector quantization","source coding","reconstruction","finite state model","fading channel","AWGN channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive source-channel subband video coding for wireless channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730673","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-25 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive source-channel subband video coding for wireless channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00602669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051152S","chronDate":"23-25 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4800","citationCount":"8","articleId":"602669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":602671,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Yao Wang","id":"37281434600"},{"name":"M.T.

This paper presents a new method for MDC using the framework of transform coding. Instead of using the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) that decorrelates all the coefficients, we choose the transform bases so that the coefficients are correlated pair-wise. This is accomplished by rotating every two basis vectors in the KLT. Each pair of correlated coefficients are then split between two descriptions. Only 45/spl deg/ rotation is considered which leads to two balanced streams. In the actual implementation, the DCT is employed in place of the KLT and the rotation of transform bases is accomplished by rotating the DCT coefficients. Experimental results show that this method can lead to satisfactory image reconstruction from any one description with a relatively small (20% for \"lena\") overhead over a standard JPEG coder.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of First Signal Processing Society Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of First Signal Processing Society Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4800/13276/00602671.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple description image coding for noisy channels by pairing transform coefficients","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.1997.602671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.1997.602671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multiple description image coding for noisy channels by pairing transform coefficients","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730675","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple description image coding for noisy channels by pairing transform coefficients","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00602671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048047S","chronDate":"23-25 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4800","citationCount":"111","articleId":"602671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":602701,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

However, with added benefits come many problems and challenges. The increase in transducer channels needed in a l 1/2 -D and 2-D array can be reduced using a sparse periodic or sparse random array. The complexity of the fabrication is overcome using a multi-layer flexible connector designed and fabricated using microelectronic techniques. The low SNR of 1 1/2 -D and 2-D arrays can be increased with the application of multi-layer ceramic elements to optimize the SNR given a specific transmit and receive configuration. We are also looking at PZT/polymer composites for SNR improvement as well as better acoustic matching to tissue. In addition, opto-electronic transmitters allow for the reductions in size and increase in flexibility of the transducer cable because of the use of fiber optics.","doi":"10.1109/ISAF.1996.602701","startPage":"5","endPage":"11 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"ISAF '96.

The measured results and the measurement method are useful for the design and adjustment of predistortion type linearizer for GaAs FET high power amplifiers.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1997.602945","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4660/13246/00602945.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1997.602945","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","startPage":"901","endPage":"904 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer characteristic of IM/sub 3/ relative phase for a GaAs FET amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=602945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"Transfer characteristic of IM/sub 3/ relative phase for a GaAs FET amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/602945/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5672316","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer characteristic of IM/sub 3/ relative phase for a GaAs FET amplifier","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00602945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030638S","chronDate":"8-13 June 1997","isNumber":"13246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660","citationCount":"5","articleId":"602945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":602967,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In order to validate our formulation, a full wave analysis of a thin film isolator is performed in 3D. Numerical results are then compared with measurements and a good agreement has been achieved.

The outstanding feature of the present implementation is the ability to perform simultaneously low-level signal acquisition, derandomizing data storage, sparsification and data transmission on a single monolithic chip. The signals from the detector strips are amplified, shaped by a CR-RC/sup 2/ filter with digitally selectable peaking time of 100 ns, 200 ns, 300 ns, or 400 ns, and then presented to a time-over-threshold processor to implement a compression type analog-to-digital conversion. The digital information is stored, sparsified and read out through a serial link upon receipt of a command. The digital section operates from a 60 MHz incoming clock. Noise measurements at 200 ns peaking time and 3.5 mW total power dissipation per channel yield an equivalent noise charge of 600 el. rms at 12 pF added source capacitance. The chip measures 5.7 mm/spl times/8.3 mm and contains 330 k transistors. The first full-scale prototype was fabricated in a radiation soft 0.8 /spl mu/m, 3-metal CMOS process. The same circuit is now being fabricated in an analogous radiation hard technology.","doi":"10.1109/23.603658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/23/13267/00603658.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.603658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13267","startPage":"289","endPage":"297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A time-over-threshold machine: the readout integrated circuit for the BABAR Silicon Vertex Tracker","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=603658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A time-over-threshold machine: the readout integrated circuit for the BABAR Silicon Vertex Tracker","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/603658/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5625634","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A time-over-threshold machine: the readout integrated circuit for the BABAR Silicon Vertex Tracker","sourcePdf":"00603658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066092S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"87","articleId":"603658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":603662,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

The topology developed is modular so that many functional blocks are identical for a number of subsystem types. Programmability is maximized through the use of flexible modular functions and implementation using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

The circuit is continuously sensitive, has no digital signals on chip, and requires no external components or critical adjustments.

A discrete convolution of measured electron response and the electron energy distribution for a particular scintillator yields the photon response. By establishing the ability to accurately calculate photon response, the experimental implications of scintillator light yield nonproportionality and geometry effects can be studied without the requirement for experimental measurements. This technique also provides a more detailed characterization of photon response than experimental techniques that rely on the use of multiple gamma-ray and X-ray sources. To demonstrate this technique, NaI(Tl), CaF/sub 2/(Eu), and LSO(Ce) photon responses have been calculated.

The method allows to forecast financial time series. Its originality lies in the fact that it is based on statistics and macroeconomics principles and it integrates fundamental economic knowledge in a multivariate nonlinear time series ANN model. The core of the work is a feasibility analysis. This is seldom attempted in ANN work and consists in a series of different univariate and multivariate, linear and nonlinear statistical tests. Here we use aggregated input indicators as a new pre-processing step.

The performance is evaluated by varying the network topology among several experiments to select the optimum structure for our task. A time delay arrangement is incorporated in the training phase to enable the network to discover useful acoustic-phonetic features without being blurred by shifts in the input. The input speech is processed to obtain a set of linear predictive (LP) derived cepstral coefficients. The input vector to the FNN consists of membership values to linguistic properties of the speech while the output vector is defined in terms of fuzzy class membership values. Three techniques were used to enhance the backpropagation training algorithm used to train the network in order to reduce training time and speed up convergence. The effectiveness of the suggested model is demonstrated on a speech recognition task consisting of Arabic phonemes extracted from a consonant-vowel-consonant (C-V-C) personnel database.","doi":"10.1109/ISNFS.1996.603839","startPage":"203","endPage":"211","displayPublicationTitle":"1st International Symposium on Neuro-Fuzzy Systems, AT '96.

The experimental results indicate that CdZnTe detectors have high resistivity, high signal-to-noise ratio, and high detector contrast resolution.

Using an additional sensor giving one pulse per revolution, this method transforms the input (asynchronous) signal into a synchronous signal having a fixed number of samples per revolution.

One important tool for object identification is vision. As a complement to vision laser scanner technique can be used. Differently shaped objects scatter the laser light differently. The scattered light is detected and converted to an analog voltage signal. To characterize the signals and to be able to classify the objects out of the signal we use Fourier transformation. The Fourier transformation gives a few parameters that can be used for classification. If we want to use the whole spectra for classification the statistical principal component analysis gives a good result. This method is a rather simple and inexpensive way to complement conventional object recognition systems, e.g. in robotics applications.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1997.604017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference Sensing, Processing, Networking.

Using a first-order model of the energy and delay of a CMOS circuit, we show that lowering the supply and threshold voltage is generally advantageous, especially when the transistors are velocity saturated and the nodes have a high activity factor, In fact, for modern submicron technologies, this simple analysis suggests optimal energy efficiency at supply voltages under 0.5 V. Other process and circuit parameters have almost no effect on this optimal operating point. If there is some uncertainty in the value of the threshold or supply voltage, however, the power advantage of this very low voltage operation diminishes. Therefore, unless active feedback is used to control the uncertainty, in the future the supply and threshold voltage will not decrease drastically, but rather will continue to scale down to maintain constant electric fields.","doi":"10.1109/4.604077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.604077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/13259/00604077.pdf","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supply and threshold voltage scaling for low power CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Supply and threshold voltage scaling for low power CMOS","volume":"32","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5667962","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604077/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supply and threshold voltage scaling for low power CMOS","sourcePdf":"00604077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09448S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"386","articleId":"604077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":604078,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The analytical results enable the estimation of the rise time of the output voltage and that of the power consumption during boosting. By using this analysis, the optimum number of stages to minimize the rise time has been estimated as 1.4 N/sub min/, where N/sub min/ is the minimum value of the number of stages necessary for a given parameter set of supply voltage, threshold voltage of transfer diodes, and boosted voltage. Moreover, the self-load capacitance of the charge pump, which should be charged up at the same time as the output load capacitance of the charge pump, has been estimated as about one-third of the total charge pump capacitance. As a result, the equivalent circuit of the charge pump has been modified. The analytical results are in good agreement with simulation by the iteration method, typically within 10% for the rise time and within 2% for the power consumption. In the case of a charge pump with MOS transfer transistors, the analytical results of the rise time agree with the SPICE simulation within 10%.","doi":"10.1109/4.604079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.604079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/13259/00604079.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic analysis of the Dickson charge pump circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic analysis of the Dickson charge pump circuit","volume":"32","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5667964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604079/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic analysis of the Dickson charge pump circuit","sourcePdf":"00604079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027885S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"243","articleId":"604079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":604083,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.M.

The ANFF is inherently a feedforward multilayered connectionist network which can learn by itself according to numerical training data or expert knowledge represented by fuzzy if-then rules. The adaptation here includes the construction of fuzzy if-then rules (structure learning), and the tuning of the free parameters of membership functions (parameter learning). In the structure learning phase, fuzzy rules are found based on the matching of input-output clusters. In the parameter learning phase, a backpropagation-like adaptation algorithm is developed to minimize the output error. There are no hidden nodes (i.e., no membership functions and fuzzy rules) initially, and both the structure learning and parameter learning are performed concurrently as the adaptation proceeds. However, if some linguistic information about the design of the filter is available, such knowledge can be put into the ANFF to form an initial structure with hidden nodes. Two major advantages of the ANFF can thus be seen: 1) a priori knowledge can be incorporated into the ANFF which makes the fusion of numerical data and linguistic information in the filter possible; and 2) no predetermination, like the number of hidden nodes, must be given, since the ANFF can find its optimal structure and parameters automatically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","volume":"27","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5653400","pubMedId":"18255903","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive neural fuzzy filter and its applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive neural fuzzy filter and its applications","sourcePdf":"00604107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058286S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"48","articleId":"604107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":604113,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

In this paper, the robust learning algorithm is derived. During the learning process, the robust objective function comes into effect and the approximated function will gradually be unaffected by the erroneous training data. As a result, the robust function approximation can rapidly converge to the desired tolerable error scope. In other words, the learning iterations will decrease greatly.

The method's efficacy in machine performance calculations is delineated and verified by comparison to experimental results. The critical role that winding inductance parameters have in modeling and simulation of the nonsinusoidal steady state time-domain (forced response) performance of electric machinery is demonstrated using state models in both the winding flux linkage and current-based frames of reference. The computed machine performance characteristics include profiles of winding inductances, induced terminal voltage waveforms, and instantaneous torque profiles that contain all the ripples due to the significant space harmonics in a machine. The method and associated formulations and techniques are shown to be very effective in both 2D-FE and 3D-FE electric machinery field solutions involving substantial degrees of saturation and complexity of construction. The machines analyzed include a 15-HP permanent magnet brushless DC motor, a 1.2-HP three-phase induction motor, and a 14.3 kVA three-phase modified Lundell alternator possessing very complex magnetic circuit geometries. The well-posedness of the method held true for all these cases, as well as many other case-studies briefly reviewed here.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604193/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5630254","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Electric machinery parameters and torques by current and energy perturbations from field computations.

The model utilizes an iterative approach to include the effects of magnetic nonlinearities, and space harmonics due to the machine magnetic circuits' topology and discrete winding layouts. Model formulation and development which include an improvement in the layout of the cage circuit representation, are given in this paper. This improvement leads to an enhancement of the \"well-posedness\" that is, reduction of ill-conditioning in the overall numerical convergence of the model. Meanwhile, in a companion paper results of induction motor performance simulation are compared with no-load and load tests for sinusoidal and inverter operating conditions. Particular attention is given to comparison between sinusoidal and inverter operating losses obtained from this generalized model.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4763/13194/00604288.pdf","startPage":"WA2/2.1","endPage":"WA2/2.3","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference Record","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.1997.604288","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.1997.604288","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference Record","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Coupling circuits","Inverters","Induction motor drives","Iterative methods","Magnetic circuits","Circuit topology","Machine windings","Convergence of numerical methods","Induction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","finite element analysis","state-space methods","harmonic analysis","magnetic circuits","iterative methods","machine windings","invertors","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-stepping coupled FEM-state space model","finite element-state space model","induction motor drives","model formulation","machine parameter computation","iterative approach","magnetic nonlinearities","space harmonics","machine magnetic circuits' topology","discrete winding layouts","cage circuit representation","ill-conditioning reduction","load tests","no-load tests","inverter operating conditions","sinusoidal operating conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604288/","displayDocTitle":"A time-stepping coupled finite element-state space model for induction motor drives.

These semiconductors have many properties that make them near ideal for electronic devices intended for high temperature, high frequency, high power, and radiation hard applications. Prototype SiC and GaN-based electronic devices with very good DC and RF performance have been demonstrated and devices such as diodes are commercially available, while RF and high frequency transistors are rapidly approaching the commercialization stage. In this work the performance of microwave power amplifiers fabricated using SiC and GaN-based MESFET's are discussed and investigated. It is demonstrated that these amplifiers can produce RF output power on the order of 4-6 W/mm of gate periphery with near ideal power-added efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 June 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658596","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The operation of microwave power amplifiers fabricated from wide bandgap semiconductors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The operation of microwave power amplifiers fabricated from wide bandgap semiconductors","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00604512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035544S","chronDate":"8-13 June 1997","isNumber":"13275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660","citationCount":"3","articleId":"604512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":604516,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In a prior experimental link with near-perfect impedance matching, dissipative loss in our input matching circuit prevented us from achieving a measured noise figure of less than 4 dB. Investigation of the effects of input impedance mismatch indicates that mismatch can actually lower the noise figure to below 3 dB even in the presence of some dissipative loss in the input circuit. We have verified this theory by using the mismatch effect to reduce the measured noise figure of our link to 2.5 dB at 130 MHz. We believe this is the first demonstration of amplifierless link noise figure of less than 3 dB. We confirmed the validity of our measurement technique by also measuring the noise figure of a 2.5 dB RF attenuator to be 2.5 dB.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1997.604564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1997.604564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13275","startPage":"237","endPage":"240 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4660/13275/00604564.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604564","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise figure","Impedance matching","Noise measurement","Optical amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Optical losses","Radio frequency","Circuits","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre communication","impedance matching","noise","equivalent circuits","noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input impedance conditions","noise figure minimisation","analog optical link","input impedance mismatch","dissipative loss","amplifierless optical link","measurement technique","2.5 to 4 dB","130 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Input impedance conditions for minimizing the noise figure of an analog optical link","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658639","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604564/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input impedance conditions for minimizing the noise figure of an analog optical link","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00604564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022832S","chronDate":"8-13 June 1997","isNumber":"13275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660","citationCount":"2","articleId":"604564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":604576,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhu","affiliation":["Department G\u00e9nie Electrique et G\u00e9nie InformatiqueEcole Polytechnique de Montrkal, C.P. 6079, Succ.

This contrast needs the source kurtosis to have the same sign, and is thus appropriate to multichannel blind equalization in communications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","startPage":"3453","endPage":"3456 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604607.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved contrast dedicated to blind separation in communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Improved contrast dedicated to blind separation in communications","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5751776","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved contrast dedicated to blind separation in communications","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053229S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"37","articleId":"604607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":604611,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In most wireless communications systems, directions of arrival of multipath signals need to be found for spatial selective transmission. Unfortunately, due to the coherent nature of multipath signals, it is quite difficult to find their directions of arrival. In this paper, we will present a subspace smoothing algorithm for finding the directions of arrival of multipath signals based on the mobile terminal signals received at different time instances. More importantly, we will present our experimental results to demonstrate that the spatial diversity is present for slight movements of a mobile terminal and that the subspace smoothing approach is effective in real wireless scenarios.

The subclass of such processes considered is restricted to those whose driving noise samples are statistically independent and identically distributed according to a Gaussian-mixture probability density function (PDF). Because the likelihood function for this problem is typically unbounded in the vicinity of undesirable, degenerate parameter estimates, a global maximum likelihood approach is not appropriate. Hence, an alternative approach is taken whereby a finite local maximum of the likelihood surface is sought. This approach, which is termed the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) approach, is used to obtain estimates of the AR parameters as well as the means, variances, and weighting coefficients that define the Gaussian-mixture PDF. A technique for generating solutions to the QML problem is derived using a generalized version of the expectation-maximization principle.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604632","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604632.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","startPage":"3549","endPage":"3552 vol.5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation for autoregressive Gaussian-mixture processes: the EMAX algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation for autoregressive Gaussian-mixture processes: the EMAX algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604632/","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5751798","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation for autoregressive Gaussian-mixture processes: the EMAX algorithm","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086475S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","articleId":"604632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":604639,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

One approach is based on second order cyclostationary statistics (SOCS), whereas the other exploits higher order stationary statistics (HOSS) of the received signal. While the former class of algorithms suffers from \"singular\" systems which can not be identified, the latter class is said to require an excessive number of samples of the received signal to achieve comparable performance levels. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, we demonstrate that \"singular\" systems represent a severe limitation to SOCS-based methods when it comes to the estimation of time-variant mobile radio channels from a small number of received samples. Secondly, we reveal that the approach relying on 4th order statistics yields a superior estimation performance: at a signal-to-noise-ratio of 10 dB, all channel examples can be identified from 142 samples of a GSM burst within a normalized mean square error bound of 7 per cent.","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604642.pdf","startPage":"3589","endPage":"3592 vol.5","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind identification of mixed-phase FIR systems with application to mobile communication channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Blind identification of mixed-phase FIR systems with application to mobile communication channels","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5751806","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind identification of mixed-phase FIR systems with application to mobile communication channels","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029429S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"19","articleId":"604642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":604643,"authors":[{"name":"E. de Carvalho","affiliation":["Institut EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"E.","lastName":"de Carvalho","id":"37293743600"},{"name":"D.T.M.

A novel algorithm is presented which builds on a multistep prediction (MSP) approach and can be viewed as a certain generalization of the initial linear prediction algorithm (LPA) proposed in 1994. Our algorithm improves on related works in that it is theoretically and practically unsensitive to the critical and expected problem of channel length mismatch. Moreover, the MSP scheme improves on the conventional LPA by increasing the robustness of this earlier algorithm. In contrast with the LPA, the proposed prediction scheme exploits the full channel structure, thus providing more statistical efficiency in channel identification. A direct symbol recovery algorithm (requiring no channel estimate) is also straightforwardly drawn from our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604650.pdf","startPage":"3621","endPage":"3624 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust blind channel identification and equalization based on multi-step predictors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Blind equalizers","Sensor arrays","Telecommunications","Prediction algorithms","Signal processing","Sampling methods","Nonlinear filters","Narrowband","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","telecommunication channels","equalisers","prediction theory","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust blind channel identification","equalization","multi-step predictors","oversampled channel output","linear prediction algorithm","channel length mismatch","MSP scheme","channel structure","statistical efficiency","symbol recovery algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Robust blind channel identification and equalization based on multi-step predictors","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5751813","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust blind channel identification and equalization based on multi-step predictors","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028571S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"63","articleId":"604650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":604651,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For optimal performance the form of such parameters must be known and exploited as is done in the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). In practice, the statistics required for designing the GLRT processors are not available a priori and must be estimated from limited training data. Such design is virtually impossible in general due to two major difficulties: identifying the appropriate nuisance parameters and estimating the corresponding GLRT statistics. We address this problem by using results that relate joint signal representations (JSRs), such as time-frequency and time-scale representations, to quadratic GLRT processors for a wide variety of nuisance parameters. We propose a general data-driven framework that: (1) identifies the appropriate nuisance parameters from an arbitrarily chosen finite set, and (2) estimates the second-order statistics that characterize the corresponding JSR-based GLRT processors.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604670","startPage":"3697","endPage":"3700 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604670.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven signal detection and classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven signal detection and classification","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"5751831","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604670/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven signal detection and classification","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028232S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"1","articleId":"604670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":604682,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

Optimal for stationary signals, this beamformer becomes sub-optimal for (quasi)-cyclostationary observations for which the optimal complex filters are (poly)-periodic (PP) and, under some conditions of widely linear non-circularity. Using these results and the fact that PP filtering is equivalent to FREquency SHifted (FRESH) filtering, the purpose of this paper is to present a first extension of the classical LCMV beamformer, taking into account the potential (quasi)-cyclostationarity and non-circularity properties of the observations. This new cyclic LCMV beamformer is shown to have an equivalent cyclic generalized sidelobe canceller (GSLC) structure. The performance computation of this new cyclic beamformer shows the interest of the latter in cyclostationary contexts and opens a reflection about the optimal constraint choice.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604702/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"5751853","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Constrained beamforming for cyclostationary signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained beamforming for cyclostationary signals","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032203S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"11","articleId":"604702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":604706,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

Complex Wishart and complex inverse Wishart distributed random matrices are used in applications like radar, sonar, or seismology in order to model the statistical properties of complex sample covariance matrices and complex inverse sample covariance matrices, respectively. The moments of these random matrices are often needed e.g. in studies of asymptotic properties of parameter estimates. This paper gives a derivation of the probability density function of complex inverse Wishart distributed random matrices. Furthermore, strategies are outlined for the calculation of the moments of complex Wishart and complex inverse Wishart distributed matrices.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604712.pdf","startPage":"3817","endPage":"3820 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On moments of complex Wishart and complex inverse Wishart distributed matrices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Sonar applications","Sensor arrays","Radar applications","Position measurement","Probability density function","Array signal processing","Radar signal processing","Signal processing","Seismic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","matrix inversion","random processes","signal sampling","probability","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex inverse Wishart distributed matrices","complex Wishart distributed matrices","random matrices","moments","radar","sonar","statistical properties","complex sample covariance matrices","complex inverse sample covariance matrices","asymptotic properties","parameter estimates","probability density function","signal processing","sensor arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"On moments of complex Wishart and complex inverse Wishart distributed matrices","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5751860","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On moments of complex Wishart and complex inverse Wishart distributed matrices","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055542S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"14","articleId":"604712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":604715,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Estimation of ICA is usually performed by optimizing a 'contrast' function based on higher-order cumulants. It is shown how almost any error function can be used to construct a contrast function to perform the ICA estimation. In particular, this means that one can use contrast functions that are robust against outliers. As a practical method for finding the relevant extrema of such contrast functions, a fixed-point iteration scheme is then introduced. The resulting algorithms are quite simple and converge fast and reliably.

We assume that the channel input sequence is a finite-state Markov chain and the channel output sequence is obtained from the continuous-time channel output by oversampling it at a rate higher than the channel input symbol rate, which leads to a fractionally-spaced channel equalisation problem. The objective of blind channel equalisation is to estimate the channel input symbols without explicit knowledge of the channel characteristics and the requirement of training data. The availability of multichannel outputs for the same channel input improves the reliability of the estimates. A reduced-cost blind equalisation algorithm which draws on aggregation by stochastic complementation is also proposed. A simulation example is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604771.pdf","startPage":"3929","endPage":"3932 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractionally-spaced blind channel equalisation using hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Hidden Markov models","Maximum likelihood estimation","Finite impulse response filter","Yield estimation","Parameter estimation","Noise level","Training data","Availability","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","telecommunication channels","maximum likelihood estimation","hidden Markov models","sequences","signal sampling","stochastic processes","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractionally spaced blind channel equalisation","hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood algorithm","expectation-maximisation algorithm","EM algorithm","channel input sequence","finite-state Markov chain","channel output sequence","continuous-time channel output","oversampling","channel input symbol rate","channel input symbols estimation","channel characteristics","training data","multichannel outputs","reliability","reduced cost blind equalisation algorithm","stochastic complementation","simulation","performance","aggregation","computational complexity reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fractionally-spaced blind channel equalisation using hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5751888","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractionally-spaced blind channel equalisation using hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056155S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"2","articleId":"604771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":604776,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The equalizer output corresponding to these global minima appears as a four-point constellation in the complex plane, however it is easily shown that the decomposition in its real and imaginary part provides two ISI-free versions of the transmitted signal. In the case of multi-user constant modulus algorithms, the situation is somewhat more complicated: the real and imaginary parts of each equalizer output after convergence, may correspond to different user signals. These results can be extended to other types of real input signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604778","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"3941","endPage":"3944 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the existence of undesirable global minima of Godard equalizers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Additive noise","Intersymbol interference","Blind equalizers","Cost function","Information systems","Laboratories","Communication channels","Baseband","Integrated circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","convergence of numerical methods","transient response","telecommunication channels","intersymbol interference","signal processing","pulse amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Godard equalizers","global convergence","binary input signals","2-PAM signals","complex channel impulse response","intersymbol interference","equalizer output","four-point constellation","transmitted signal","multiuser constant modulus algorithms","imaginary parts","real parts","convergence","user signals","real input signals","global minima"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the existence of undesirable global minima of Godard equalizers","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5751891","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604778/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the existence of undesirable global minima of Godard equalizers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028527S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"6","articleId":"604778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":604790,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These techniques are efficient at the up-link (mobile to base) in a mobile communication system. However, for solving the base-to-mobile beamforming problem it may be necessary to also estimate the directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of the various signal paths. We present an optimal decoupled DOA estimation procedure based on information from the blind separation algorithm. Its performance is evaluated in the presence of spatially correlated noise and array modeling errors. The proposed technique has computational advantages as compared to traditional DOA estimation, because the different signal waveforms are treated in a separated fashion.

The radar measures vertical profiles of the reflectivity and Doppler velocity of clouds, which are then telemetered to the ground for storage. Telemetry bandwidth requires that substantial real-time data processing be done on the UAV in a low-power (less than 100 watts) and small size (less than 1 cubic foot) system. A prototype was developed in less than a year, thus a flexible programmable technology was required. Although typical remote sensing radars use DSP chips, it was determined that our power, size, performance and design-time requirements were best met using FPGA technology. Our system is based on the Giga-Ops Spectrum system which uses Xilinx FPGAs on a novel modular PCI board. Unlike numerous recent FPGA-based signal processors, this presents a new class of applications and embedded system requirements. Reconfigurable capabilities are currently being explored to support radar algorithms which can adapt to a changing environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based data acquisition system for a 95 GHz W-band radar","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604849","startPage":"4105","endPage":"4108 vol.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604849.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based data acquisition system for a 95 GHz W-band radar","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5760086","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based data acquisition system for a 95 GHz W-band radar","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073837S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"2","articleId":"604849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":604850,"authors":[{"name":"V.G.

The proposed systolic array consists of L processing element (PE) arrays, where L denotes the number of levels. The proposed PE array computes only the product terms that are required for further computation in higher levels, and the outputs of lowpass and highpass filters are computed in alternate clock cycles. Therefore, the proposed architectures can compute the one-level DWT using a single architecture. Note that the proposed architectures do not require extra processing units whereas the conventional architectures need ones. The required time and hardware cost for computation of the DWT using the proposed systolic arrays are comparable to that of the conventional architectures. The proposed architectures can also be applied to subband decomposition by simply changing the filter coefficients.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13273/00604851.pdf","startPage":"4113","endPage":"4116 vol.5","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.604851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=604851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New systolic arrays for computation of the 1-D discrete wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Systolic arrays","Computer architecture","Filters","Discrete transforms","Wavelet analysis","Hardware","Costs","Very large scale integration","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic arrays","digital signal processing chips","computational complexity","wavelet transforms","transforms","low-pass filters","high-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1D discrete wavelet transform","systolic array architectures","DWT","processing element arrays","product terms","highpass filters","lowpass filters","clock cycles","hardware cost","computation time","subband decomposition","filter coefficients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/604851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"New systolic arrays for computation of the 1-D discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5760088","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New systolic arrays for computation of the 1-D discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00604851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044824S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"5","articleId":"604851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":604853,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Specifically, we compare the performance of various chip level detectors, including the chip level pilot-assisted coherent detector, chip level differential detector, chip level non-coherent detector, and the chip level maximum likelihood detector. The true union bounds on the bit error rate of these detectors were computed, with the fade rate, coding rate, and the spreading factor as parameters. It was found that these detectors are very robust against fast fading. A reasonable level of data integrity can be maintained even if the fade rate is as large as 10% of the chip rate. Among the various detectors, the pilot-aided chip level coherent detector has the best performance while the chip level differential detector is the worst. Surprisingly enough, the optimal pilot-aided detector, under the assumption of ideal interleaving, uses a transmission format that consists of an alternating pattern of pilot and coded data symbols. It was also found that chip level differential detection performs better than its symbol level counterpart only when the fade rate exceeds 6% of the chip rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of chip processing receivers for DS/CDMA systems with very fast fading","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.605162","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13277/00605162.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"100 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.605162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of chip processing receivers for DS/CDMA systems with very fast fading","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5780327","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of chip processing receivers for DS/CDMA systems with very fast fading","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00605162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035522S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"4","articleId":"605162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":605164,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Three algorithms are discussed: open loop, channel estimation, and closed loop power control. It is shown that closed loop power control with channel estimation achieves the best performance. The system capacity with perfect power control is calculated. The effect of power control imperfection on the capacity and received signal statistics is studied based on computer simulation.

Many previous works on the receivers for such systems have focused on the correlation receiver which is optimal in the single user case. However, it has been shown that the performance of the correlation receiver is unsatisfactory when there is a large number of interferers. Multiuser detection becomes an appealing method to improve the system performance. In this paper, a new multiuser detector for optical code division multiple access communication systems, referred to as the multistage decorrelating receiver, is proposed. Its structure is much simpler than the optimal multiuser detector at the expense of slight performance degradation. Both simulation and analysis of the receiver are carried out. Comparison of the proposed detector with several other receivers is also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13277/00605174.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"130 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.605174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.605174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new multiuser detector for optical code division multiple access communications systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical detectors","Multiaccess communication","Optical receivers","Multiple access interference","Decorrelation","Optical fiber communication","Multiuser detection","Degradation","Spread spectrum communication","Intensity modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical receivers","optical fibre networks","optical signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detector","optical code division multiple access communications systems","multiuser fiber-optic communication systems","receivers","correlation receiver","interferers","system performance","multistage decorrelating receiver","performance degradation","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A new multiuser detector for optical code division multiple access communications systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5780333","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multiuser detector for optical code division multiple access communications systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00605174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055272S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"5","articleId":"605174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":605175,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

This novel direction-finding method extends the array aperture without additional antennas, irregular inter-element spacings, nor any cyclic ambiguity in the final arrival angle estimates. The half-wavelength invariance yields unambiguous but high-variance DOA estimates to disambiguate low-variance but cyclically ambiguous estimates obtained using the larger invariance. This novel approach facilitates (1) multipath de-correlation (independent fading), (2) coherent summation of multipaths from the same source, and (3) down-link beamforming from the base-station to the mobile. Under one simulation scenario involving two closely spaced time-delayed multipaths in frequency-selective slow-fading, the proposed algorithm offers an impressive 80% reduction in the standard deviation and bias. Any additional computation needed by this method may be performed in parallel, thereby requiring no serious increase in the overall computational time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605177/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5780336","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sparse array spatial diversity with dual-size spatial invariances to mitigate fading-channel effects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse array spatial diversity with dual-size spatial invariances to mitigate fading-channel effects","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00605177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029248S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"4","articleId":"605177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":605180,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

By adjusting the dimension of the orthogonal signaling scheme, we trade the system error-correction capability for a faster bit rate. The increase in channel error is relieved by employing a set of quantizers which are designed using a joint source-channel optimization algorithm. The bit allocation problem of the quantizer array is solved by using a new approach based on the integer programming technique. Without bandwidth expansion, our proposed scheme results in a substantial improvement in the reconstructed image quality, especially for good channel condition.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13277/00605183.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"168 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.605183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.605183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined source-channel coding for the transmission of still images over a code division multiple access (CDMA) channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Bit rate","Image communication","Multiaccess communication","Discrete cosine transforms","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Linear programming","Bandwidth","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","image reconstruction","image coding","channel coding","source coding","discrete cosine transforms","error correction codes","optimisation","quantisation (signal)","integer programming","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","still images transmission","code division multiple access channel","discrete cosine transform","uplink","wireless IS-95 CDMA channel","orthogonal signaling scheme","system error-correction capability","bit rate","channel error","quantizer array","joint source-channel optimization algorithm","bit allocation problem","integer programming technique","reconstructed image quality","cellular radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Combined source-channel coding for the transmission of still images over a code division multiple access (CDMA) channel","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5780340","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined source-channel coding for the transmission of still images over a code division multiple access (CDMA) channel","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00605183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040953S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"3","articleId":"605183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":605195,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In an interval of duration T/sub 0/, a low rate user transmits one bit while a high rate user transmits M bits. Under the new signature sequence assignment technique, M low rate users share the signature of a single high rate user without wasting bandwidth. Based on the signature assignment technique, we propose a decorrelator that generates bit decisions for each high rate user in every subinterval of duration T/sub 0//M. In order to decode a low rate user, an orthogonal projection is applied to M separate decorrelated outputs of each low rate user. It is observed that applying a standard decorrelator to the interval of duration T/sub 0/ yields a computational complexity that grows with M. The proposed decorrelator significantly reduces the computational complexity of the standard decorrelator. Due to the structural simplicity, the proposed receiver slightly suffers in terms of bit error rate. However, it is observed that in several cases, the proposed receiver achieves the standard decorrelator performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13277/00605289.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"338 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.605289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.605289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two stage decorrelator for a dual rate synchronous DS/CDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decorrelation","Multiaccess communication","Bit rate","Decoding","Bandwidth","Detectors","Laboratories","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","correlation methods","receivers","synchronisation","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two stage decorrelator","dual rate synchronous DS/CDMA system","signature assignment technique","low bit rate user","high bit rate user","signature sequence assignment","bit decisions","orthogonal projection","computational complexity","receiver","bit error rate","decorrelator performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A two stage decorrelator for a dual rate synchronous DS/CDMA system","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5786162","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two stage decorrelator for a dual rate synchronous DS/CDMA system","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00605289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034126S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"5","articleId":"605289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":605292,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

This virtual backbone differs from the wired backbone of cellular networks in two key ways: (a) it may change as nodes move, and (b) it is not used primarily for routing packets or flows, but only for computing and updating routes. The primary routes for packets and flows are still computed by a shortest-paths computation; the virtual backbone can, if necessary provide backup routes to handle interim failures. Because of the dynamic nature of the virtual backbone, our approach splits the routing problem into two levels: (a) find and update the virtual backbone, and (b) then find and update routes. The key contribution of this paper is to describe several alternatives for the first part of finding and updating the virtual backbone. To keep the virtual backbone as small as possible we use an approximation to the minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) of the ad-hoc network topology as the virtual backbone. The hosts in the MCDS maintain local copies of the global topology of the network, along with shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13277/00605303.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"380 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.605303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.605303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing in ad-hoc networks using minimum connected dominating sets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Intelligent networks","Ad hoc networks","Spine","Network topology","Unicast","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Fault tolerance","Wireless networks","Multicast algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network routing","network topology","land mobile radio","telecommunication network management","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum connected dominating sets","virtual backbone structure","ad-hoc networks routing","fault-tolerant routing","multicast routing","unicast routing","routes updating","packet routing","packets flows","shortest-paths computation","backup routes","interim failure","approximation","network topology","local copies","global topology","network nodes","nodes movement","multihop wireless network","centralized network management system","mobile radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Routing in ad-hoc networks using minimum connected dominating sets","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5780345","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing in ad-hoc networks using minimum connected dominating sets","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00605303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032493S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"318","articleId":"605303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605308,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chao Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Chao Chao","id":"37268521600"},{"name":"Wai Chen","affiliation":["Bellcore, Morristown, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Wai Chen","id":"37279190300"},{"name":"C.

Inspection ofthe circuit topology is not sufficient to define unambiguously the transistor operating mode or the amplifier class of operation.

Existing methods for SR image reconstruction are limited by the assumptions that the input LR images are sampled progressively, and that the aperture time of the camera is zero, thus ignoring the motion blur occurring during the aperture time. Because of the observed adverse effects of these assumptions for many common video sources, this paper proposes (i) a complete model of video acquisition with an arbitrary input sampling lattice and a nonzero aperture time, and (ii) an algorithm based on this model using the theory of projections onto convex sets to reconstruct SR still images or video from an LR time sequence of images. Experimental results with real video are provided, which clearly demonstrate that a significant increase in the image resolution can be achieved by taking the motion blurring into account especially when there exists large interframe motion.","doi":"10.1109/83.605404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.605404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/13262/00605404.pdf","startPage":"1064","endPage":"1076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superresolution video reconstruction with arbitrary sampling lattices and nonzero aperture time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Superresolution video reconstruction with arbitrary sampling lattices and nonzero aperture time","volume":"6","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5663560","pubMedId":"18282997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superresolution video reconstruction with arbitrary sampling lattices and nonzero aperture time","sourcePdf":"00605404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078788S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"320","articleId":"605404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605406,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It remains an open question, however, as to which reconstruction algorithms offer the most informative images for a given set of field measurements. Commonly used time-domain beamforming techniques, and their equivalent frequency-domain implementations, are conceptually simple and stable in the presence of noise, however, large proportions of missing measurements can quickly degrade the image quality. We apply a new algorithm based on the maximum entropy method (MEM) to the reconstruction of images from sparsely sampled coherent field data. The general principles and limitations of the new method are discussed in the framework of regularization theory, and the results of monostatic imaging experiments confirm that superior resolution and artifact suppression are obtained relative to a commonly used linear inverse filtering approach.","doi":"10.1109/83.605411","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.605411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13262","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/13262/00605411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum entropy image reconstruction from sparsely sampled coherent field data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605411/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum entropy image reconstruction from sparsely sampled coherent field data","volume":"6","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5663566","pubMedId":"18283003","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum entropy image reconstruction from sparsely sampled coherent field data","sourcePdf":"00605411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041274S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"13","articleId":"605411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":605412,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is widely used for image compression, measures of the visibility of DWT quantization errors are required to achieve optimal compression. Uniform quantization of a single band of coefficients results in an artifact that we call DWT uniform quantization noise; it is the sum of a lattice of random amplitude basis functions of the corresponding DWT synthesis filter. We measured visual detection thresholds for samples of DWT uniform quantization noise in Y, Cb, and Cr color channels. The spatial frequency of a wavelet is r2/sup -/spl lambda//, where r is the display visual resolution in pixels/degree, and /spl lambda/ is the wavelet level. Thresholds increase rapidly with wavelet spatial frequency. Thresholds also increase from Y to Cr to Cb, and with orientation from lowpass to horizontal/vertical to diagonal. We construct a mathematical model for DWT noise detection thresholds that is a function of level, orientation, and display visual resolution. This allows calculation of a \"perceptually lossless\" quantization matrix for which all errors are in theory below the visual threshold. The model may also be used as the basis for adaptive quantization schemes.","doi":"10.1109/83.605413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/13262/00605413.pdf","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.605413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visibility of wavelet quantization noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Visibility of wavelet quantization noise","volume":"6","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5663568","pubMedId":"11541660","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visibility of wavelet quantization noise","sourcePdf":"00605413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036368S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"396","articleId":"605413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605430,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Flow in these microchannels has been studied theoretically and experimentally. For an effective channel diameter of 10 /spl mu/m, a channel length of 4 mm, and water as the injected fluid, the flow velocity at 11 torr is about 1.3 mm/s, delivering 100 pl in 1 s. Intermixing of chemicals, with the tissue fluid due to natural diffusion through the outlet orifice becomes significant for dwell times in excess of about 30 min, and a shutter is proposed for chronic use.

We use multicarrier modulation (also called OFDM-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) as modulation procedure to reduce the effects of ISI. We model the time variation of a stationary and ergodic frequency selective fading channel as a finite state Markov chain and we perform optimal power allocation for channel states and subchannels. In the case when the number of subcarriers is small, equalization is required; we use a recursive block MAP receiver that provides soft decisions and accounts for the residual redundancy at the vector quantizer output. This decoder is used in conjunction with a channel optimized vector quantization (COVQ) or channel matched tree structured vector quantization (CM-TSVQ) in which the VQ design is performed with respect to channel error matrices computed by simulation. When using TSVQ, the indices of the first stages of the TSVQ are transmitted on the subchannels with higher power. Results are presented for codebooks designed by using COVQ and CM-TSVQ for a Markov source; we consider a two subchannel case with equalization, and a fading channel with two equiprobable states and flat fading.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605439","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

A system is described which was used to collect simultaneous time and angle of arrival data in two indoor environments. A total of 65 data sets were taken in two buildings of different construction. The (7 GHz) data confirmed the temporal model proposed by Saleh and Valenzuela (1987), and showed a unique clustering pattern in angle, which consisted of clusters uniformly distributed in angle, with members of the clusters following a Laplacian distribution.","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

In order to test the effectiveness of various algorithms such as diversity combining, phased array processing, and adaptive array processing in an indoor environment, a channel model is needed which models both the time and angle of arrival in indoor environments. Some data has been collected indoors and some temporal models have been proposed, but no existing model accounts for both time and angle of arrival. This paper discusses existing models for the time of arrival, experimental data (form the 6.75-7.25 GHz band) that were collected indoors, and a proposed extension of the Saleh-Valenzuela model (1987), which accounts for the angle of arrival. Model parameters measured in two different buildings are compared with the parameters presented in the paper by Saleh and Valenzuela, and some statistical validation of the model is presented.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605467","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

This allowed creation of interfacial junction photocells with relatively high efficiencies. It has been recognized that those are not conventional p/n type semiconducting junction devices, but are so called donor-acceptor (D A) photocells, reminiscent of reaction centers of natural photosynthetic systems. Even more efficient photovoltaic devices have recently been fabricated with interpenetrating D-A networks which allow electron-hole separation to take place throughout the bulk of the device. In the present paper we demonstrate how these photocells can be further improved; we describe new experimental results, give general discussion of the efficiency of such devices, and analyze strategies for design of better D-A type photocells. Our recent experimental results on sensitization by inserting an excitonic layer between donor and acceptor layers multilayered structures, and by doping the D-layer by A-molecules in D(A)/A cells are briefly discussed. The organic photocell, which consists of the multilayer structure: ITO/poly(2,5-dioctyloxy-phenylenvinylene) (OOPPV)/octaethylporphine (OEP)/C/sub 60//Al, has been fabricated. Photocurrent yield spectra are interpreted by light absorption at OEP layer, exciton migration, and charge generation at both organic heterojunctions. That is, double heterojunctions of OOPPV/OEP and OEP/C/sub 60/ contribute to the charge generation by excitonic dissociation. We also report new type of \"fractal network\" photovoltaic devices made of two conducting polymers, particularly D and A derivatives of poly(phenylene vinylene). Conceptual theoretical work and modeling have been carried out to understand the ways for improvement of the device performance. Strategies to improve each step involving selective doping have been suggested to improve each step. Selective doping can provide low serial resistance and create internal electric fields for the collection of charges, while in the undoped parts excitons are effectively photogenerated. Ways to increase the effective use of absorbed photon energy and filling factor are also suggested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","volume":"44","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5674626","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Novel photovoltaic devices based on donor-acceptor molecular and conducting polymer systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel photovoltaic devices based on donor-acceptor molecular and conducting polymer systems","sourcePdf":"00605474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11521S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"70","articleId":"605474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605475,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

Two modeling approaches are considered, namely a floor-averaged propagation model and a localised area model that considers individual propagation paths for a range of potential mobile user locations. Results (measured at 1.8 GHz) show that overall system performance estimates are heavily dependent on the model used to describe the building's propagation characteristics and suggest that the former approach leads to a rather pessimistic prediction of system performance when compared with the later. This suggests that unnecessarily conservative design would be likely if the former approach was utilised as part of a system planning process.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605475","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

However, in general, much longer cell search time is required in asynchronous cell site operation than in synchronous operation. This paper proposes a fast cell search algorithm based on the periodic masking of long spreading codes. The control channel (CCH) is spread by a combination of cell site-unique long code and a short code common to all cell sites (this short code is called CSC here). The mobile station (MS) exploits the fact that the CSC periodically appears in the signals transmitted from all cell sites and can detect the long code timing (or more precisely, masking timing) by using a matched filter. To avoid searching all long codes used in the system, each cell transmits a long code group identification code (GIC) together with the CSC. This greatly reduces the cell search time. Simulation results demonstrate that cell search can be accomplished in less than about 500 ms at 90% of the locations when the number of long spreading codes (having a repetition period of 10 ms) used in the system is 512 and the number of GICs is 16.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast cell search algorithm in DS-CDMA mobile radio using long spreading codes","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The minimum reuse distance for the same pilot PN offset is derived based on pilot signal strengths. The reuse distance is a function of receiver sensitivity, propagation path loss, system configuration, search window size and hand-off parameters. It is found that the required reuse distance decreases from six times of cell radius to one cell radius, when the path loss slope increases from 20 to 50 dB/decade. The minimum pilot offset interval between two adjacent base stations is a function of propagation delay spread, hand-off parameter settings and cell distance difference. The minimum pilot separation between two adjacent cell sites will increase when the hand-off area increases. Several PN offset aliasing cases in the CDMA system deployment are discussed. Pilot PN planning strategy is also addressed. System deployment demonstrates that the established criteria are sufficient to avoid the pilot PN offset ambiguity.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1997.605497","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

When the data sequence is random, the even and odd (or polyphase) correlations are equally important. However, for most known signature sequences, only their even correlations were analyzed. It appears that determining the odd (or the polyphase) correlations is generally a very hard problem since the odd (or the polyphase) correlations depend on the phases of the signature sequences. Sole (1989), Boztas, Hammons, and Kumar (1992) found a family of quadriphase sequences that are asymptotically optimal. These sequences gain a factor /spl radic/2 in terms of their maximum periodic even correlations when compared with the best possible binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) sequences. We find the optimal phases of these sequences. The optimality is in the sense that at these phases, the mean square values of the even, odd, and the polyphase correlations are minimal, and achieve the Welch (1974) bound-equality simultaneously. Furthermore, we show that at these phases, the average user interference of these sequences is always smaller than that of the ideal random signature sequences. Comprehensive analytical and numerical results show that good phase sequences can offer a nonnegligible amount of gain over bad phase sequences at modest and high signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/18.605584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/13283/00605584.pdf","startPage":"1205","endPage":"1217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.605584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal phases for a family of quadriphase CDMA sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimal phases for a family of quadriphase CDMA sequences","volume":"43","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5625603","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605584/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal phases for a family of quadriphase CDMA sequences","sourcePdf":"00605584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041777S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","articleId":"605584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605585,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We propose and analyze an efficient bidirectional sequential decoding (BSD) technique to alleviate this drawback. In the proposed BSD, two decoders are used; one is called a forward decoder (FD), and is used to search the tree from the forward direction; while the other is called a backward decoder (BD), and is used for the backward search of the tree. Forward decoding and backward decoding are performed simultaneously, and stop whenever the FD and BD merge at a common encoder state somewhere in the tree. The relationships between backward coding and forward coding are examined in detail. Good rate 1/2 convolutional codes, with memory m ranging from 2 to 25, suitable for bidirectional decoding found through extensive computer search, are provided. These codes possess the same distance properties from both forward and backward directions. It is found, by means of extensive computer simulations as well as a heuristic argument, that the advantage of the BSD appears as a substantial decrease of the computational variability of the sequential decoding. Our findings suggest that the Pareto exponent of unidirectional sequential decoding (USD) can be practically doubled by using BSD.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5625621","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional sequential decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional sequential decoding","sourcePdf":"00605602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034481S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","articleId":"605602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":605604,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The proposed algorithm, based on the voltage control strategy, ensures the maximum torque operation over the entire field-weakening region without using the machine parameters. Also, by introducing the direct field-oriented (DFO) control, which is insensitive to the variation of machine parameters in the field-weakening region, the drive system can obtain robustness to parameter variations. Moreover, the speed sensorless control can be achieved in the very-high-speed range, where the utilization of the speed sensor is limited. Experimental results for the laboratory induction motor drive system confirm the validity of the proposed control algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605628/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","volume":"44","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5660258","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Voltage control strategy for maximum torque operation of an induction machine in the field-weakening region","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage control strategy for maximum torque operation of an induction machine in the field-weakening region","sourcePdf":"00605628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025741S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"111","articleId":"605628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":605629,"authors":[{"name":"X.Q.

The floor attribute control method needs several dozen control parameters to be tuned according to each building's traffic, and the proposed method can do it.

The machine starts smoothly with vector control at finite developed torque and then transitions to the standard direct vector-control mode with the voltage model signals as the speed begins to develop. The direct vector-control mode with voltage model uses programmable cascaded low-pass filters for flux-vector synthesis and enables the drive to operate from zero speed to field-weakening mode. As the drive speed falls to zero, the drive again transitions to start-up mode, so that it can be smoothly started again. The performance of the start-up scheme has been verified on a 100 kW electric vehicle drive.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/13284/00605639.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.605639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.605639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A start-up method for a speed sensorless stator-flux-oriented vector-controlled induction motor drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stators","Induction motors","Machine vector control","Low pass filters","Voltage","Signal synthesis","Equations","Induction motor drives","Feedback","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine control","velocity control","stators","starting","low-pass filters","control system synthesis","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drive","speed sensorless control","stator flux-oriented vector control","machine current model","programmable cascaded low-pass filters","flux-vector synthesis","100 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"A start-up method for a speed sensorless stator-flux-oriented vector-controlled induction motor drive","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5660266","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A start-up method for a speed sensorless stator-flux-oriented vector-controlled induction motor drive","sourcePdf":"00605639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030627S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"9","articleId":"605639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605641,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The analysis is based on numerical simulation of the rate equation which also takes into account the effect of lateral carrier density distribution. The amount of pulse distortion experienced within the amplifier for input pulses having energies E/sub in/=0.1 E/sub sat(in)/=0.475 pJ (where E/sub sat(in)/ is the input saturation energy of the amplifier) and E/sub in/=E/sub sat(in)/=4.75 pJ have been analyzed for each structure which has a length of 900 /spl mu/m and an input width of 1 /spl mu/m. It has been found that the TW-LDA provides higher gain saturation and hence imposes less distortion on the amplified pulse as compared with a conventional nontapered LDA. The amplified 10-ps pulse used in this study experiences almost no broadening in the TW-LDA, whereas it suffers from broadening in the conventional nontapered LDA. The carrier density distribution and the dependence of the amplifier gain on the input pulse energy have also been studied for both nontapered and tapered amplifier structures. For example, in a TW-LDA with an output width of 20 /spl mu/m and a length of 900 /spl mu/m, the exponential structure provides 9-dB improvement in saturation energy as compared with the conventional amplifier. This improvement is about 10.5 dB in linear TW-LDAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5673746","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Picosecond pulse amplification in tapered-waveguide laser-diode amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Picosecond pulse amplification in tapered-waveguide laser-diode amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00605658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04298S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"16","articleId":"605658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":605662,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The performance of the flared amplifier is evaluated considering the temporal length, the time-bandwidth product, the far field, the output energy as a function of the input energy, the injected current, and the repetition rate. While subpicosecond pulse amplification leads to strong distortions and to very low total gain, the flared amplifier is well adapted to the amplification of picosecond pulses at low-repetition rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5673750","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Picosecond pulse amplification in AlGaAs flared amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Picosecond pulse amplification in AlGaAs flared amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00605662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061136S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"5","articleId":"605662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":605663,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Capacity was defined as the maximum Erlangs of voice traffic that can be supported while limiting the total received interference and noise below a threshold, 99% of the time. In this paper, we evaluate the Erlang capacity of a CDMA system with voice and data users. The outage condition is first related to power control feasibility. It is shown that the outage condition is more stringent and hence ensures power control feasibility. The outage condition is then extended to the case of a CDMA system with voice and data users. An approximate analysis that takes into account imperfect power control, activity factors and different quality requirements is presented. Simulations are used to validate the approximate analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erlang capacity of a power controlled integrated voice and data CDMA system","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The parameter set used for modeling is taken from independent measurements on existing self-pulsating devices. Detuning of the Bragg wavelengths by current induced heating is found, and this effect is included in the model. Calculated self-pulsation characteristics were compared quantitatively with experimental results on the device. A very good correspondence between theory and experiment is obtained, e.g., for conditions generating self-pulsations and for the frequency-current dependence. Dispersive self-Q-switching thus is confirmed as the responsible mechanism for high frequency DFB type self-pulsations.

It is shown that the carrier transport slows the rise time of the probe optical power by about 10 ps, but the fall time of the probe power is not significantly slowed. However, the dynamics of the probe chirp are slowed by as much as 30-50 ps when operating at 5 Gb/s. The effect of the modified chirp dynamics due to transport is shown to give an additional dispersion penalty, but this is always less than 1 dB. Electrical feedforward of the optical signal input into the SOA is shown to improve extinction ratio of the conversion process. Carrier transport degrades performance of this scheme by up to 3 dB at high data rates. These results show that it is important to take the chirp performance of SOAs into account when designing them for long-haul communications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5673761","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The effect of carrier transport on the dynamic performance of gain-saturation wavelength conversion in MQW semiconductor optical amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of carrier transport on the dynamic performance of gain-saturation wavelength conversion in MQW semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00605674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029617S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"18","articleId":"605674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":605686,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The goal is to reduce the per-wavelength transmitter cost in both initial procurement and subsequent operation. Using photonic integration, we have addressed and resolved several important issues related to laser arrays such as wavelength accuracy, output power, high-speed modulation and optical packaging. State of the art results have been obtained. By the use of wavelength redundancy and proximity effect, wavelength deviations of /spl plusmn/0.2 nm or less from the designated eight-wavelength comb have been achieved with high yield. Simultaneous operation of ten wavelengths has also been demonstrated. In spite of the inherent splitting loss of 13 dB, high-output powers of about -13 and 0.5 dBm per wavelength have been measured, under simultaneous operation, into a single-mode fiber (SMF) without and with on-chip optical amplification, respectively. The DFB laser has a 3-dB bandwidth of 9 GHz. A 2.5-Gb/s (OC-48) error-free transmission through 120 km conventional SMF has been demonstrated under single channel operation. The electrical crosstalk from neighboring channels cause negligible degradation to the eye diagram and the bit-error-rate (BER) curve at a bit rate of 2.5 Gb/s. The optical crosstalk due to four-wave mixing and cross-gain modulation (XGM) of the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is also characterized. The impact of this integrated laser array on WDM optical networks is assessed in the conclusion.","doi":"10.1109/2944.605710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.605710","startPage":"584","endPage":"597","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/13285/00605710.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiwavelength DFB laser arrays with integrated combiner and optical amplifier for WDM optical networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multiwavelength DFB laser arrays with integrated combiner and optical amplifier for WDM optical networks","publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5673796","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605710/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiwavelength DFB laser arrays with integrated combiner and optical amplifier for WDM optical networks","sourcePdf":"00605710.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073519S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"28","articleId":"605710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":605713,"authors":[{"name":"San-Liang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"San-Liang Lee","id":"37087186833"},{"name":"M.E.

This hybrid approach is a solution to the issues stemming from the small size and odd shape of the SRM airgap, where meshing an FEM grid is difficult. In the past, the stator and rotor FEM domains kept their actual shapes, which resulted in problems with the definition of the unit outward normal vector n/spl I.oarr/ at the corner points of the SRM poles. Therefore, the normal derivative of the magnetic vector potential, i.e., the tangential component of the flux density, was undefined at these points. In this paper, a new approach with new definitions of the stator and rotor FEM domains is presented. The new concept defines the SRM airgap as a ring in which circular boundaries permit the correct definition of the normal derivative quantities and exploit the natural Neumann condition. The electromagnetic parameters of a 7.5 kW SRM prototype machine were calculated using this new approach. They compare favorably with test data. Phase magnetization characteristics also have good precision and smoothness. These electromagnetic parameters were then used to assess and compare two different SRM models for the calculation of the torque on the motor shaft, the linear trapezoidal model and the nonlinear model. The comparison between the measured torque and the torque as calculated with the two different models shows that the more simple trapezoidal model should be satisfactory in many cases and could, in particular, be used in automated SRM designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/13302/00605732.pdf","startPage":"914","endPage":"918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.605732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.605732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13302","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of the electromagnetic parameters of a switched reluctance motor using an improved FEM-BIEM-application to different models for the torque calculation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Reluctance machines","Electromagnetic modeling","Shape","Stators","Couplings","Finite element methods","Integral equations","Magnetic fields","Magnetic switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reluctance motors","machine theory","electromagnetic fields","finite element analysis","boundary-elements methods","torque","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched reluctance motor","electromagnetic parameters calculation","finite element method","boundary integral equation method","stator","rotor","airgap","natural Neumann condition","phase magnetization characteristics","7.5 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of the electromagnetic parameters of a switched reluctance motor using an improved FEM-BIEM-application to different models for the torque calculation","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5661456","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of the electromagnetic parameters of a switched reluctance motor using an improved FEM-BIEM-application to different models for the torque calculation","sourcePdf":"00605732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028829S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"36","articleId":"605732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":605733,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Without a proposed control method, both the amplitude and the direction of radial force vary in accordance with loads. These variations result in interferences of radial force commands in two perpendicular axes. The interferences become a serious problem as a load increases. A shaft finally touches down without proper compensation. It is found that a decoupling of the radial force commands can be realized with compensation of both amplitude and phase angle of four-pole motor current. A decoupling controller is proposed with the principle of a field-oriented controller of conventional induction motors. The results of experiments show the validity of compensations. It is shown that induction-type bearingless motors can be operated stably under loaded conditions, as well as transient conditions.","doi":"10.1109/28.605733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/13302/00605733.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.605733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13302","startPage":"919","endPage":"924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable operation of induction-type bearingless motors under loaded conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stable operation of induction-type bearingless motors under loaded conditions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5661457","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable operation of induction-type bearingless motors under loaded conditions","sourcePdf":"00605733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024467S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"46","articleId":"605733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605734,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

One obvious place for cost reduction is in the cost of the inverter and its associated controller. With that perspective, a novel application of the converter topology for the PMBDC known as \"C dump\" in switched reluctance motor drives is proposed in this paper. The advantages and disadvantages of this topology vis-a-vis the conventional three-phase H-bridge converter, are highlighted from the points of view of economy in switches, volt-ampere rating, associated controller cost, and packaging. Design considerations for the PMBDC are derived for use with the proposed converter topology. The operational and design characteristics of this converter-driven PMBDC drive are derived for four-quadrant performance. Guidelines for the design of the proposed topology are derived, and presented in the paper. Experimental results from a laboratory prototype are presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed PMBDC drive system.","doi":"10.1109/28.605739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.605739","endPage":"982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/13302/00605739.pdf","startPage":"973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PM brushless DC motor drive with a new power-converter topology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605739/","displayDocTitle":"PM brushless DC motor drive with a new power-converter topology","volume":"33","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5661463","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PM brushless DC motor drive with a new power-converter topology","sourcePdf":"00605739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021606S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"32","articleId":"605739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":605761,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

These are the parameters that determine the system's test scenarios. Examples are system configuration parameters, user inputs and other external events. We implemented this new method in the AETG system. The AETG system uses new combinatorial algorithms to generate test sets that cover all valid n-way parameter combinations. The size of an AETG test set grows logarithmically in the number of test parameters. This allows testers to define test models with dozens of parameters. The AETG system is used in a variety of applications for unit, system, and interoperability testing. It has generated both high-level test plans and detailed test cases. In several applications, it greatly reduced the cost of test plan development.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/13288/00605761.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/32.605761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.605761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13288","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=605761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The AETG system: an approach to testing based on combinatorial design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System testing","Application software","Telephony","Costs","Computer Society","Design for experiments","Programming","Software testing","Asynchronous transfer mode","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program testing","software tools","open systems","software cost estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AETG system","software testing","combinatorial design","system test parameters","test scenarios","system configuration parameters","user inputs","test set generation","n-way parameter combination","pairwise parameter combination","triple parameter combination","interoperability testing","unit testing","system testing","high-level test plans"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"The AETG system: an approach to testing based on combinatorial design","volume":"23","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5687450","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The AETG system: an approach to testing based on combinatorial design","sourcePdf":"00605761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04185S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"13288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"598","articleId":"605761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":605771,"authors":[{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["Parallel Processing Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Min Tan","id":"37289181900"},{"name":"H.J.

The goal is to execute subtasks on the machines in such a way that the total program execution time is minimized. A mathematical framework is presented that models the matching of subtasks to machines, scheduling of subtasks' computation, scheduling of intermachine communication steps, and selection of sources of shared data items for intermachine communication (data relocation). The goal of this work is to generate a provably optimal scheme for communicating shared data among subtasks as an enhancement to any given matching and scheduling. Initially, it is assumed that at any instant in time, only one machine is being used for program execution and only one subtask is being executed. Based on this assumption, a polynomial algorithm is introduced to optimize scheduling and data relocation with respect to any given matching of subtasks to machines. The data relocation scheme is then extended to reduce intermachine data communication time in an HC environment with a given matching and scheduling of subtasks' computation where: multiple subtasks' computations can be performed concurrently on different machines; subtask computation steps can be overlapped with other subtasks' communication steps for intermachine data transfers; and machines in the HC suite are interconnected by a shared-bus type of network.","doi":"10.1109/71.605771","startPage":"857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/13289/00605771.pdf","endPage":"871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.605771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605771/","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the application execution time through scheduling of subtasks and communication traffic in a heterogeneous computing system","volume":"8","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5695234","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the application execution time through scheduling of subtasks and communication traffic in a heterogeneous computing system","sourcePdf":"00605771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037721S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"38","articleId":"605771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":605821,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Geun Jeong","affiliation":["POSCO Center, Shinsegi Telecomm, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Geun Jeong","id":"37274431000"},{"name":"Wha Sook Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Hansung University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wha Sook Jeon","id":"37280516300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3659-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"605821","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data communication","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Protocols","Computer simulation","Speech","Research and development","Telecommunications","Electronic mail","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","data communication","land mobile radio","cellular radio","voice communication","access protocols","telecommunication traffic","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA cellular voice systems","rate-controlled data transmission","IS-95 cellular radio","protocol","control schemes","computer simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a data transmission scheme for CDMA cellular voice systems.

Here, frequency hopping is considered for its less stringent power control requirements with respect to direct sequence. In particular, the generation of side information to allow errors-and-erasures decoding of Reed-Solomon codes in frequency hopping multiple access communications is addressed. Symbols are erased following a Bayesian decision rule (BDR). New expressions are given for the erasure decision function in Rice fading conditions for both synchronous and asynchronous hopping. The performance sensitivity with respect to the Rice factor is studied, and compared to that of the ratio-threshold test (RTT). It is found that while BDR a's more robust than RTT for the synchronous case, the opposite seems to hold in the asynchronous case.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1997.605829","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

In order to increase battery life and allow low-cost mobile equipment to be effectively integrated in such a broadband system we propose the use of a separate low-rate signaling channel (SSC) on the physical layer. This additional channel has the primary function of power saving. For this purpose it takes on connection and mobility control functions as well as further tasks on broadcasting and synchronization. A new concept of a broadband TDMA system is presented, incorporating OFDM for the physical high rate data channel (D-channel) and CPFSK modulation with non-coherent detection for the low-rate SSC, whereby both channels are separated in frequency.

However, an OFDM signal has a large peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), which can result in significant distortion when transmitted through a nonlinear device, such as a transmitter power amplifier.

The number of needed pilot symbols for a desired bit error rate and Doppler frequency is highly dependent on the pilot pattern used in orthogonal frequency division multiplexed, OFDM, systems. Five different pilot patterns are analysed by means of resulting bit error rate, which is derived from channel statistics. Rearrangement of the pilot pattern enables a reduction in the number of needed pilot symbols up to a factor 10, still retaining the same performance. The analysis is general and can be used for performance analysis and design of pilot patterns for any OFDM system.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Though no \"killer application\" is known today the system design must be flexible enough to simultaneously handle different types of services (circuit switched and packet based), with different demands on quality of service (blocking, delay and throughput). Efficient handling of different mixtures of services must be a key issue, for a high capacity system. This work has been done in connection with the evaluation of candidates for the European, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). The paper studies what effects a mixed service scenario would give on the capacity of the cellular system, using different types of resource allocation. The different profiles of the services, in combination with the large amount of freedom regarding user behaviour, motivates scenario simulations. Two scenarios (speech and circuit switched data dominated) are studied. The performance is compared for different types of resource allocation schemes, in an OFDM based multiple access system. In OFDM, all resources are available in all cells as the FFT works on the total available bandwidth. This makes a multiple access system based on OFDM suitable for using together with dynamic resource allocation.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605841","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

This paper investigates one of these methods, referred to as antenna hopping, which consists in transmitting consecutive bursts of information on different antennas. Provided that the antenna branches are exposed to different multipath fading, a gain is achieved. Results from simulation of the GSM TCH/FS (full rate speech channel) reveal that the gain of hopping on two uncorrelated antennas is 2.9 dB for low speed terminals in an urban environment, and 5.4 dB for an indoor environment with semi-stationary users. The maximal gain is shown to be reduced at high cross-correlation and difference in path loss between the antenna branches. Antenna hopping combined with frequency hopping is shown to further enhance performance. With antenna hopping on two antennas, the maximal gain can be obtained by using frequency hopping on only 4 frequencies instead of 8 without antenna hopping. Finally, a comparison is made with delayed transmitter diversity, which is shown to have no essential advantages over antenna hopping at low terminal speed, which is the situation where diversity is really needed.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605857","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The receiver employs two branches of diversity, and is capable of adaptively choosing among three different diversity techniques which are implemented in a single design which we refer to as a multi-diversity receiver. It consists of a single conventional wireless digital receiver chain augmented with a few additional low-cost passive RF components and minor control circuits. We present algorithms for efficient co-phasing and equal-gain combining, as well as a novel cochannel interference-reduction combining algorithm. These are implemented in a system design simulation which conforms to the PACS (Personal Access Communication System) standard. We then present simulation link performance for selection diversity (SD), equal-gain combining (EGC) and interference-reduction combining (IRC) under Raleigh fading, flat fading with cochannel interference and selective fading conditions. The results show that EGC and IRC yield a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 1 dB and a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) improvement 4 dB-/spl sim/5.5 dB, respectively, compared with SD. The receiver also lowers the irreducible word error rate due to multipath delay spread when the Doppler shift is small. These results are compared with the results from other research.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity antenna diversity receiver suitable for TDMA handset implementation","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Different types of antennas (whips and patches) are investigated in order to see if different antennas are influenced differently by the human head. Results including a model of the human head are compared with results for the handheld in free space. The results show that for both omnidirectional like antennas and more directive antennas the correlation coefficient increase significantly in the presence of the human head and the MEG decrease significantly, but the diversity gain is nearly the same.

After introducing the system model we discuss the task of a frame-synchronization and analyze the effects of a frame offset. From this we derive an appropriate criterion to measure the performance of synchronization algorithms under multipath conditions. We examine two algorithms for frame synchronization: the first algorithm is based on an evaluation of periodic structures. Since it is completely independent of a frequency offset it may be applied for system acquisition and burst synchronization. If the requirements are very high as in terrestrial TV broadcasting a second algorithm is needed to attain sufficient accuracy. The algorithm presented for this purpose is based on the evaluation of the channel estimate, so no further training data is required.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605870","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

As a result of simulation, it is shown that the bit error rate (BER) is 3.5/spl times/10/sup -3/ at 15 dB of E/sub b//N/sub 0/ for a 32 kbit/sec data rate and 16 subchannels of the orthogonal coding multi-carrier CDMA in multi-path fading.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605886","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

To support robust frequency planning, multi-operator scenarios, system coexistence and hierarchical cell structures, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and multicarrier techniques are viable choices. Further multiple access schemes presently under discussion are code division multiple access (CDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA). A mobile radio system concept deploying a hybrid frequency and time divided code division multiple access (F/T/CDMA) scheme with a multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) component, called MC/JD-CDMA, is proposed and performance results for the uplink are presented.

In this context CDMA (code division multiple access) seems to be a promising candidate as an element of the air interface of future mobile radio systems. The combination of OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) and CDMA for mobile radio transmission has been proposed by several authors for the downlink. So far, the more elaborate uplink of such OFDM-CDMA mobile radio concepts has only been the topic of few publications, since channel estimation and data detection are more complex than in the downlink. The uplink of an OFDM-CDMA mobile radio concept is investigated. A pilot tone based channel estimation technique is proposed and several detection techniques suitable for the approach are described. Simulation results are shown for the case of a single receiver antenna as well as for dual receiver antenna diversity. The simulation results indicate that the proposed concept is well suited for future mobile radio systems.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605889","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

To achieve this, you must effectively and accurately manage your stakeholders' system requirements: the features, functions, and attributes they need in their software system. Once you agree on these requirements, you can use them as a focal point for the development process and produce a software system that meets the expectations of both customers and users. However, in real world software development, there are usually more requirements than you can implement given stakeholders' time and resource constraints. Thus, project managers face a dilemma: how do you select a subset of the customers' requirements and still produce a system that meets their needs? The authors developed a cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements and applied it to two commercial projects.","doi":"10.1109/52.605933","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Software","pdfPath":"/iel4/52/13290/00605933.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Software","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/52.605933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Software systems","Time to market","Programming","Time factors","Project management","Software development management","Engineering management","Knowledge management","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systems analysis","formal specification","cost-benefit analysis","software cost estimation","software development management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-value approach","requirement prioritizing","software development","software provider","competitive edge","customer needs","user needs","project managers","commercial projects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/605933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5700437","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements","sourcePdf":"00605933.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023185S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","isNumber":"13290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"394","articleId":"605933","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":605958,"authors":[{"name":"Weiping Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Weiping Xu","id":"37366228600"},{"name":"L.B.

The performance with quasi-coherent demodulation is analysed in AWGN and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels with and without channel coding (convolutional coding) and compared to incoherent (64-DAPSK) and coherent (64-QAM) demodulation. It is shown that in contrast to coherent demodulation, no pilot symbols are required for quasi-coherent demodulation. Using this redundancy for additional channel coding, both coherent and quasi-coherent demodulation show approximately the same performance at the same net bit rate, but due to the relatively complex channel estimation the hardware complexity is considerably higher with coherent demodulation.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605959","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

For indoor and microcellular environments wall reflections and transmissions as well as diffractions on vertical edges are considered up to the order specified by the user. 2D ray-path search algorithms have been extended to 3D in order to model macrocellular and land mobile satellite environments. For such cases, apart from multiple reflections, transmissions and vertical diffractions, the propagation simulator also takes into account single diffractions on horizontal edges and corners directly visible both from the transmitter and the receiver. Combinations of propagation mechanisms have also been considered in the simulator.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

There are two primary classes of simulation techniques, those based on Jakes' (1974) method of superimposing tones and those based on rational approximation of the Doppler spectrum. The technique described in this paper is based on rational approximation, so that it is simple to approximate WSSUS frequency selective channels (i.e., simple to generate several independent fading processes). The technique is based on the approach suggested by Castoldi, et al. (see Proceedings of 4th IEEE Personal and Indoor Mobile Radio Communication Conference, 1994), which provides efficient simulation of processes with low normalized Doppler rates. This paper contains a modified rational approximation design based on this multirate approach. The output statistics of the cyclostationary fading process are derived and the effects of various design choices are characterized. Also, a method of rapid initialization of the simulator is provided for efficient simulation of packetized radio networks. Software routines are available from the authors in electronic form for general non-profit use.","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1997.605965","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The proposed method employs lowpass filtering in a transform domain so that intercarrier interference and additive white Gaussian noise components in the received pilot signals are significantly reduced. The cutoff frequency of the transform-domain filter is dynamically selected by tracking the received pilot signals. The channel transfer function for all the subcarriers is obtained by a high-resolution interpolation realized by zero-padding and DFT/IDFT. The proposed method is applicable for all linear modulation OFDM systems. It is demonstrated with a 16QAM-OFDM system which includes both amplitude and phase modulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The hybrid acquisition is introduced by the combination of two schemes, parallel and serial acquisitions. The mean acquisition time of the proposed scheme is derived by considering both case 1 (the correct code-phase offsets are included in one subset) and case 2 (the correct code-phase offsets exist at the boundary of two subsets), which are caused by the distribution of correct code-phase offsets in the subset. Detection, false alarm, and miss probabilities are derived for the cases of multiple correct code-phase offsets and multipath Rayleigh fading channel. Results are provided for the acquisition performance with respect to design parameters such as postdetection integration length in search and verification modes, subset size, and number of I/Q noncoherent correlators. Also, comparison between the hybrid acquisition and the fully parallel acquisition is provided in terms of the minimum mean acquisition time.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Adaptive filters are known to effectively cope with both multiuser interference and multipath propagation in the case of static channels. A time-variant channel can be assumed static if the variations of the channel are slow compared with the convergence rate of the adaptive algorithm. However, in mobile communication where channels change very rapidly, this assumption is not valid. Therefore, we investigate the tracking performance of adaptive receivers in a mobile environment with realistic parameters. Different algorithms and receiver structures are compared. The results indicate that the convergence speed of the LMS algorithm is too slow. The NLMS yields good results if the velocity of the mobile is slow. The RLS yields good results if the number of users is relatively small. We propose a new adaptive multiuser receiver structure which allows one to increase the number of users.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

Trained adaptation algorithms are commonly used to adapt the receivers. Two blind adaptation algorithms, the Griffths' (1989) algorithm and the linearly constrained constant modulus algorithm (LCCMA), are proposed for this application. Simulation results show a performance greatly superior to that of the conventional receiver and close to the case of trained adaptive receivers. Blind adaptation allows for a much more flexible network design by eliminating the need for a training sequence.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

We then derive the PEP when there are channel estimation errors, and through this analysis we examine the error flooring phenomenon. We derive the PEP for colored Gaussian noise channels when we have a mismatched decoder. Using these results we gain some intuition about the role of channel time-variation, channel estimation errors and noise covariance on the performance of multisensor adaptive MLSE.

Interference suppression is achieved with an adaptive digital filter which attempts to minimize the mean squared estimation error. A model for the reverse link of a cellular system is assumed which accounts for both intra- and other-cell interference, and stochastic arrivals and departures of transmitted packets. All received signals experience both long-term shadowing and short-term Rayleigh fading. Variations on decision-directed and blind least squares adaptive algorithms are presented which are compatible with differential coding and detection. Computer simulation results are presented which compare the uncoded performance of the adaptive scheme with the conventional matched filter. These results indicate that the adaptive approach is insensitive to variations in received power (averaged over fades), and offers a significant gain in capacity (measured in Erlangs per cell) at modest to high error rates (5-15%).","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference.

The time dependent adaptive filter, which is blindly adapted using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), can reject interference by exploiting the cyclostationary and constant envelope properties of the AMPS signal. The model-based FM demodulator uses a parametric method based on forward-backward linear prediction to provide high resolution frequency estimates for distinguishing interference from the desired signal. Examples are provided showing the performance of the combination of the CMA-constrained TDAF and the model-based demodulator in various signal environments.

The results show that when /spl tau//sub d/>0.455 chip duration (T/sub c/) the performance of the PN tracking loop degrades substantially; i.e., P/sub L/>10/sup -5/.

In this article the authors start by presenting a quite general formulation of the radio resource management problem where the three key allocation decisions are concerned with waveforms (\"channels\"), access ports (or base stations), and, finally, with transmitter power. Some approaches to these problems found in the literature are reviewed. In particular, the principles of random channel allocation schemes, as found in frequency-hopping or direct-sequence CDMA systems, are compared with deterministic dynamic channel allocation schemes. The article closes by giving an outlook of some of the key problems in resource management in future wireless multimedia systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/13299/00606024.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.606024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.606024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13299","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio resource management in future wireless networks: requirements and limitations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless networks","Multimedia systems","Channel allocation","Wireless communication","Proposals","Wideband","Base stations","Radio transmitters","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","radio spectrum management","frequency allocation","multimedia communication","broadband networks","frequency hop communication","code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","personal communication networks","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio resource management","future wireless networks","market estimates","wireless personal communication","wideband multimedia services","spectrum allocations","spectrum resource management","waveforms","access ports","transmitter power","random channel allocation schemes","frequency-hopping","direct-sequence CDMA systems","deterministic dynamic channel allocation","wireless multimedia systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Radio resource management in future wireless networks: requirements and limitations","volume":"35","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5674782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio resource management in future wireless networks: requirements and limitations","sourcePdf":"00606024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055957S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"94","articleId":"606024","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":606026,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Namely, the modulated output is always considered as a 1-D signal stream, even though the recorded signals on the disc form 2-D pit-patterns. We propose a novel recording method which utilizes the 2-D nature of optical disks. With this method, which we name RPR (Radial direction Partial Response), we can use narrower track pitch for ROM systems. Using DVD equivalent optical pickup, we demonstrate that low enough error rate can be obtained with 0.45 micron track pitch and a linear recording density of 0.29 microns/bit. By adopting ZCAV (Zone Constant Angular Velocity) format, and by carefully choosing the length of sync area, the proposed method is possible to increase the capacity of conventional optical disc systems. This method read out information recorded in two adjacent tracks at the same time. The crosstalk between two adjacent tracks is removed by pre-coding. We show experimental results when this method, RPR, is applied to the SCIPER multilevel signal recording method.","doi":"10.1109/ODS.1997.606106","publicationTitle":"1997 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting ODS Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting ODS Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4804/13281/00606106.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ODS.1997.606106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial response recording in radial direction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"Partial response recording in radial direction","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658816","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial response recording in radial direction","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00606106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037619S","chronDate":"7-9 April 1997","isNumber":"13281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804","articleId":"606106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":606107,"authors":[{"name":"B.V.

We have used commercially-available mastering equipment and standard polycarbonate injection-molding techniques to manufacture compact discs of standard pitch but with individually varying pit depths. The pits have identical lengths and are written end-to-end to form a continuous groove whose depth varies over an /spl sim//spl lambda//4 range. These PDM discs can be read with standard optical reader heads using either push-pull or 3-beam tracking. We present experimental results that demonstrate our ability to manufacture multi-level pits of 0.6 /spl mu/m length, undo significant intersymbol interference, and recover the original data signal after readout by a conventional CD reader head. Additionally, results indicate that PDM continues satisfactory operation when subjected to perturbations such as defocus and disc tilt as allowed by CD specifications. Work is underway to apply PDM to optical discs with pits of DVD dimensions.","doi":"10.1109/ODS.1997.606107","publicationTitle":"1997 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting ODS Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting ODS Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4804/13281/00606107.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ODS.1997.606107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using pit-depth modulation to increase capacity and data transfer rate in optical discs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606107/","displayDocTitle":"Using pit-depth modulation to increase capacity and data transfer rate in optical discs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658817","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using pit-depth modulation to increase capacity and data transfer rate in optical discs","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00606107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029985S","chronDate":"7-9 April 1997","isNumber":"13281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804","citationCount":"2","articleId":"606107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":606109,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As a benchmark, we compare holographic memory with optical compact discs. They are both removable, high capacity, and can be randomly accessed. The next generation compact disc due in early 1997, the Digital-Versatile-Disc (DVD), will have a capacity of /spl sim/6 Gbytes per layer, for a maximum planned capacity of /spl sim/20 Gbytes per double-sided disk with two layers on each side. That translates to a surface density of approximately 20 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/ for the 4 layered DVD disk. In order for holographic 3-D disks to be competitive, we must demonstrate a much higher surface density than the most advanced DVD. A surface density of 100 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/ was achieved by storing 590000 pixels in each hologram, over an effective hologram area of 5850 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ (7.8 /spl mu/m horizontal displacement /spl times/.75 mm vertical displacement per hologram). The resulting estimated raw bit-error-rate (BER) was approximately 10/sup -4/ and no errors were observed in the sampled hologram when localized threshold values were used. At 100 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/, we have a comfortable margin over the projected surface density of the most advanced DVD system. Furthermore, the results obtained from this experiment can be applied to a shift multiplexed holographic 3-D disk system. The capacity per 120 mm disk at 100 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/ is approximately 100 Gbytes.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting ODS Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/4804/13281/00606109.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"1997 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting ODS Conference Digest","doi":"10.1109/ODS.1997.606109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ODS.1997.606109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Holographic data storage with 100 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/ density","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Holography","Memory","Holographic optical components","Displacement control","Fourier transforms","Bit error rate","DVD","Optimized production technology","Radiofrequency interference","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["holographic storage","storage media","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["holographic data storage","100 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/ density","holographic memory","optical compact discs","Digital-Versatile-Disc","DVD","surface density","effective hologram area","horizontal displacement","vertical displacement","raw bit-error-rate","localized threshold values","shift multiplexed holographic 3-D disk system","capacity","100 Gbyte","120 mm","590000 pixel","7.8 mum","0.75 mm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"Holographic data storage with 100 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/ density","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658819","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Holographic data storage with 100 bits//spl mu/m/sup 2/ density","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00606109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020941S","chronDate":"7-9 April 1997","isNumber":"13281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4804","citationCount":"3","articleId":"606109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":606112,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Micro-mechanical methods allowed the big scale fabrication of microoptical silicon lenses with methods, machines and materials of the semiconductor technology on wafer. With the simultaneous application of micro-mechanical methods, such as anodic bonding processes of optical components and semiconductor-laser heated solder bonding techniques, it was possible to realize also hybrid integrated fiberoptic subcomponents on silicon wafer with the neccessary dimensions, tolerances and mechanical stability in the submicrometer region. We have realized a technology with micro-systems that enables on an (about 1 mm sq.) chip in a silicon wafer compound the hybrid integration of complete active fiberoptic modules with their different active semiconductor chips and the micro-optics for direct coupling in and out of the SM- and MM-fibers for different applications. With this technology of a compact design of the neccessary materials and components we could assemble components as laser- and detector-modules with the highest standard of microoptical stability and reliability. With this technique we can use the already in microelectronics well-established low cost production methods on wafer scale also for active fiber optic components. This means the complete fabrication, burn-in and testing procedures are practicable for example on a 5 inch silicon-wafer. So the main module-functions are separated from the cost intensive packaging efforts. It is rather possible to provide with a standard-submount base-component a fiber optic product family for different applications with adapted packages. This means that on the base of these module-subcomponents the volume production as well of low cost as also of high end components for fiber optics are possible. As all the essential opto-electrical and mechanical functions are combined in the highly stable subcomponent chip with well adapted materials, in minimal dimensions and symmetrical design, all the derived fiber optic components can provide the imperative reliability for these products. In some examples we show proposed exploitations of these technique for highly expedient realization of fiber optic transmission systems. One very important field for application of low cost components is the access network. Fiber to the home needs medium datarates (up to 155 Mbit/s) and medium length (up to 10 km). The techniques described here allows to find the optimum between performance and cost for these applications. Using the bi-directional transmission the effort for the bit transport can be reduced near to the level of copper lines. Therefore the German Telekom has installed a lot of subscriber lines using modules for bi-directional optical transmission.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4801/13278/00606123.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1997.606123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1997.606123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microsystems and wafer processes for volume-production of highly reliable fiber optic components for telecom- and datacom-application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Costs","Optical device fabrication","Silicon","Optical materials","Semiconductor materials","Optical design","Laser stability","Materials reliability","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","telecommunication network reliability","micromechanical devices","optical fibre subscriber loops","optical fibre fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microsystem","silicon wafer process","volume production","fiber optic component","telecoms","datacoms","micromechanical fabrication","reliability","active semiconductor chip","hybrid integration","access network","fiber to the home","burn-in testing","subscriber line","bi-directional transmission","package","micro-optical lens","anodic bonding","laser heated solder bonding","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Microsystems and wafer processes for volume-production of highly reliable fiber optic components for telecom- and datacom-application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5709557","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microsystems and wafer processes for volume-production of highly reliable fiber optic components for telecom- and datacom-application","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039575S","chronDate":"18-21 May 1997","isNumber":"13278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4801","citationCount":"3","articleId":"606123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":606158,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

These devices are integrated on-chip with refractive microlenses, resulting in components that can be used directly in systems, without the need for external optics. A single-mode dielectrically-apertured VCL of diameter 3.1 /spl mu/m integrated with a microlens, has a far-field divergence half-angle of /spl sim/1 degree, allowing for an interconnect length of /spl sim/5 mm. VCLs of this size have bandwidths /spl sim/15 GHz at powers /spl sim/1 mW, suitable for high-speed optical interconnects. We have studied the tolerance of the free-space link to mechanical misalignments and to fabrication variations by evaluating the power throughput and crosstalk from adjacent channels positioned on a 250 /spl mu/m pitch.

The experiments were performed on bumped and unbumped die. They were assembled onto bare ITO-glass and FR-4 substrates. The reason for using the transparent glass substrate is that the particle deformation and settlement can be visualised without destroying the assembled module. The temperature ramp rates studied ranged between 8.1 and 65.7/spl deg/C/s. The experiments show that the best joint quality is obtained when a slow temperature ramp rate is applied to unbumped dies. A good joint is achieved when many particles have been entrapped on the die pad and when there is a significant degree of particle deformation. A large degree of deformation of particles results in a large contact area for the electrical conduction path. When a high temperature ramp rate is applied, there is a risk that the adhesive is already cured before full compression is reached. This will prevent the particles in the adhesive from contacting the bonding surface. When assembling bumped die, the temperature ramp rate does not seem to have a significant influence on the result. The joint quality evaluation has been performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Microscopy (OM). Furthermore, temperature cycling between -40 to +125 /spl deg/C, 1000 cycles, has been performed to characterise the joint reliability under the optimum temperature ramp rate conditions. The electrical resistance has been measured continuously. A theoretical simulation of the influence of the temperature ramp rate on the adhesive joint quality has been performed using the same test module conditions as for the experimental work. The results coincide with the experimental results, particularly in the range of low bonding pressure values.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Optical microscopy","Assembly","Scanning electron microscopy","Contacts","Bonding","Performance evaluation","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Conductive adhesives","Glass"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-chip devices","adhesion","conducting materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature ramp rate","flip-chip joint","scanning electron microscopy","anisotropically conductive adhesive","FR-4 substrate","optical microscopy","temperature cycling","transparent ITO glass substrate","particle deformation","contact area","bumped die","bonding surface","electrical resistance","unbumped die"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1997.606224","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4801/13278/00606224.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1997.606224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of temperature ramp rate on flip-chip joint quality and reliability using anisotropically conductive adhesive on FR-4 substrate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effect of temperature ramp rate on flip-chip joint quality and reliability using anisotropically conductive adhesive on FR-4 substrate","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606224/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5704099","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of temperature ramp rate on flip-chip joint quality and reliability using anisotropically conductive adhesive on FR-4 substrate","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063048S","chronDate":"18-21 May 1997","isNumber":"13278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4801","citationCount":"3","articleId":"606224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":606237,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Miniaturization, increased product function and performance are driving the need for higher component density and improved component performance. Eventually component density and performance requirements will force hand held product manufacturers to integrate the passive components within the printed wiring board (PWB). This paper is the work of the Passive Component Technology Working Group (P-TWG) of the National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI). NEMI is a privately funded initiative created to promote collaborative development by industry, government and academia of the underlying technology and infrastructure required to facilitate manufacture of new high-technology electronic products in North America. The obstacles which must be overcome to implement integral passives are very significant. First of all, integral passives will profoundly change the design process and much characterization and modeling must be done to allow designers to easily transition from use of discretes to integral passives. Since passives will become part of the PWB process, tools and methods must also be developed which reduce the added turnaround time which will probably be required to make design changes in boards using integrated passives. Since a high density interconnection substrate is an inherent primary element and the essential part of the manufacturing process of integral passive components, a vital forward thinking interconnect substrate and passive component industry is essential to reclaiming the electronics manufacturing infrastructure. Electronic design engineers, passive component and interconnection substrate manufacturers together have an opportunity to create this new manufacturing infrastructure. The ultimate objective of this new paradigm is to point the way towards smaller, faster and less expensive electronic products that get to market first and perform reliably for their consumers.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1997.606249","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4801/13278/00606249.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1997.606249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated and integral passive components: a technology roadmap","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606249/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated and integral passive components: a technology roadmap","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5704124","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated and integral passive components: a technology roadmap","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028973S","chronDate":"18-21 May 1997","isNumber":"13278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4801","citationCount":"23","articleId":"606249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":606318,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Three power distribution approaches have been analyzed and compared.

The application vehicle chosen to demonstrate this concept is a typical flip-chip electronic package. First, the thermal calculations are performed by solving the steady heat conduction equation in a three dimensional domain. The temperature profiles and chip-to-case thermal resistances are obtained for different number and sizes of thermal vias. This thermal data set is used to \"train\" an ANN model. Our \"simple to complex\" and simultaneous testing and training procedure is used to develop an appropriate network with best predictive capabilities. Then, an algebraic expression for the electrical wiring density on the chip is derived as a function of the via number and size for a typical wiring layout. Using this expression along with the ANN model for the thermal resistance, we illustrate a method where the maximum wiring density is determined for a prescribed chip-to-case thermal resistance.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1997.606322","pdfPath":"/iel3/4801/13278/00606322.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1169","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings 47th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1997.606322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization for thermal and electrical performance for a flip-chip package using physical-neural network modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimization for thermal and electrical performance for a flip-chip package using physical-neural network modeling","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5704155","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization for thermal and electrical performance for a flip-chip package using physical-neural network modeling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084869S","chronDate":"18-21 May 1997","isNumber":"13278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4801","citationCount":"2","articleId":"606322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":606327,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Both the evolution of defect contributions located in the optically active layer as well as modifications of the interband contribution of the spectrum can be used as a measure of the aging status of an individual LDA. Thus we introduce a new, fast and nondestructive method for the assessment of high power LDA.

The parameters of interest include the temperatures and moisture contents of the soil and canopy. To evaluate the feasibility of the retrieval approach, the authors conduct two case studies. The first study is based on products from the 1dH/R model that are used for the model validation. The second study is based on results from a 60-day summer dry-down run of the 1dH/R model with a vegetation coverage of 100%. In each case, they utilize about 95% of the 1dH/R model predictions to train the DLNN and the rest of the predictions are used to evaluate the DLNN retrievals. The training data include horizontally and vertically-polarized, brightnesses at 1.4, 19, and 37 GHz, and the corresponding temperatures and moisture contents of the soil and canopy. In the first study, they find that differences between DLNN retrievals and desired quantities (1dH/R model products) are less than 0.1 Kelvin for the canopy temperature, 1.2 Kelvins for the soil temperature (uppermost 5 mm), 0.0001 kg/m/sup 2/ for the canopy water content, and 1.2% for the soil moisture content (by volume). In the second study the corresponding differences are smaller as expected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606362/","accessionNumber":"5745311","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-8 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Retrieval of soil moisture using a dynamic learning neural network trained with a 1-dimensional hydrology/radiobrightness model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrieval of soil moisture using a dynamic learning neural network trained with a 1-dimensional hydrology/radiobrightness model","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00606362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033774S","chronDate":"3-8 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4810","articleId":"606362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":606397,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

Whereas, in military radar utilization of complete polarization scattering matrix radars is not yet fully accepted, in remote sensing on the other hand, radar polarimetry seems to have been accepted as an indispensable tool, and convincing results have been obtained for geo-environmental applications in agriculture, forestry, hydrology, flood plain and rural infrastructure maintenance, volcanology and seismology, archeology, etc. However, there still exists a large void in standardization and proper handling of basic and applied polarimetric theory and concepts. In this paper a succinct assessment of the current state-of-the-art is presented summarizing the basic polarimetry concepts spelled out in Boerner et al. (1997).

Furthermore, sampling circuits can be used to alleviate the timing and bandwidth limitations of one-step converters such as flash and interpolative architectures. This paper describes design techniques for sample-and-hold circuits utilized in high-speed low-voltage data converters, Following a review of the role of sampling in various converter architectures, two broad categories of sampling techniques are introduced and properties of basic analog switches are summarized. Next, conventional sampling architectures are discussed, design methods for CMOS, bipolar, and BiCMOS implementations are studied, and several examples embodying these methods are presented. Finally, characterization of high-speed sampling circuits is described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5709266","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of sample-and-hold amplifiers for high-speed low-voltage A/D converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of sample-and-hold amplifiers for high-speed low-voltage A/D converters","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029422S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1997","isNumber":"13308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814","citationCount":"43","articleId":"606585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":606588,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Our experimental results show that the patterns generated by our approach produce on the average a lower bound on the maximum power which is 41% tighter than the one obtained by weighted random patterns for estimating the maximum power. Also, our lower bound for the maximum instantaneous current is 21% tighter as compared to the weighted random patterns.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1997.606601","startPage":"135","endPage":"138","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4814/13308/00606601.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1997.606601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of maximum power and instantaneous current using a genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Power dissipation","Delay","Circuit simulation","Automatic test pattern generation","Sequential circuits","Timing","Power generation","Runtime","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","sequential circuits","combinational circuits","genetic algorithms","timing","delays","circuit analysis computing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power estimation","instantaneous current estimation","genetic algorithm","maximum power dissipation","supply lines","CMOS circuits","large combinational circuits","large sequential circuits","timing information extraction","current information extraction","transistor-level gate-level simulation","general-delay gate-level simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of maximum power and instantaneous current using a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1997","accessionNumber":"5709282","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of maximum power and instantaneous current using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099028S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1997","isNumber":"13308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814","citationCount":"42","articleId":"606601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":606608,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A new scheme is devised for a detailed edge detector, which is to seek horizontal and vertical edges simultaneously. A new concept is also introduced into a PE (Processing Element) array so as to be commonly used by the vector quantizer and the motion estimator. Owing to a sophisticated architecture, these CODEC facilities have been implemented in 72.24 mm/sup 2/ by a 0.6 /spl mu/m triple-metal CMOS technology, which can enable the visual communication of QCIF (176/spl times/144) 10 fps pictures at a bitrate below 30 K bps.

In this paper, we propose a highly efficient VLSI architecture for the 1-D DWT decomposition. This architecture contains two stages of systolic decimation filter banks to guarantee a high throughput and an optimal computation time. Using this architecture, N-point samples with J resolution levels can be computed in N clock cycles spending only JL registers, where L denotes filter length. Due to its regular structure, this architecture can be easily scaled up with the tap size of the filters and the number of octaves. The performance of the proposed architecture will be verified by the successful implementation of a 4-tap 3-octave DWT VLSI chip.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of a highly efficient VLSI architecture for discrete wavelet transform","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1997.606620","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1997.606620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13308","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4814/13308/00606620.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of a highly efficient VLSI architecture for discrete wavelet transform","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730284","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of a highly efficient VLSI architecture for discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041732S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1997","isNumber":"13308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814","citationCount":"8","articleId":"606620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":606624,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuting Huang","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"lastName":"Qiuting Huang","id":"37086990557"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"606624","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"abstract":"In radio communication applications, the important specifications for a local oscillator are oscillation amplitude, phase-noise, and power consumption.

The consequence is the down scaling of the power supply voltages, to date even lower than 2 V, with almost the same threshold voltages of the CMOS transistors. Those low voltages mean that some widespread techniques such as switched-capacitors cannot be implemented anymore. On the other hand custom integrated circuits require continually higher speeds, more accuracy and less power drain. In the first section, the impact of mismatch or accuracy in analog circuits and the impact on power drain is discussed. Secondly, in section two some fundamental limitations of analog integrated circuit design in the trade-off between speed, accuracy and power drain are analysed. In the third section the problem of very low voltage signal processing in switched-capacitor circuits is studied. Some solutions, such as the switched-opamp technique are presented, and the technique is demonstrated by the design of a very low power, low voltage sigma delta modulator. The design and the measurements of 12 bit sigma delta AD converters running at 1.5 V power supply voltage and consuming less than 100 /spl mu/W in standard CMOS technology are finally discussed.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1997.606631","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4814/13308/00606631.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1997.606631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Custom analog low power design: the problem of low voltage and mismatch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606631/","displayDocTitle":"Custom analog low power design: the problem of low voltage and mismatch","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5730295","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Custom analog low power design: the problem of low voltage and mismatch","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033258S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1997","isNumber":"13308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814","citationCount":"35","articleId":"606631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":606638,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Left-to-right multipliers are significantly faster than conventional right-to-left multipliers because they do not require a carry-propagate adder to complete the multiplication process. The key to the high speed of left-to-right multiplication is the fact that the most significant partial product digits are available in carry-save form earlier than they are in conventional right-to-left multipliers. Two conversion schemes for converting the most significant half of the partial products from carry-save to binary form are described. The first scheme uses a variation of the Ercegovac-Lang converter, and the second scheme uses a conventional carry-select adder. Experimental measurements are presented to show the feasibility of 200-MHz operation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of a 200-MHz 16/spl times/16 left-to-right carry-free multiplier in 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology for next-generation DSPs","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1997.606669","startPage":"469","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1997.606669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13308","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4814/13308/00606669.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of a 200-MHz 16/spl times/16 left-to-right carry-free multiplier in 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology for next-generation DSPs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5709308","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of a 200-MHz 16/spl times/16 left-to-right carry-free multiplier in 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology for next-generation DSPs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026281S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1997","isNumber":"13308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814","citationCount":"14","articleId":"606669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":606670,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

This requires that the transistor threshold voltages be reduced as well to maintain adequate performance and noise margins. However, this increases the subthreshold leakage current of p and n MOSFETs, which starts to offset the power savings obtained from power supply reduction. This problem will worsen in future generations of technology, as threshold voltages are reduced further. In order to overcome this, we propose a design technique that can be used during logic design in order to reduce the leakage current and power. We target designs where parts of the circuit are put in \"standby\" mode when not in use, which is becoming a common approach for low power design. The proposed design changes consist of minimal overhead circuitry that puts the circuit into a \"low leakage standby state\", whenever it goes into standby, and allows it to return to its original state when it is reactivated. We give an efficient algorithm for computing a good low leakage power state. We demonstrate this method on the ISCAS-89 benchmark suite and show leakage power reductions of up to 54% for some circuits.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1997.606670","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of CICC 97 - Custom Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4814/13308/00606670.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1997.606670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13308","startPage":"475","endPage":"478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A gate-level leakage power reduction method for ultra-low-power CMOS circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A gate-level leakage power reduction method for ultra-low-power CMOS circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606670/","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5715995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A gate-level leakage power reduction method for ultra-low-power CMOS circuits","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00606670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024615S","chronDate":"5-8 May 1997","isNumber":"13308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814","citationCount":"155","articleId":"606670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":606675,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Such an estimate is required by most 3-D to 2-D registration and tracking methods that can efficiently refine an initial value by numerical optimization to precisely recover 3-D pose. However the analytic computation of an initial pose guess requires the solution of an extremely complex correspondence problem that is due to the large number of topologically distinct aspects that arise when a three dimensional opaque object is imaged by a camera. Hence general analytic methods fail to achieve real-time performance and most tracking and registration systems are initialized interactively or by ad hoc heuristics. To overcome these limitations we present a novel method for approximate object pose estimation that is based on a neural net and that can easily be implemented in real-time. A modification of Kohonen's self-organizing feature map is systematically trained with computer generated object views such that it responds to a preprocessed image with one or more sets of object orientation parameters. The key idea proposed here is to choose network topology in accordance with the representation of 3-D orientation. Experimental results from both simulated and real images demonstrate that a pose estimate within the accuracy requirements can be found in more than 81% of all cases. The current implementation operates at 10 Hz on real world images.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606781","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13316/00606781.pdf","startPage":"3232","endPage":"3237 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time pose estimation of 3D objects from camera images using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Real-time pose estimation of 3D objects from camera images using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5685150","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time pose estimation of 3D objects from camera images using neural networks","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00606781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038443S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"14","articleId":"606781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":606783,"authors":[{"name":"N.L.

This paper describes some work to verify the suitability of a new sensor as a landmark detector for a mobile robot. The landmarks that we are investigating are plants. An ultrasonic sensor continually transmits a frequency modulated signal. Echoes detected by a second transducer are demodulated with the transmitted signal to produce audio tones which are proportional to range. The spectrum of these tones is determined by the geometry of the object. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used to recognise plants. This paper discusses a series of experiments that prove that the machine perception system is independent of the range, size, and the orientation of the plant. This system has potential applications in industrial and office robots.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606783","startPage":"3244","endPage":"3249 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13316/00606783.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of plants with CTFM ultrasonic range data using a neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Mobile robots","Intelligent robots","Artificial neural networks","Service robots","Robotics and automation","Humans","Data mining","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","ultrasonic applications","pattern recognition","acoustic signal processing","neural nets","distance measurement","frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plant recognition","CTFM ultrasonic range data","US sensor","neural network","mobile robot","landmark detector","ultrasonic sensor","frequency modulated signal","FM signal","artificial neural network","machine perception system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of plants with CTFM ultrasonic range data using a neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5685152","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of plants with CTFM ultrasonic range data using a neural network","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00606783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024388S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"3","articleId":"606783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":606784,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

The second study optimizes the total volume of well conditioned workspace by maximizing a global condition index. The global condition index is a function of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix, providing a means of measuring the amplification error between the actuators and the end effector. Both objective functions involve an integration over the workspace of the manipulator.

Our strategy to determine a processor for their execution is to exploit the quasi regularity property in their dependence graph representations in search for what we call the Jacobi processor. This processor emerges from an exploration iteration which takes off from a processor template and a set of Jacobi algorithms. Based on qualitative and quantitative performance analysis, both the algorithms and the processor template are restructured towards improved execution performance. To ensure the mapper is part of the emerging processor specification, the algorithm-to-processor mapping method is included in the iterative and hierarchical exploration method. Processor's hierarchy exploits properties related to regularity in the algorithm's structure, allows gentle transitions from regular to irregular levels in the algorithm hierarchy and offers different control models for the irregular structures that appear at deeper levels of the hierarchy. Transformations aiming at reducing critical paths, increasing throughput, improving mapping efficiency and minimizing control and flow overheads are essential. They include retiming, pipelining and lookahead techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1997.606812","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4817/13318/00606812.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1997.606812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A strategy for determining a Jacobi specific dataflow processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A strategy for determining a Jacobi specific dataflow processor","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5685243","publicationDate":"1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jul 1997","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A strategy for determining a Jacobi specific dataflow processor","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00606812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072862S","chronDate":"14-16 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4817","citationCount":"17","articleId":"606812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":606814,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hau Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Hau Yeh","id":"37344219400"},{"name":"Chen-Yi Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Yi Lee","id":"37280413800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7959-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-0511"}],"articleNumber":"606814","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Very large scale integration","Hardware","Computer architecture","Focusing","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Cost function","Pattern matching","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","motion estimation","computer vision","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer size optimization","full-search block matching algorithms","VLSI architectures","optimized buffer size","dependency graph analysis","internal buffer size","I/O bandwidth constraint","systematic design procedure"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents how to find optimized buffer size for VLSI architectures of full-search block matching algorithms.

The implementation requires a standard CORDIC module plus a module to compute the direction of rotation, this being the same hardware required for the extended CORDIC vectoring, recently proposed by the authors. Although these functions can be obtained as a special case of this extended vectoring, the specific algorithm we propose here presents two significant improvements: (1) it achieves an angle granularity of 2/sup -n/ using the same datapath width as the standard CORDIC algorithm (about n bits, instead of about 2n which would be required using the extended veetoring), and (2) no repetitions of iterations are needed. The proposed algorithm is compatible with the extended vectoring and, in contrast with previous implementations, the number of iterations and the delay of each iteration are the same as for the conventional CORDIC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1997.606820","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4817/13318/00606820.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1997.606820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CORDIC-based computation of ArcCos and ArcSin","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"CORDIC-based computation of ArcCos and ArcSin","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5685251","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CORDIC-based computation of ArcCos and ArcSin","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00606820.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050388S","chronDate":"14-16 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4817","citationCount":"8","articleId":"606820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":606821,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

This method provides a closed form solution for the table entries and can be applied to a variety of elementary functions.

Rotations are the basic operation in many high performance adaptive filtering schemes as well as numerous other advanced signal processing algorithms relying on matrix decompositions. To improve the efficiency of these methods, we propose to use \"approximate rotations\", whereby only a few (i.e. r/spl Lt/b, where b is the operand word length) elementary angles of the original CORDIC sequence are applied, so as to reduce the total number of required shift add operations. This seamingly rather ad hoc and heuristic procedure constitutes a representative example of a very useful design concept termed \"approximate signal processing\" recently introduced and formally exposed by S.H. Nawab et al. (1997), concerning the trade-off between system performance and implementation complexity, i.e. between accuracy and resources. This is a subject of increasing importance with respect to the efficient realization of demanding signal processing tasks. We present the application of the described rotation schemes to QRD-RLS filtering in wireless communications, specifically high speed channel equalization and beamforming, i.e. for intersymbol and co-channel/interuser interference suppression, respectively. It is shown via computer simulations that the convergence behavior of the scheme using approximate Givens rotations is insensitive to the value of r, and that the misadjustment error decreases as r is increased, opening zip possibilities for \"incremental refinement\" strategies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Adaptive filters","Matrix decomposition","Signal design","System performance","Application software","Filtering","Wireless communication","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","matrix decomposition","signal processing","digital arithmetic","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotation operations","high performance QRD-RLS filtering","Givens rotations","CORDIC algorithm","high performance adaptive filtering","signal processing algorithms","matrix decompositions","approximate rotations","heuristic procedure","approximate signal processing","implementation complexity","rotation schemes","QRD-RLS filtering","wireless communications","beamforming","intersymbol","interuser interference suppression","computer simulations","convergence behavior","misadjustment error","incremental refinement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606823","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1997.606823","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4817/13318/00606823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1997.606823","startPage":"162","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13318","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient implementation of rotation operations for high performance QRD-RLS filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient implementation of rotation operations for high performance QRD-RLS filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jul 1997","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5685254","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient implementation of rotation operations for high performance QRD-RLS filtering","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00606823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051294S","chronDate":"14-16 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4817","citationCount":"14","articleId":"606823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":606829,"authors":[{"name":"P.-Y.

The algorithms are represented as Kahn graphs with the functionality of the nodes being coarse-grain functions. We have implemented an architecture simulation environment that permits the definition of dataflow architectures as a composition of architecture elements, such as functional units, buffer elements and communication structures. The abstract, clock-cycle accurate simulator has been built using a multi-threading package and employs object oriented principles. This results in a configurable and efficient simulator. Algorithms can subsequently be executed on the architecture model producing quantitative information for selected performance metrics.

Orthogonal single-wavelet transforms being based on one scaling function and one wavelet function are used for denosing of signals. Orthogonal multiwavelets are based on several scaling functions and several wavelets. Since they allow properties like regularity, orthogonality and symmetry being impossible in the single-wavelet case, multiwavelets are well suited bases for image compression applications. With respect to an efficient implementation of these orthogonal wavelet transforms approximating the exact rotation angles of the corresponding orthogonal wavelet lattice filters by using very few CORDIC-based elementary rotations reduces the number of shift and add operations significantly.

Our path planning approach is flexible due to the automatic generation and removal of via points based on the complexity of the domain of the path planning process, efficient due to the use of the necessary via points for the path representation at all times, and massively parallel due to the parallel computation of motions of via points with only local information.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606887","startPage":"3565","endPage":"3570 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13316/00606887.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collision-free path planning with neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Neural networks","Simulated annealing","Computer networks","Intelligent robots","Concurrent computing","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Propulsion","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","path planning","multilayer perceptrons","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision-free path planning","neural networks","elastic strings","obstacles","potential field","multilayered neural network","simulated annealing","local minima"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Collision-free path planning with neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5691362","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collision-free path planning with neural networks","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00606887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043133S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"14","articleId":"606887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":606894,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

It is inspired by recent motion planning research and explicitly takes into account constraints due to joint limits and self-collisions. Central to our approach is the novel notion of kinematic roadmap for a manipulator. The kinematic roadmap captures the connectivity of the configuration space of a manipulator in a finite graph like structure. The standard formulation of inverse kinematics problem is then solved using this roadmap. Our current implementation, based on Ariadne's clew algorithm, is composed of two sub-algorithms: EXPLORE, a simple algorithm that builds the kinematic roadmap by placing landmarks in the configuration space; and SEARCH, a local planner that uses this roadmap to reach the desired end-effector configuration. Our implementation of SEARCH is an extremely efficient closed form solution, albeit local, to inverse kinematics that exploits the serial kinematic structure of serial manipulator arms. Initial experiments with a 7-DOF manipulator have been extremely successful.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion planning based approach for inverse kinematics of redundant robots: the kinematic roadmap","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606894","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13316/00606894.pdf","startPage":"3609","endPage":"3614 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=606894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/606894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A motion planning based approach for inverse kinematics of redundant robots: the kinematic roadmap","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5691369","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion planning based approach for inverse kinematics of redundant robots: the kinematic roadmap","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00606894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059171S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"13","articleId":"606894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":606922,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The idea of using the neural network technique to predict the future behaviour of a time series of the vertical-incidence ionospheric data has been presented and endorsed in the framework of the COST 251 project. It is based on the well-known fact that in recent years attention has turned to the application of neural network techniques to analysing and predicting the behaviour of non-linear time series. In particular, the behaviour of time series of the solar-terrestrial data such as the solar sunspot number, the solar 10.7 cm flux, and the geomagnetic activity indices.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970323","startPage":"27","endPage":"30 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Tenth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation (Conf.

Then we outline the adaptation needed to the classic FDTD grid calculation to isolate only one edge diffraction. We present the results obtained through a parametric study concerning the conductivity, the permittivity, the observation distance and the apex angle of the wedge. Agreement is very good in most cases, whatever the complex permittivity, and in particular the relevance of the new diffraction coefficient is demonstrated. A very interesting result as well is that the closer the observation point to the apex the better is the agreement between UTD and FDTD.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970384","publicationTitle":"Tenth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation (Conf.

During \"rush hours\" high blocking rates have already been observed in densely populated regions. To increase the network's capacity in such areas, base stations with antennas below roof-top level and limited cell radii are used. For these urban pico or micro cells wave propagation effects along street canyons are often dominant. The need for an accurate wave propagation model to calculate the contribution of those signal paths arises. This paper introduces a new deterministic algorithm which is able to calculate multiple diffracted and reflected paths using imaging techniques. Emphasis is put on the efforts made to reduce the problem's complexity since a straight forward application would suffer from enormous computing time and memory requirements and not be feasible for urban micro or pico cells. The new imaging approach is opposed to a simple ray tracer, which is restricted to diffraction phenomena. Comparisons with DCS1800 measurements show notable improvements of the field strength prediction and indicate that signal paths consisting of a combination of diffraction and reflection are important contributions to the received signal. From the evaluation it can be concluded that even for base station heights above the mean building height in NLOS (non-line-of-sight) situations considerable signal power propagates along around building paths.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970389","publicationTitle":"Tenth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation (Conf.

The method uses a modified semi-continuous HMM (SCHMM) for integration and recognition. Our results show substantial improvements over earlier integration methods at high noise levels. Our integration method relies on the assumption that, as environmental conditions deviate from those under which training occurred, the underlying probability distributions also change. We use phoneme-based SCHMMs for classification of isolated words. The probability models underlying the standard SCHMM are Gaussian; thus, low probability estimates tend to be associated with high confidences (small differences in the feature values cause large proportional differences in probabilities, when the values are in the tail of the distribution). Therefore, during classification, we replace each Gaussian with a scoring function which looks Gaussian near the mean of the distribution but has a heavier tail. We report results comparing this method with an audio-only system and with previous integration methods. At high noise levels, the system with modified scoring functions shows a better than 50% improvement; however, recognition does suffer when noise is low. Methods which can adjust the relative weight of the audio and visual information can still potentially outperform the new method, provided that a reliable way of choosing those weights can be found.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607020","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

The second step is to allow the deformable template to converge using standard techniques. The multi-model approach is significantly more flexible than single-model approaches and consistently provides better solutions. We present examples of single and multiple template solutions which support this statement.

We solve the problem of recognition by means of two mutually recursive functions. The first one uses an auxiliary retrieval function to obtain lexicalized (already built) solutions to the problem, and merges these solutions with the ones built by the second function. This second one describes the acoustical and semantic recognition process as a search problem defined with the help of the first function, and solved with the help of the A* strategy. As a linguistic model, we use a hierarchy of linguistic levels each of which has a particular meaning structure, a lexicon of lexicalized forms, their lexicalization probabilities, and a local lexical grammar describing how the semantic categories of the level can be built. The process can further be optimized if targets, constraints on the possible solutions, are given to the recognition process to guide and restrict it. Target guidance implies a mechanism for target focusing, locally matching targets to the recognition state, and target prediction with the help of a lexical local grammar. We are testing the architecture in a DARPA RM-like application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-level lexical-semantics based language model design for guided integrated continuous speech recognition","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

Generally, the elimination of n-grams with very low counts is believed to not significantly affect model performance. This project investigates the degradation of a trigram backoff model's perplexity and word error rates as bigram and trigram cutoffs are increased. The advantage of reduction in model size is compared to the increase in word error rate and perplexity scores. More importantly, this project also investigates alternative ways of excluding bigrams and trigrams from a backoff language model, using criteria other than the number of times an n-gram occurs in the training text. Specifically, a difference method has been investigated where the difference in the logs of the original and backed off trigram and bigram probabilities is used as a basis for n-gram exclusion from the model. We show that excluding trigrams and bigrams based on a weighted version of this difference method results in better perplexity and word error rate performance than excluding trigrams and bigrams based on counts alone.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607084","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

This sets the stage for a complex problem with a solution that targets optimal topological connections, routing, and link capacity assignments. These assignments must minimize cost while satisfying traffic requirements and keeping network delays within permissible values. Since such a problem is NP-complete, developers must use heuristic techniques to handle the complexity and solve practical problems with a modest number of nodes. One heuristic technique, genetic algorithms, appears to be ideal to handle the design of mesh networks with capability of handling discrete values, multiobjective functions, and multiconstraint problems. Existing applications of genetic algorithms to this problem, however, have only optimized the network topology. They ignore the difficult subproblems of routing and capacity assignment, a crucial determiner of network quality and cost. This article presents a total solution to mesh network design using a genetic algorithm approach. The application is a 10-city network that links Hong Kong and nine other cities in China. The development demonstrates that this method can be used for networks of reasonable size with realistic topology and traffic requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/607086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5686197","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"30","issue":"8","displayDocTitle":"Using genetic algorithms to design mesh networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using genetic algorithms to design mesh networks","sourcePdf":"00607086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050465S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"24","articleId":"607086","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":607088,"authors":[{"name":"D.X.

There are two main advantages of applying this method in HMM: feature dimension reduction is achieved simultaneously with the estimation of HMM parameters, therefore it guarantees that the likelihood function is monotonically increasing; and it requires very little extra computation in addition to the standard Baum-Welch algorithm, hence it can be easily incorporated in the existing speech recognition systems using HMMs.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607088","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

We represent the techniques and algorithms used to perform that model, the problems associated with representing the whole acoustic-phonetic structure, the characteristics of the model, and how it performs as a phonetic decoder for recognition of fluent Arabic speech. The model is trained, segmented (manually and automatically), and labeled using a fixed number of phonemes, each of which has a direct correspondence to the states of the model. The model assumes that the observed spectral vectors were generated by a Gaussian source. The inherent variability of each phoneme is modeled as the observable random process of the Markov chain, while the phonotactic model of the unobservable phonetic sequence is represented by the state transition matrix of the HMM. The model incorporated the variable duration feature densities in each state to account for the fact that vowel-like sounds have vastly different duration characteristics than consonant-like sounds. It is shown that the difficulties in developing an acoustic-phonetic model are not due to the inherent deficiencies of the concept presented. Instead they are due to the choice of the phonemes to be modeled, the selected parametrization of the data, and appropriate choice of the variant of the ergodic HMM. The model used for the recognition experiments is clearly not complete, but it adequately performs phonetic transcription of the unknown utterances, thereby serving as the initial step towards continuous speech recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

The preliminary results presented in this paper show that such an approach, even using quite simple recombination strategies, can yield at least comparable performance on clean speech while providing better robustness in the case of noisy speech.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607145","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

These likelihood calculations contribute significantly (30 to 70%) to the computational load. Previously, it has been reported that when GS is used on large systems the recognition accuracy tends to degrade above a /spl times/3 reduction in likelihood computation. To explain this degradation, this paper investigates the trade-offs necessary between achieving good state likelihoods and low computation. In addition, the problem of unseen states in a cluster is examined. It is shown that further improvements are possible. For example, using a different assignment measure, with a constraint on the number of components per state per cluster enabled the recognition accuracy on a 5k speaker-independent task to be maintained up to a /spl times/5 reduction in likelihood computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/607156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5683773","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"Use of Gaussian selection in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition using HMMS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Gaussian selection in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition using HMMS","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00607156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067233S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","isNumber":"13323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4822","citationCount":"18","articleId":"607156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":607162,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We develop a measure for the quality of variable-length models and present a pruning algorithm for the creation of such models, based on this measure. Further we address the question how the use of a special backing-off distribution can improve the language models. Experiments were performed on two data bases, the ARPANAB corpus and the German Verbmobil corpus, respectively. The results show that variable-length models outperform conventional models of the same size. Furthermore it can be seen that if a moderate loss in performance is acceptable, the size of a language model can be reduced drastically by using the presented pruning algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607162","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate two quantities P/sub ac/ and N, given the performance of the speech recognizer used in a dialog system. P/sub ac/ is the probability that information included in the user's utterance is conveyed to the system correctly, and N is the average number of turns taken between the user and the system until the subdialog on the user's first utterance terminates. The analysis has proven that the direct confirmation can increase P/sub ac/ and the indirect confirmation can reduce N in comparison with the basic strategy.

In order to achieve the envisaged coverage on the uncertain speech recognizer output, deep and shallow approaches to the analysis and transfer problem had to be combined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verbmobil: the combination of deep and shallow processing for spontaneous speech translation","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1997.607199","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4635/13187/00607199.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"74 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1997.607199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=607199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/607199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Verbmobil: the combination of deep and shallow processing for spontaneous speech translation","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5716075","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verbmobil: the combination of deep and shallow processing for spontaneous speech translation","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00607199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056702S","chronDate":"21-24 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4635","citationCount":"9","articleId":"607199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":607212,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The self adjusting decoding graph is obtained by slicing the traditional decoding network horizontally for separation of different knowledge sources and vertically according to each time instant in search.

In recent work cross-language HMM-based phoneme models have been used only for bootstrapping the language-dependent models and the multi-lingual approach has been investigated only on very small speech corpora. The author introduces a statistical distance measure to determine the similarities of sounds. Further, he presents a new technique to model multi-lingual phonemes. The experiments are conducted with the OGI Multi-Language Telephone Speech Corpus for the languages American English, German and Spanish. In the first experiment phoneme recognition rates between 39.0% and 53.9% are achieved using language-dependent models. Using cross-language models yields improvement for some phonemes, but on average a degradation of recognition performance is observed. However, cross-language models speeds up the cross-language transfer and reduce the size of the phoneme inventory of multi-lingual speech recognition systems. Finally, a new method of modelling multi-lingual phonemes, which can be used for a variety of languages, is presented. This technique reduces the number of phoneme-based units in a multi-lingual speech recognition system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607240","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

There is another class of recognizer which further processes these frames to produce a segment-based network, and represents each segment by fixed-dimensional \"features\". In such feature-based recognizers, the observation space takes the form of a temporal network of feature vectors, so that a single segmentation of an utterance uses a subset of all possible feature vectors. In this paper, we examine a maximum a-posteriori decoding strategy for feature-based recognizers and develop a normalization criterion that is useful for a segment-based Viterbi or A* search. We report experimental results for the task of phonetic recognition on the TIMIT corpus, where we achieved context-independent and context-dependent (using diphones) results on the core test set of 64.1% and 69.5% respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/607261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5684799","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"4","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic framework for feature-based speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic framework for feature-based speech recognition","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00607261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062946S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","isNumber":"13326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4822","citationCount":"37","articleId":"607261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":607274,"authors":[{"name":"T.

All of these phenomena have to be tackled when adapting a speech recognition system for spontaneous speech. We focus on how to automatically expand and adapt phonetic dictionaries for spontaneous speech recognition. Especially for spontaneous speech it is important to choose the pronunciations of a word according to the frequency in which they appear in the database rather than the \"correct\" pronunciation as might be found in a lexicon. Therefore, we proposed a data driven approach to add new pronunciations to a given phonetic dictionary (T. Slobada, 1995) in a way that they model the given occurrences of words in the database. We show how this algorithm can be extended to produce alternative pronunciations for word tuples and frequently misrecognized words. We also discuss how further knowledge can be incorporated into the phoneme recognizer in a way that it learns to generalize from pronunciations which were found previously. The experiments have been performed on the German Spontaneous Scheduling Task (GSST), using the speech recognition engine of JANUS 2, the spontaneous speech to speech translation system of the Interactive Systems Laboratories at Carnegie Mellon and Karlsruhe University (A.

One possible solution to this problem is to modify the probability density function (PDF) of clean speech to account for the effects of the degradation. However, even for the case of linear filtering and additive noise, it is extremely difficult to do this analytically. Previously attempted analytical solutions to the problem of noisy speech recognition have either used an overly simplified mathematical description of the effects of noise on the statistics of speech, or they have relied on the availability of large environment specific adaptation sets. Some of the previous methods required the use of adaptation data that consists of simultaneously recorded or \"stereo\" recordings of clean and degraded speech. We introduce an approximation based method to compute the effects of the environment on the parameters of the PDF of clean speech. We perform compensation by vector polynomial approximations (VPS) for the effects of linear filtering and additive noise on the clean speech. We also estimate the parameters of the environment, namely the noise and the channel, by using piecewise linear approximations of these effects. We evaluate the performance of this method (VPS) using the CMU SPHINX-II system and the 100 word alphanumeric CENSUS database. Performance is evaluated at several SNRs, with artificial white Gaussian noise added to the database. VPS provides improvements of up to 15 percent in relative recognition accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607277","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

The system is composed of a predictive neural network for every reference speaker, which is trained with the backpropagation algorithm and the maximum likelihood criterion, in order to obtain the highest probability that the input to the network belongs to the reference speaker. They also consider a global network trained on the whole training set whose likelihood gives a measure of the predictability of a given input with the aim of eliminating the strong dependence of the score from the particular input considered. The evaluation of the system is carried out on a subset of the Italian telephonic database SIVA, purposely collected for the considered task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/607298/","accessionNumber":"5684836","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predictive neural networks in text independent speaker verification: an evaluation on the SIVA database","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive neural networks in text independent speaker verification: an evaluation on the SIVA database","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00607298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031811S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","isNumber":"13326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4822","citationCount":"3","articleId":"607298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":607300,"authors":[{"name":"B.T.

Both discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and sampled continuous wavelet transforms (SCWT) are tested. The wavelet transform is used as a part of the front-end processor which extracts feature vectors for a speaker-independent HMM-based phoneme recognizer. The results are evaluated on a portion of the TIMIT corpus consisting of 30293 phoneme tokens for training and 14489 phoneme tokens for testing. The test results suggest that SCWT gives a considerably better recognition rate than DWT. On the other hand, the improvement of SCWT over Mel-scale cepstral coefficients appears to be marginal.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607300","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

Among consonants, the greatest influence has been found to occur on the syllabic nasal /N/ and the least on the voiceless stop /t/ in f-speech. For s-speech, /N/ has also been found to be the greatest but the least is voiced stop /d/. The ratio of duration between consonant and vowel of a CV-syllable in f-speech is kept almost the same as that in n-speech while vowel lengthening becomes significantly large in s-speech.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607301","startPage":"2435","endPage":"2438 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

The paper describes an alternative dialogue planning algorithm based on the notion of filling in an electronic form, or \"E-form\". Each slot has associated prompts that guide the user through the dialogue, and a priority that determines the order in which the system tries to acquire information. These slots can be optional or mandatory. However, the user is not restricted to follow the system's lead, and is free to ignore the prompts and take the initiative in the dialogue. The E-form based dialogue planner has been used in an application to search a database of used car advertisements. The goal is to assist the user in selecting, from this database, a small list of cars which match their constraints. For a large number of dialogues collected from over 600 naive users, we found over 70% compliance in answering specific system prompts.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607458","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

Condition monitoring systems have been developed to provide advanced warning of impending failure of components. By correctly predicting that a component is failing it can be replaced at an appropriate time thereby saving time and money for the operator of the system. These condition monitoring systems use various approaches and techniques to evaluate system parameters and make judgements on the condition of various components. This paper focuses on the two general approaches being investigated for condition monitoring systems: static pattern analysis approach and the dynamical systems approach. Both techniques are applied to real engine data and their performance results given.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970743","startPage":"295","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (Conf.

We describe a novel application of neural network technology to this domain and present results from three experiments which assess the performance gains obtained. These experiments directly compare the statistical techniques of logistic regression and discriminant analysis with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for performing rejection risk assessment. This paper documents an analysis of progressively more sophisticated modelling techniques, together with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. These experiments lead us to conclude that MLPs offer significant advantages over traditional statistical methods in this domain. Finally, the paper introduces a discussion, together with interim results, of the future directions being explored in this research program. In particular, this includes the use of temporal information to further enhance the performance of the most promising of the connectionist systems described in this paper.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970748","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (Conf.

The inherent complexity with the very large vocabulary is also reduced by the use of phrase boundary hypotheses conjectured via the phrase-final lengthening.

In speech recognition, the speech models provide a bank of statistical information that can be used in the channel identification and equalisation process. The authors consider HMM-based channel equalisation, and present results demonstrating that substantial improvement can be obtained through the equalisation process. An alternative method is to use a set of features which is more robust to channel distortion. Channel distortions result in an amplitude-tilt of the speech cepstrum, and so differential cepstral features should provide a measure of immunity to channel distortions. In particular the cepstral-time feature matrix, in addition to providing a framework for representing speech dynamics, can be made robust to channel distortions. They present results demonstrating that a major advantage of cepstral-time matrices is their channel insensitive character.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607741","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

Previous work demonstrated that a simple word-for-word channel model was sufficient to yield substantial increases in word accuracy. The paper demonstrates that some improvements in word accuracy result from augmenting the channel model with an account of word fertility in the channel. The work further demonstrates that a modem continuous speech recognizer can be used in \"black-box\" fashion for robustly recognizing speech for which the recognizer was not originally trained.

The method is based on modeling of the systematic speaker variation. The variation is modeled by a low-dimensional speaker space and the classification of speech segments is conditioned by the position in the speaker space. Because the effect of the speaker space position on the classification is determined in an off-line training procedure using the speakers in a training database, complex systematic speaker variation can be modeled. Speaker adaptation is achieved only by the constraint that the position in the speaker space is constant over each utterance. Therefore, no separate adaptation session is needed and the adaptation is present from the first utterance. Consequently, for a user there is no noticeable difference between this system and a speaker-independent system. The speaker model and the phonetic classification are implemented in the ANN part of a hybrid ANN/HMM system. In experiments with a pilot system, word accuracy is improved for utterances longer than three words, and utterance level results are improved for utterances of all lengths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/607769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5679366","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"Speaker adaptation by modeling the speaker variation in a continuous speech recognition system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker adaptation by modeling the speaker variation in a continuous speech recognition system","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00607769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029322S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","isNumber":"13324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4822","citationCount":"7","articleId":"607769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":607774,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is motivated by the fact that variability in SI acoustic models is attributed to both phonetic variation and variation among the speakers of the training population, that is independent of the information content of the speech signal. These two variation sources are decoupled and the proposed method jointly annihilates the inter-speaker variation and estimates the HMM parameters of the SI acoustic models. We compare the proposed training algorithm to the common SI training paradigm within the context of supervised adaptation. We show that the proposed acoustic models are more efficiently adapted to the test speakers, thus achieving significant overall word error rate reductions of 19% and 25% for 20K and 5K vocabulary tasks respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/607807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5679403","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A compact model for speaker-adaptive training","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact model for speaker-adaptive training","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00607807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031743S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","isNumber":"13324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4822","citationCount":"235","articleId":"607807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":607825,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The network trained by such a technique, however, does not behave in the desired way when it is embedded in the system that deals with non-Gaussian signals. As the least absolute estimation is known to be robust for noisy signals or a certain type of non-Gaussian signals, the network trained with this criterion might be less sensitive to the type of signal. The paper discusses the least absolute error criterion for error minimization in supervised neural networks. The authors pay particular attention to its efficiency for the linear prediction of speech. The computational loads of the conventional approaches to this estimation have been much heavier than the usual least squares estimator.

Therefore, recognition systems that model allophones using context-dependent hidden Markov models have been implemented (Lamel and Gauvain, 1993). HMMs have a great ability for segmentation in the temporal domain but have some difficulties in recognition because the MLE training (maximum likelihood estimation) is not discriminant, whereas discrimination is one of the abilities of artificial neural network models. In the last three years we have developed a new ANN model named OWE (Orthogonal Weight Estimator). The principle of the OWE is an ANN that classifies an input pattern according to the contextual environment. This new ANN architecture tackles the problem of context dependent behaviour training. Roughly, the principle is based on a main MLP (multilayered perceptron) in which each synaptic weight connection value is estimated by another MLP (an OWE) with respect to context representation. In this paper, we present a hierarchical system for phoneme recognition: first the system segments the input signal using 48 context independent HMMs. Then the stop consonants are reordered by an OWE ANN. Experiments on TIMIT show 78% correct recognition rate on the 6 stop consonants (/p, t, k, b, d, g).","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607853","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1312 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

An array of four omnidirectional microphones is placed at a distance of 1.5 m from the talker. Given the array signals, a time delay compensation (TDC) module provides a beam-formed signal that is shown to be effective as input to a hidden Markov model (HMM) based recognizer. Given a small number of sentences collected from a new speaker in a real environment, HMM adaptation further improves the recognition rate.

The TDMC consists of the averaged features and the dynamic features of the 2D mel-log spectra in the analyzed interval. The measure for speaker recognition is obtained by using a combination of the VQ distortion on the feature map and the prediction error on the predictive network.

We present an approach that uses the complete sets of right and left context dependent units as the basis phone sets. Training of these models is accomplished by a new training criterion that maximizes phone separation between competing models. The proposed phone selection and modeling approach was evaluated across different tasks in American English.

Although the intent when performing feature analysis is to extract \"relevant\" and \"discriminative\" information from the signal that is useful for speech recognition, this information may not be consistent with the objective of minimizing error rate in the recognition process. We utilize feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) to generate a new class of features for speech recognition. We propose a system for integrating the feature extraction process with the recognition process under a unified statistical framework with a consistent objective function that is designed to minimize recognition error rate. Results on a telephone based speaker independent connected digit task indicate that this integrated system with 12 ANNs is able to reduce the per digit error rate by a further 28% over a similar system using a single ANN and 16% over our previously best results in which feature transformation was not incorporated.","doi":"10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607985","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of Fourth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing.

It seems to be a general rule that variations in what we call the augmented prosodic domain (APD) are emotive-perhaps because they signal departure from a reference point corresponding to a well-controlled, neutral state. The studies show that various departures from that reference point are reflected in the APD, including central and sensory impairments (schizophrenia and deafness) as well as emotion. Intuitively it seems right to acknowledge that departures from well-controlled neutrality are highly confusable, and it is unclear that phonetics should to try draw those distinctions more sharply than listeners tend to. A system called ASSESS automatically measures properties in the APD, opening the way to explore it in an empirical spirit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1996","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5679618","displayDocTitle":"Automatic statistical analysis of the signal and prosodic signs of emotion in speech","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic statistical analysis of the signal and prosodic signs of emotion in speech","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00608027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025554S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1996","isNumber":"13325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4822","citationCount":"43","articleId":"608027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":608176,"authors":[{"name":"P.F.

The decision to adopt TWFL techniques was taken in the light of some 15 years unsatisfactory experience with equipment based on reactance methods.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19970061","startPage":"192","endPage":"196","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Developments in Power System Protection (Conf.

In response to this problem, we have developed an approach to building data tour guides, called FindMe systems. These programs know enough about an information space to help users navigate through it, making sure they not only come away with useful information but also insights into the structure of the information space itself. In these systems, we have combined the idea of instance-based browsing, which involves structuring retrieval around the critiquing of previously retrieved examples, and retrieval strategies, or knowledge-based heuristics for finding relevant information. This article illustrates these techniques with examples of working FindMe systems, and describes the similarities and differences between them.

The application of the ANN based fault measurement technique is then described. An Evolving Connectionist Network (ECN) with a GA is investigated to solve the problem of internal and external fault identification. The technique is based on utilising fault generated high frequency current signals to essentially recognise the various patterns generated within the frequency spectra of the signals, for the purposes of accurately distinguishing between internal and external faults under various system and fault conditions. In particular the effect on the higher frequency current signals (and therefore on the performance of the ANN-based protection technique) due, for example, to fault type, fault position and fault inception angle for nonlinear arcing faults is highlighted. The paper clearly demonstrates that the new ECN method can successfully optimise a connectionist network for fault identification in EHV transmission lines thereby significantly improving performance over backpropagation learning algorithm based NN.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970084","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Developments in Power System Protection (Conf.

As research matures to implementation stages, approaches to meter the actual power consumption in real-time are required. In this work, the authors model a real-time reactive power metering approach based on neural networks. A spot pricing model which incorporates the shortcomings of power factor penalties is used to determine the reactive power rates at each bus. A carefully designed artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to recognize the complex optimal operating point of an all-thermal electricity generating utility. A real time rate is allocated to each bus for a given power system's loading pattern and the recall process is instantaneous. The proposed approach is tested using a spot pricing model on 5 and 14 bus electric power systems. Different loading levels are used at each bus.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608252/","accessionNumber":"5752503","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An approach for metering real-time reactive power consumption using a neural network approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach for metering real-time reactive power consumption using a neural network approach","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"00608252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060908S","chronDate":"25-28 May 1997","isNumber":"13307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4813","articleId":"608252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":608256,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This spectrum spreading is usually performed using a pseudo-random (PN) sequence, but random coding analysis has indicated that bandwidth spreading using very low rate error correcting codes may lead to a larger system capacity over spreading based on PN sequence only. Hence a low rate convolutional code or combination of a low rate code and a spreading sequence could be used to improve the CDMA system capacity. We present an analysis of the CDMA capacity for the reverse, or uplink channel, from the mobile user to the base station. Using a constant overall bandwidth expansion, for a given target bit error probability we obtain the best sharing of the CDMA bandwidth between the error correcting code and the PN sequence. We can therefore evaluate the improvement in system capacity that can be obtained over more traditional CDMA systems where almost all the bandwidth expansion is due to the PN sequence spreading only.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the application of very low rate error control coding to CDMA","publicationTitle":"CCECE '97.

This provides a potential application to assess the patients heart condition in the home. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have several properties that make them promising for the automatic signal classification problems. In the time domain of the BCG classification, the whole cardiac cycle of BCG waveform needs a large size neural network and a large training sample which make the classification a computationally intensive task. By classifying the data in a compressed format, savings in computer time may be realised. In this paper, we used wavelet multiresolution analysis that allows significant information content of the BCG signal to be obtained. Small subsets of the wavelet coefficients were used to classify the normal hypertension and heart attack risk subjects by a single hidden layer neural network. It is shown that the proposed system achieved overall 94.66% correct classification rate for testing the data set. The advantage of the proposed classification system is to reduce the computation complexity and to be easily implemented into a standalone device for real time application.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1996.608390","pdfPath":"/iel3/4818/13319/00608390.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"495 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Digital Processing Applications (TENCON '96)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Digital Processing Applications (TENCON '96)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1996.608390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet multiresolution and neural network system for BCG signal analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet multiresolution and neural network system for BCG signal analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5679985","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"29-29 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet multiresolution and neural network system for BCG signal analysis","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00608390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032145S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","isNumber":"13319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4818","citationCount":"10","articleId":"608390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":608394,"authors":[{"name":"J.I.

A method being evaluated uses wavelets for speech analysis and synthesis. Distinguishing between voiced and unvoiced speech, determining pitch, and methods for choosing optimum wavelets for speech compression are discussed. We observe that wavelets concentrate speech energy into bands which differentiate between voiced or unvoiced speech. Optimum wavelets are selected based on energy conservation properties in the approximation part of the wavelet coefficients. It is shown that the Battle-Lemarie wavelet concentrates more than 97.5% of the signal energy into the approximation part of the coefficients followed closely by the Daubechies D20, D12, D10 or D8 wavelets. The Haar wavelets are the worst. Listening tests show that the Daubechies 10 preserves perceptual information better than other Daubechies wavelets and, indeed, a host of other orthogonal wavelets. Pitch periods and evolution can be identified from contour plots of coefficients obtained at several scales.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1996.608394","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Digital Processing Applications (TENCON '96)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Digital Processing Applications (TENCON '96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4818/13319/00608394.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1996.608394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13319","startPage":"514","endPage":"519 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform techniques in speech processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=608394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform techniques in speech processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608394/","conferenceDate":"29-29 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5679989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete wavelet transform techniques in speech processing","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00608394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068954S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","isNumber":"13319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4818","citationCount":"34","articleId":"608394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":608433,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The idea is to use wavelet transform to locate the transients produced from phase changes. The separation between transients gives a symbol rate estimate.

Unfortunately, the result is that the neural networks do not only detect the general peaks but also the local peaks and the extremely closed peaks. We train the neural networks to detect only the general peaks. The learning algorithm uses a steepest descent method such as the backpropagation (BP) algorithm.

Though there are several proposed techniques for solving the problem, none seems to produce a satisfactory practical result. Many limited factors are encountered such as the inconsistency of the scanning process, the incomplete and/or noisy original documents, and the shift and position variance of the recognition technique. We proposed to apply artificial neural networks (ANNs) together with some pre-processing and post-processing techniques to solve the Thai OCR problem. The experimental results confirm that ANNs are a very suitable technique for developing the Thai OCR software. The recognition rate on a real document of training fonts is about 90%-95%. This leads to a possible implementation in a production-quality OCR software that the NECTEC software technology laboratory is working on. The details of all processes are explained in the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608717/","accessionNumber":"5677940","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29-29 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Thai OCR: a neural network application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thai OCR: a neural network application","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00608717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031426S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","isNumber":"13332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4818","citationCount":"9","articleId":"608717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":608719,"authors":[{"name":"Leong Kwan Li","affiliation":["Applied mathematics department, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Leong Kwan Li","id":"37087159543"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3679-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"608719","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data compression","Function approximation","Neural networks","Image coding","Discrete transforms","Recurrent neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Mathematical analysis","Software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","recurrent neural nets","initial value problems","error analysis","approximation theory","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","recurrent neural network dynamics","dynamical systems","leaky-integrator model neural nets","arbitrary finite sequences","initial valued problem","error analysis","compression ratio","signal compression","approximation theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=608719","abstract":"Data compression is dominated by the Fourier or wavelet transforms which approximate the given function or sequence as a linear sum of the basis functions.

Although the former is more convenient for implementation reasons, the latter seems to be more efficient. When the quantization step tends to zero for a fixed sampling interval, the expected value of the quantization error decays exponentially as a function of the bit-rate B, E(e(t)/sup 2/)=O(exp(-2/spl alpha/B)). On the other hand, if the oversampling ratio is increased for a fixed quantization step the error behaves as E(e(t)/sup 2/)=O(1/B). We show that this inferior error-rate performance of oversampled A/D conversion is a consequence of inadequate reconstruction and encoding, and propose an efficient scheme for lossless encoding of quantized samples. With this encoding scheme the error of oversampled A/D conversion decays exponentially with the bit-rate.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608761","startPage":"437","endPage":"440 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13317/00608761.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On error-rate characteristics of oversampled A/D conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"On error-rate characteristics of oversampled A/D conversion","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5723866","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608761/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On error-rate characteristics of oversampled A/D conversion","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00608761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03166S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","articleId":"608761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":608763,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The first is an optoelectronic implementation and the other two are very large scale integration designs: a virtual implementation and a fully parallel implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Digital Processing Applications (TENCON '96)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4818/13332/00608775.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"172 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Digital Processing Applications (TENCON '96)","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1996.608775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1996.608775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=608775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified probabilistic neural network hardware implementation schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural network hardware","Signal processing","Very large scale integration","Nonlinear equations","Concurrent computing","Optical signal processing","CMOS technology","Parallel processing","Neural networks","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","VLSI","integrated optoelectronics","digital signal processing chips","optical neural nets","neural chips","time series","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic neural network","nonlinear time series analysis","Specht general regression neural network","optoelectronics","VLSI","RBF neural networks","clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Modified probabilistic neural network hardware implementation schemes","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5671368","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29-29 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified probabilistic neural network hardware implementation schemes","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00608775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04752S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","isNumber":"13332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4818","citationCount":"2","articleId":"608775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":608777,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As opposed to the previous work of Sagayama and Takahashi (see IEEE International Conf. on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Proc., vol.1, p.213-16, 1995), reducing the number of arithmetic operations is not the major concern when these computations are implemented in a standard CMOS process. Instead, the memory bandwidth is the limiting factor. We introduce a variant of the fix-point representation, called the dynamical circular fix-point format, which reduces the memory bandwidth requirements to one half of a traditional implementation and to the same as that of Sagayama et al. The memory requirements are reduced by a factor of 16 compared to Sagayama's method. The proposed solution has a simple hardware implementation and the speech recognizer performance degradation is insignificant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5671380","conferenceDate":"29-29 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI implementation of PDF computations in HMM based speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI implementation of PDF computations in HMM based speech recognition","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00608805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053654S","chronDate":"26-29 Nov 1996","isNumber":"13332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4818","citationCount":"14","articleId":"608805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":608806,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To alleviate this problem delta operator based analysis and design has been proposed for high speed digital signal processing and control systems. The advantage for delta (/spl delta/) operator seems to come from the fact as sampling period T/sub s//spl rarr/0, the discrete time system process resembles that of continuous time system. In this paper we develop a unified cellular neural network (CNN) cell model using the delta operator approach. The model gives a general discrete-time (DT) CNN cell dynamics in which the sampling period T/sub s/ is an explicit parameter. As T/sub s//spl rarr/0, we get the continuous time (CT)-CNN equation. Several results connected with the stability and robustness of CT-CNN and DT-CNN can be linked using this approach. This approach highlights the similarities, rather than the differences between discrete and continuous CNNs, thus allowing continuous insights to be applied to the discrete CNN case. Further, more importantly from the implementation point of view, delta operator based DT-CNN cell design can be obtained using /spl delta//sup -1/ as an integrator {instead of a delay (z/sup -1/)}. The /spl delta//sup -1/ integrator can be realized using switched current/switched capacitor circuits. The dynamic circuit element in the DT-CNN is thus \"/spl delta//sup -1/\".","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608822","startPage":"577","endPage":"580 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13317","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13317/00608822.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified cellular neural network cell dynamical equation using delta operator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608822/","displayDocTitle":"Unified cellular neural network cell dynamical equation using delta operator","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5716899","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified cellular neural network cell dynamical equation using delta operator","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00608822.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02827S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"3","articleId":"608822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":608823,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The outputs of these three modules are then combined by a combination neural network which is trained separately.

The induction motor is a complex nonlinear electromechanical system, with rapidly time-varying system parameters. Due to the small time constant of this power electronic system, the neural network must be able to finish each training cycle in less than 50 microseconds, which is only possible when controlled by specifically designed hardware circuits. An analog circuit is preferred for its ability to implement a reasonable size of network on one integrated chip. The analog circuit nonidealities are overcome by the Random Weight Change (RWC) algorithm. RWC is based on the method of random searching, and achieves similar performance to the back-propagation (BP) algorithm. The back-propagation algorithm is very difficult to implement in analog hardware due to its sensitivity to offset and nonlinearity errors. The RWC algorithm is simulated with analog circuit nonidealities, and is shown to be immune to these problems, thus the RWC algorithm is found ideally suited for the high speed analog circuit neural network implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608902","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13317/00608902.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"636 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High speed on-line neural network control of an induction motor immune to analog circuit nonidealities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"High speed on-line neural network control of an induction motor immune to analog circuit nonidealities","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5723877","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High speed on-line neural network control of an induction motor immune to analog circuit nonidealities","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00608902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033304S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"4","articleId":"608902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":608907,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Using three-state function as the activating function, multipliers are replaced by much simpler circuit. The back-propagation algorithm is modified to have no multiplier and the algorithm is implemented with pulse mode operation. This learning circuit is modified to improve the rate of successful learning. The derivative function of neurons which is used in the learning algorithm is changed for the higher learning rate. The modification is very simple, and the additional circuit for this modification is very small. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, the modified MNN is implemented on FPGAs and tested by experiment, and the detail of the learning performance is tested by computer simulations. These results show that the learning rate can be greatly improved by using the proposed MNN architecture. Also, the experimental result shows that the proposed MNN has a very fast operation of 17.9/spl times/10/sup 6/ connections per second (CPS) and 11.7/spl times/10/sup 6/ connection updates per second (CUPS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608907/","accessionNumber":"5723879","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improvement on the learning performance of multiplierless multilayer neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement on the learning performance of multiplierless multilayer neural network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00608907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071444S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"5","articleId":"608907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":608910,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In other words, the dynamics of all types of neural network can be analyzed and explained by using the fixed point theory in the traditional discrete dynamical system. What is equally important is that the explanation and classification of chaos can also be expressed in terms of its relationship with fixed points. This has provided an important link between chaos and neural network in the traditional discrete dynamical system, namely, the fixed point theory. Based on this idea, this paper proposes a method to combine chaos with neural network using the fixed point theory. With a view to practical application, the paper provides several examples on improving pattern recognition ability by adding chaotic noise in learning machines as well as on improving the ability of optimal solution in the large by creating a new Chaotic Hopfield Neural Network. The approach proposed by this paper is proved user friendly and universally applicable through lab experiments of pattern recognition and solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem on a set of 100 cities.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608910","startPage":"645","endPage":"648 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13317","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13317/00608910.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method to combine chaos and neural network based on the fixed point theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608910/","displayDocTitle":"A method to combine chaos and neural network based on the fixed point theory","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5723880","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method to combine chaos and neural network based on the fixed point theory","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00608910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040142S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"2","articleId":"608910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":608912,"authors":[{"name":"C.Z.

The approach followed is based on a Generalized Fock (GF) space framework developed by the Principal Investigator and T.A.W. Dwyer, III. A GF space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of discrete or continuous Volterra series with a problem-dependent weighted inner product. The optimal nonlinear filter structure is obtained by an orthogonal projection of the desired filter into the subspace spanned by the representers of interpolating, smoothing, and other design constraint functionals in the appropriate GF space. One of the attractive features of this approach is that the solutions to the filter design problem appear naturally as feedforward (FIR) or recurrent (IIR) artificial neural networks. These results are derived for a GF space F(E/sup N/) on a finite-dimensional Euclidian space E/sup N/. Generalization to functional FIR and IIR nonlinear filters follows immediately from replacing F(E/sup N/) by F(L/sub 2/(I)), where L/sub 2/(I) is the space of square integrable functions on an interval I of the real line.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608966","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13317/00608966.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"712 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.608966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal neural network realizations of nonlinear FIR and IIR filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimal neural network realizations of nonlinear FIR and IIR filters","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5723896","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal neural network realizations of nonlinear FIR and IIR filters","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00608966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022249S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"1","articleId":"608966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":608985,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

Face and image recognition is an important function in future smart, portable multimedia systems. However, it involves many complicated mathematical operations that requires extremely large computing power. Since most operations are in two-dimensional format, the cellular neural network paradigm can be extended for selective tasks in face recognition function. Compact neural network is a suitable computing architecture. It uses the state-constrained neuron model that prevents the state variables becoming unbounded. The clear advantage is that the network will converge to proper solutions quickly. In addition, the hardware annealing technique can be applied to the compact neural network architecture so that the optimized solution can be quickly obtained without the drawback of conventional simulated annealing searching complexity and time penalty.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/608985/","accessionNumber":"5723902","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional cellular neural networks for pre-processing in face recognition and digital library search","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional cellular neural networks for pre-processing in face recognition and digital library search","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00608985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032434S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","articleId":"608985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":609006,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Such a clock distribution system is to replace the existing electronic counterpart associated with high-speed supercomputers such as Cray T-90 machine. A waveguide propagation loss of 0.21 dB/cm at 850 nm was experimentally confirmed for the 1-to-48 waveguide fanout device. 1-to-2 splitting loss and bending loss were measured to be 0.25 dB and higher. The planarization requirement of the optical interconnection layer among many electrical interconnection layers makes the employment of tilted grating a choice of desire. Theoretical calculation predicts the 1-to-1 free-space to waveguide coupling with an efficiency as high as 95%. Currently, a coupling efficiency of 35% was experimentally confirmed due to the limited index difference between guiding and cladding layers. Further experiments aimed at structuring a larger guiding/cladding layer index differences are under investigation. To effectively couple an optical signal into the waveguide through the tilted grating coupler, the accuracy of the wavelength employed is pivotal. This makes the usage of the vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and VCSEL arrays the best choice when compared with edge-emitting lasers. Modulation bandwidth as high as 6 GHz was demonstrated at 850 nm. Such a wavelength is compatible with Si-based photodetectors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPPOI.1997.609060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13321","startPage":"10","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Massively Parallel Processing Using Optical Interconnections","pdfPath":"/iel3/4820/13321/00609060.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Si CMOS process compatible guided-wave multi-GBit/sec optical clock signal distribution system for Cray T-90 supercomputer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"Si CMOS process compatible guided-wave multi-GBit/sec optical clock signal distribution system for Cray T-90 supercomputer","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Si CMOS process compatible guided-wave multi-GBit/sec optical clock signal distribution system for Cray T-90 supercomputer","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00609060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092137S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1997","isNumber":"13321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4820","citationCount":"13","articleId":"609060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":609105,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

These approaches utilize either a polar format representation to compress magnitude and phase information of the complex SAR images, separately by different compression schemes, or use a Fourier transform scheme to convert the complex image data format to a real data format before applying the wavelet decomposition technique. In both concepts the phase information of the compressed images is preserved in great extent. Additionally, a concept based on vector quantization is used, taking advantage of the correlation between polarization channels for data compression in multi-polarization channel modes. Therefore, these approaches are suitable for data compression in both interferometric and polarimetric applications. Finally, the quality of the reconstructed images are compared in terms of compression ratio and proved by image quality parameters.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1997.609200","publicationTitle":"IGARSS'97. 1997 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium Proceedings.

These algorithms differ in many aspects, including quotient convergence rate, fundamental hardware primitives, and mathematical formulations. The paper presents a taxonomy of division algorithms which classifies the algorithms based upon their hardware implementations and impact on system design. Division algorithms can be divided into five classes: digit recurrence, functional iteration, very high radix, table look-up, and variable latency. Many practical division algorithms are hybrids of several of these classes. These algorithms are explained and compared. It is found that, for low-cost implementations where chip area must be minimized, digit recurrence algorithms are suitable. An implementation of division by functional iteration can provide the lowest latency for typical multiplier latencies. Variable latency algorithms show promise for simultaneously minimizing average latency while also minimizing area.","doi":"10.1109/12.609274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.609274","startPage":"833","endPage":"854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/13339/00609274.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Division algorithms and implementations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Division algorithms and implementations","volume":"46","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5693610","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Division algorithms and implementations","sourcePdf":"00609274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072815S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"187","articleId":"609274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":609275,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The fuzzy-based adaptive metering engine adjusts the number of points per cycle to be processed and the location of these points based on the optimal fuzzy rules constructed bp the genetic algorithm to satisfy overall metering error criteria under different operating environment while minimizing the number of points actually employed in the metering computation. This results in a reduction in the metering computation effort which frees up the processor for other tasks such as communication or power quality measurements. The fuzzy-based adaptive metering algorithm has been implemented on a microcontroller-based power metering system which operates under a multi-tasking operating system which exploits the efficiencies achieved by the reduced metering rite. The fuzzy-based adaptive metering algorithm has been tested with a variety of actual and synthesized power system waveforms and the experimental evaluations have demonstrated excellent accuracy in the metered power system quantities.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1997.609285","startPage":"218","endPage":"221 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference Sensing, Processing, Networking.

SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609310","startPage":"130","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609310","endPage":"136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training support vector machines: an application to face detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Training support vector machines: an application to face detection","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5637697","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training support vector machines: an application to face detection","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051413S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"1236","articleId":"609310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609311,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

A closed loop approach is proposed which utilizes structure from motion to generate a 3D model of a face and then feed back the estimated structure to constrain feature tracking in the next frame. The system initializes by using skin classification, symmetry operations, 3D warping and eigenfaces to find a face. Feature trajectories are then computed by SSD or correlation-based tracking. The trajectories are simultaneously processed by an extended Kalman filter to stably recover 3D structure, camera geometry and facial pose. Adaptively weighted estimation is used in this filter by modeling the noise characteristics of the 2D image patch tracking technique. In addition, the structural estimate is constrained by using parametrized models of facial structure (eigen-heads). The Kalman filter's estimate of the 3D state and motion of the face predicts the trajectory of the features which constrains the search space for the next frame in the video sequence. The feature tracking and Kalman filtering closed loop system operates at 25 Hz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametrized structure from motion for 3D adaptive feedback tracking of faces","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609312","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609312.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Parametrized structure from motion for 3D adaptive feedback tracking of faces","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644160","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametrized structure from motion for 3D adaptive feedback tracking of faces","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051107S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"108","articleId":"609312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":609319,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This problem poses several challenges. People are highly non-rigid objects with a high degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or on motion. The detection technique is based on the novel idea of the wavelet template that defines the shape of an object in terms of a subset of the wavelet coefficients of the image. It is invariant to changes in color and texture and can be used to robustly define a rich and complex class of objects such as people. We show how the invariant properties and computational efficiency of the wavelet template make it an effective tool for object detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609319/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5637700","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian detection using wavelet templates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian detection using wavelet templates","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054624S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"351","articleId":"609319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609321,"authors":[{"name":"D.

For these problems, one must deal with a data matrix with some missing elements. In structure-from-motion, missing elements will occur if some point features are not visible in some frames. To construct the intensity manifold missing matrix elements will arise when the surface normals of some scene points do not face the light source in some images. We propose a novel method for fitting a low rank matrix to a matrix with missing elements. We show experimentally that our method produces good results in the presence of noise.

The application background is vision-based driving assistance in the inner city. In an initial step, object parts are determined by a divisive clustering algorithm, which is applied to all pixels in the first image of the sequence. The feature space is defined by the color and position of a pixel. For each new image the clusters of the previous image are adapted iteratively by a parallel k-means clustering algorithm. Instead of tracking single points, edges, or areas over a sequence of images, only the centroids of the clusters are tracked. The proposed method remarkably simplifies the correspondence problem and also ensures a robust tracking behaviour.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609329","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609329.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking non-rigid, moving objects based on color cluster flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Tracking non-rigid, moving objects based on color cluster flow","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644170","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking non-rigid, moving objects based on color cluster flow","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084151S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"52","articleId":"609329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":609331,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Because of the importance of these results, it is our intent here to present a tutorial description of them.

The second is the general case (when the rotation around the optical axis and zooming are arbitrary). Some efficient methods have been developed to solve the first case. But the second case is more difficult, in particular, when the rotation around the optical axis is very large (90 degrees or more). Often in this case human interaction is needed to provide a first approximation of the transformation that will bring one back to the first case.

In all the traditional techniques to compute these transformations, especially the ones relying on direct intensity gradients, one image and its coordinate system have been assumed to be ideal and distortion free. In this paper, we present a formulation and an algorithm for true multi-image alignment that does not rely on the measurements of a reference image being distortion free. For instance, in the presence of lens distortion, none of the images can be assumed to be ideal. In our formulation, all the images are modeled as intensity measurements represented in their respective coordinate systems, each of which is related to an ideal coordinate system through an interior camera transformation and an exterior view transformation. The goal of the accompanying algorithm is to compute an image in the ideal coordinate system while solving for the transformations that relate the ideal system with each of the data images. Key advantages of the technique presented in this paper are: (i) no reliance on one distortion free image, (ii) ability to register images and compute coordinate transformations even when the multiple images are of an extended scene with no overlap between the first and last frame of the sequence, and (iii) ability to handle linear and non-linear transformations within the same framework. The new algorithm is evaluated in the context of two applications: (i) correction of lens distortion, and (ii) creation of video mosaics.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609364","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","startPage":"450","endPage":"456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"True multi-image alignment and its application to mosaicing and lens distortion correction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"True multi-image alignment and its application to mosaicing and lens distortion correction","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609364/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5637706","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"True multi-image alignment and its application to mosaicing and lens distortion correction","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029301S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"36","articleId":"609364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":609369,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

A new camera with a hemispherical field of view is presented. Two such cameras can be placed back-to-back, without violating the single viewpoint constraint, to arrive at a truly omnidirectional sensor. Results are presented on the software generation of pure perspective images from an omnidirectional image, given any user-selected viewing direction and magnification.

Traffic engineers, however, are more interested in monitoring freeways when there is congestion, and current systems break down for congested traffic due to the problem of partial occlusion. We are developing a feature-based tracking approach for the task of tracking vehicles under congestion. Instead of tracking entire vehicles, vehicle sub-features are tracked to make the system robust to partial occlusion. In order to group together sub-features that come from the same vehicle, the constraint of common motion is used. In this paper we describe the system, a real-time implementation using a network of DSP chips, and experiments of the system on approximately 44 lane hours of video data.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609371","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609371.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time computer vision system for measuring traffic parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609371/","displayDocTitle":"A real-time computer vision system for measuring traffic parameters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644203","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time computer vision system for measuring traffic parameters","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041332S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"245","articleId":"609371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609372,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-T.

Recently a number of algorithms have been developed that successfully perform motion segmentation by assuming that the motion of each group can be described by a low dimensional parametric model (e.g. affine). Typically the assumption is that motion segments correspond to planar patches in 3D undergoing rigid motion. Here we develop an alternative approach, where the motion of each group is described by a smooth dense flow field and the stability of the estimation is ensured by means of a prior distribution on the class of flow fields. We present a variant of the EM algorithm that can segment image sequences by fitting multiple smooth flow fields to the spatiotemporal data. Using the method of Green's functions, we show how the estimation of a single smooth flow field can be performed in closed form, thus making the multiple model estimation computationally feasible. Furthermore, the number of models is estimated automatically using similar methods to those used in the parametric approach. We illustrate the algorithm's performance on synthetic and real image sequences.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","startPage":"520","endPage":"526","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609375.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smoothness in layers: Motion segmentation using nonparametric mixture estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Smoothness in layers: Motion segmentation using nonparametric mixture estimation","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644207","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smoothness in layers: Motion segmentation using nonparametric mixture estimation","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030567S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"114","articleId":"609375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":609380,"authors":[{"name":"W.T.

We may want to disentangle illuminant and object colors in color constancy; rendering conditions from surface shape in shape-from-shading; face identity and head pose in face recognition; or font and letter class in character recognition. We refer to these two factors generically as \"style\" and \"content\". Bilinear models offer a powerful framework for extracting the two-factor structure of a set of observations, and are familiar in computational vision from several well-known lines of research. This paper shows how bilinear models can be used to learn the style-content structure of a pattern analysis or synthesis problem, which can then be generalized to solve related tasks using different styles and/or content. We focus on three tasks: extrapolating the style of data to unseen content classes, classifying data with known content under a novel style, and translating data from novel content classes and style to a known style or content. We show examples from color constancy, face pose estimation, shape-from-shading, typography and speech.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning bilinear models for two-factor problems in vision","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609380","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609380.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Learning bilinear models for two-factor problems in vision","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644212","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning bilinear models for two-factor problems in vision","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039221S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"47","articleId":"609380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609382,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Low-level primitives are areas of coherent motion found by EM clustering, mid-level categories are simple movements represented by dynamical systems, and high-level complex gestures are represented by Hidden Markov Models as successive phases of ample movements.

The motion constancy of these is used to rectify an initial projective reconstruction. Euclidean scene structure is formulated in terms of the absolute quadric-the singular dual 3D quadric (4/spl times/4 rank 3 matrix) giving the Euclidean dot-product between plane normals. This is equivalent to the traditional absolute conic but simpler to use. It encodes both affine and Euclidean structure, and projects very simply to the dual absolute image conic which encodes camera calibration. Requiring the projection to be constant gives a bilinear constraint between the absolute quadric and image conic, from which both can be recovered nonlinearly from m/spl ges/3 images, or quasi-linearly from m/spl ges/4. Calibration and Euclidean structure follow easily. The nonlinear method is stabler, faster, more accurate and more general than the quasi-linear one. It is based on a general constrained optimization technique-sequential quadratic programming-that may well be useful in other vision problems.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609388","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609388.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autocalibration and the absolute quadric","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autocalibration and the absolute quadric","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644220","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autocalibration and the absolute quadric","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029442S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"226","articleId":"609388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":609400,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

The accumulation of these parameters for many points on the surface of the object results in an image at each oriented point. These images, localized descriptions of the global shape of the object, are invariant to rigid transformations. Through correlation of images, point correspondences between a model and scene data are established and then grouped using geometric consistency.

Some quantities of interest in computer vision are defined on curved manifolds; typical examples are orientation and hue that are defined on the circle. Generalizing diffusions to orientation is not straightforward, especially in the case where a discrete implementation is sought. An example of what may go wrong is presented. A method is proposed to define diffusions of orientation-like quantities. First a definition in the continuum is discussed, then a discrete orientation diffusion is proposed. The behavior of such diffusions is explored both analytically and experimentally. It is shown how such orientation diffusions contain a nonlinearity that is reminiscent of edge-process and anisotropic diffusion. A number of open questions are proposed at the end.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609404","startPage":"710","endPage":"716","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609404.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orientation diffusions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gabor filters","Brightness","Filtering","Low pass filters","Smoothing methods","Image analysis","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Noise figure","Frequency","Event detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","brightness","image representation","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orientation diffusions","noisy brightness images","image smoothing","image analysis","multiple scales","computer vision","curved manifolds","hue","circle","discrete orientation diffusion","edge-process","anisotropic diffusion","image representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Orientation diffusions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5644236","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orientation diffusions","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029684S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"3","articleId":"609404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":609407,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbo Shi","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jianbo Shi","id":"37275094100"},{"name":"J.

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609407","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609407.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalized cuts and image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Normalized cuts and image segmentation","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5644239","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized cuts and image segmentation","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031661S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"228","articleId":"609407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609409,"authors":[{"name":"W.Y.

We demonstrate our technique in the context of face detection with complex background without color or motion information, which has proven to be a challenging problem. We use a family of discrete Markov processes to model the face and background patterns and estimate the probability models using the data statistics. Then, we convert the learning process into an optimization, selecting the Markov process that optimizes the information-based discrimination between the two classes. The detection process is carried out by computing the likelihood ratio using the probability model obtained from the learning procedure. We show that because of the discrete nature of these models, the detection process is at least two orders of magnitude less computationally expensive than neural network approaches.

In this paper, we show that an additional labeling of shocks based on whether the colliding wavefronts carry true orientation information (regular vs. rarefaction waves) allows a division of shocks into three sets: regular shocks are the partial shocks of partial contours as they remain invariant to the completion of the contour; semi-degenerate and degenerate shocks depict potential parts and gaps. Finally, shocks altered due to spurious edges, occlusion, and gaps are recovered via a simulation of inter-penetrating waves generated at select shock groups which with the aid of the above shock labels leads to second and further generations of shocks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609425.pdf","endPage":"845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shocks from images: propagation of orientation elements","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609425","startPage":"839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Shocks from images: propagation of orientation elements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609425/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5644256","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shocks from images: propagation of orientation elements","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030845S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"12","articleId":"609425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":609428,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The algorithm is based on a \"disturbance map\", which is obtained by linearly subtracting the temporal average of the previous frames from the new frame. Every local motion creates a disturbance having the form of a wave, with a \"head\" at the present position of the motion and a historical \"tail\" that indicates the previous locations of that motion. These disturbances serve as loci of attraction for \"tracking particles\" that are scattered throughout the image. The algorithm is very fast and can be performed in real time. We provide excellent tracking results on various complex sequences, using both stabilized and moving cameras, showing: a busy ant column, waterfalls, rapids and, flowing streams, shoppers in a mall, and cars in a traffic intersection.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609434.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"902","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion of disturbances: detection and tracking of multi-body non-rigid motion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion detection","Tracking","Shape","Object recognition","Computer science","Particle scattering","Computer vision","Data mining","Feature extraction","Object segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion of disturbances","multibody nonrigid motion tracking","disturbance map","temporal average","busy ant column","waterfalls","rapids","flowing streams","shoppers","traffic intersection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Motion of disturbances: detection and tracking of multi-body non-rigid motion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644265","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion of disturbances: detection and tracking of multi-body non-rigid motion","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033406S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"19","articleId":"609434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":609439,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The basis of the representation is a temporal template-a static vector-image where the vector value at each point is a function of the motion properties at the corresponding spatial location in an image sequence. Using 18 aerobics exercises as a test domain, we explore the representational power of a simple, two component version of the templates: the first value is a binary value indicating the presence of motion, and the second value is a function of the recency of motion in a sequence. We then develop a recognition method which matches these temporal templates against stored instances of views of known actions. The method automatically performs temporal segmentation, is invariant to linear changes in speed, and runs in real-time on a standard platform. We recently incorporated this technique into the KIDSROOM: an interactive, narrative play-space for children.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Image sequences","Image reconstruction","Pattern recognition","Pixel","Laboratories","Testing","Image segmentation","Computer vision","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","motion estimation","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human movement representation","human movement recognition","temporal templates","view-based approach","static vector-image","motion properties","spatial location","image sequence","stored instances","temporal segmentation","KIDSROOM"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609439.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609439","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The representation and recognition of human movement using temporal templates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609439/","displayDocTitle":"The representation and recognition of human movement using temporal templates","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644270","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The representation and recognition of human movement using temporal templates","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031256S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"261","articleId":"609439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609450,"authors":[{"name":"M.

HMMs are perhaps the most successful framework in perceptual computing for modeling and classifying dynamic behaviors, popular because they offer dynamic time warping, a training algorithm and a clear Bayesian semantics. However the Markovian framework makes strong restrictive assumptions about the system generating the signal-that it is a single process having a small number of states and an extremely limited state memory. The single-process model is often inappropriate for vision (and speech) applications, resulting in low ceilings on model performance. Coupled HMMs provide an efficient way to resolve many of these problems, and offer superior training speeds, model likelihoods, and robustness to initial conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609450.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"999","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled hidden Markov models for complex action recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech","Bayesian methods","Computer vision","Signal generators","Signal processing","Application software","Signal resolution","Robustness","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","computer vision","Bayes methods","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled hidden Markov models","complex action recognition","vision task","two-handed actions","dynamic behaviors","dynamic time warping","training algorithm","Bayesian semantics","limited state memory","single-process model","training speeds","model likelihoods","robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Coupled hidden Markov models for complex action recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644280","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled hidden Markov models for complex action recognition","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022319S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"474","articleId":"609450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":609451,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

When model databases are large, the use of high-dimensional features is critical, due to the improved level of discrimination they can provide. Unfortunately, finding the nearest neighbour to a query point rapidly becomes inefficient as the dimensionality of the feature space increases. Past indexing methods have used hash tables for hypothesis recovery, but only in low-dimensional situations. In this paper we show that a new variant of the k-d tree search algorithm makes indexing in higher-dimensional spaces practical. This Best Bin First, or BBF search is an approximate algorithm which finds the nearest neighbour for a large fraction of the queries, and a very close neighbour in the remaining cases. The technique has been integrated into a fully developed recognition system, which is able to detect complex objects in real, cluttered scenes in just a few seconds.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1997.609451","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4821/13322/00609451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1997.609451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13322","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape indexing using approximate nearest-neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shape indexing using approximate nearest-neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609451/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644281","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape indexing using approximate nearest-neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00609451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04401S","chronDate":"17-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4821","citationCount":"398","articleId":"609451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":609462,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The method avoids image correspondence problems by working in a discretized scene space whose voxels are traversed in a fixed visibility ordering. This strategy takes full account of occlusions and allows the input cameras to be far apart and widely distributed about the environment. The algorithm identifies a special set of invariant voxels which together form a spatial and photometric reconstruction of the scene, fully consistent with the input images.

Various methods for camera calibration can be found from the literature. However surprisingly little attention has been paid to the whole calibration procedure, i.e., control point extraction from images, model fitting, image correction, and errors originating in these stages. The main interest has been in model fitting, although the other stages are also important. In this paper we present a four-step calibration procedure that is an extension to the two-step method. There is an additional step to compensate for distortion caused by circular features, and a step for correcting the distorted image coordinates. The image correction is performed with an empirical inverse model that accurately compensates for radial and tangential distortions.

As a circuit is tested, the output signals from a Unit Under Test can vary as different functions are invoked by the test. When plotted against time, these signals create a characteristic trace for the test performed. Sensors in the ATS can be used to monitor the output signals during test execution. Using such an approach, defective components can be classified using a Neural Network according to the pattern of variation from that exhibited by a known good card. This provides a means to develop testing strategies for circuits based upon observed performance rather than domain expertise. Such capability is particularly important with systems whose performance, especially under faulty conditions, is not well documented or where suitable domain knowledge and experience does not exist. Thus, neural network solutions may, in some application areas, exhibit better performance.","doi":"10.1109/62.609531","startPage":"36","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/62.609531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/62/13358/00609531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using neural networks to solve testing problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609531/","displayDocTitle":"Using neural networks to solve testing problems","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5675676","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using neural networks to solve testing problems","sourcePdf":"00609531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030946S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"3","articleId":"609531","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":609544,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Hsueh Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Pai-Hsueh Yang","id":"37087650019"},{"name":"D.M.

Integral learning is the simplest algorithm and anti-windup is often indispensable in helping the controller to recover from the dilemma of saturation and to improve the transient performance. Neural network learning control, with the advantage of identifying system inverse dynamics, can quickly reduce output error in the first few iterations; however, the error converges very slowly thereafter. A unified hybrid controller employing a neural network and integral learning is proposed to pursue fast convergence of tracking error and good transient performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609544/","accessionNumber":"6034359","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to iterative learning control using neural network and integral control with anti-windup","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to iterative learning control using neural network and integral control with anti-windup","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00609544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031388S","chronDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4827","articleId":"609544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":609547,"authors":[{"name":"X.

This paper explores their use in robustness analysis with real parameter variations, a known NP hard problem which would appear to be ideally suited to demonstrate the power of GAs and SA. Numerical experiment results show convincingly that they turn out to be poorer than existing branch and bound (B&B) approaches. While this may appear to shed doubt on some of the hype surrounding these stochastic optimization techniques, we find that they do have attractive features, which are also demonstrated in this study. For example, both GAs and SA are almost trivial to understand and program, so they require essentially no expertise, in sharp contrast to the B&B methods. They may be suitable for problems where programming effort is much more important than running time or the quality of the answer. Robustness analysis for engineering problems is not the best candidate in this respect, but it does provide an interesting test case for the evaluation of GAs and SA. A simple hill climbing algorithm is also studied for comparison.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1997.609547","startPage":"3756","endPage":"3760 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 American Control Conference (Cat.

In this paper we consider the problem of restarting or resuming playback following an interactive operation such as fast forward, rewind, or indexed jump in stored on-demand video. We present two approaches to restart playback after an interactive operation, and develop algorithms to compute the latencies incurred in restarting playback. Using long MPEG-1 traces, with an optimal smoothing technique to transmit data for regular playback, we demonstrate that the latencies incurred under our approaches are very small. We next examine the latencies incurred when restarting playback in a video server under two policies for sharing its bandwidth: (a) one in which only regular playback bandwidth is available to restart playback and (b) one in which additional free server bandwidth (if any) is accessible. We find playback restart latencies to be similarly low under both policies, suggesting that the simpler approach (a) is sufficient.","doi":"10.1109/MMCS.1997.609757","startPage":"458","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMCS.1997.609757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13368","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4835/13368/00609757.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Playback restart in interactive streaming video applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609757/","displayDocTitle":"Playback restart in interactive streaming video applications","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5644109","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Playback restart in interactive streaming video applications","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00609757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055152S","chronDate":"3-6 June 1997","isNumber":"13368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4835","citationCount":"13","articleId":"609757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":609810,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

It draws heavily on other fields, often using interdisciplinary teams of mathematicians and computer scientists working with scientists and engineers to solve problems requiring multiple areas of expertise. In this paper four examples of computational science in action illustrate the relation between CSE and the distinct but complementary disciplines it draws upon, focusing in particular on mathematics. Each example illustrates the need for interdisciplinary work. The training necessary for success in computational science, not surprisingly, is somewhat different from that traditionally prescribed by single academic disciplines. The use of the term applied mathematics is a little arbitrary. Some, applied mathematicians working in areas such as fluid dynamics are unconnected with applications, while the work of some core mathematicians in areas such as string theory and number theory makes fundamental contributions in applied areas such as mathematical physics and cryptography. We take applied mathematics to be that part of mathematics used in science and engineering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609827/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr-Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr-Jun 1997","publicationDate":"April-June 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5645263","volume":"4","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Teamwork: computational science and applied mathematics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teamwork: computational science and applied mathematics","sourcePdf":"00609827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052378S","chronDate":"Apr-Jun 1997","isNumber":"13315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"99","citationCount":"5","articleId":"609827","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609829,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This results in a physically-based framework for motion and strain analysis. The results from the skin elasticity experiments show promise of detecting differences in elasticity between normal and abnormal tissue.

The ratio of the size of transistors between two consecutive stages is the buffer taper factor. With higher frequency of operation and simultaneous switching of the output drivers, the parasitic inductance present at the pin-pad-package interface results in significant switching noise on the power lines. A comprehensive analysis and estimate of simultaneous switching noise (SSN) including the velocity saturation effects seen in the submicron transistors during the switching of output drivers is presented. The effect of SSN on the overall buffer propagation delay and transition time is discussed. The presence of SSN results in an increase in the optimum taper factor between inverter stages for a given capacitive load. Beyond a critical value, the output transition time of a tapered buffer increases with reducing taper factor due to SSN. SSN can be reduced by skewing the switching of output buffers, SPICE simulation results show that skewing buffer switching with additional inverter stages reduces SSN and increases buffer propagation delay.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/13309/00609872.pdf","doi":"10.1109/92.609872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.609872","startPage":"290","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of simultaneous switching noise on the tapered buffer design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609872/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of simultaneous switching noise on the tapered buffer design","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5689553","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of simultaneous switching noise on the tapered buffer design","sourcePdf":"00609872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057501S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"31","articleId":"609872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609873,"authors":[{"name":"Hiok-Tiaq Ng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Hiok-Tiaq Ng","id":"37367274600"},{"name":"D.J.

Although there Is currently no dominant approach or technique among the various neural networks and learning algorithms, the basic functionality of most neural networks can be conceptually realized as a multidimensional look-up table. While multidimensional look-up tables are clearly impractical due to the exponential memory requirements, we are pursuing an approach using interpolation based only on the sparse data provided by an initial example database. In particular, we have designed prototype VLSI components for searching multidimensional example databases for the X closest examples to an input query as determined by a programmable metric using a massively parallel search. This nearest-neighbor approach can be used directly for classification, or in conjunction with any number of neural network algorithms that exploit local fitting. The hardware removes the I/O bottleneck from the learning task by supplying a reduced set of examples for localized training or classification. Though nearest-neighbor retrieval algorithms have efficient software implementations for low-dimensional databases, exhaustive searching is the only effective approach for handling high-dimensional data. The parallel VLSI hardware we have designed can accelerate the exhaustive search by three orders of magnitude. We believe this special purpose VLSI will have direct application in systems requiring learning functionality and in accelerating learning applications on large, high-dimensional databases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Hardware","Databases","Neural networks","Multidimensional systems","Acceleration","Performance evaluation","Computer networks","Table lookup","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","VLSI","learning by example","real-time systems","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-based learning","neural networks","repeated network evaluations","learning algorithms","VLSI components","multidimensional example databases","input query","massively parallel search","nearest-neighbor approach","local fitting","localized training","nearest-neighbor retrieval algorithms","exhaustive searching","learning functionality","high-dimensional databases"]}],"doi":"10.1109/92.609875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/13309/00609875.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.609875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI hardware for example-based learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VLSI hardware for example-based learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609875/","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5689556","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI hardware for example-based learning","sourcePdf":"00609875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03246S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","articleId":"609875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":609876,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The channel estimates are used to perform maximum ratio combining. Bit error rate is evaluated analytically as a function of fading statistics and receiver tracking parameters. Results demonstrate performance sensitivity to the choice of the LMS step size when the channel is modeled as a second-order AR process. Performance degradation increases with fading rate, leading to the saturation of the error probability at a level determined by the fading rate of the channel and the deviation of the step size from the optimal value.

Within this environment, the resource management algorithms must take into account the QoS desired by applications and the ability of the system resources to provide it. We present a taxonomy for specifying QoS for the different components of a distributed system, from the applications down to the resources. We specify QoS as a combination of metrics and policies. QoS metrics are used to specify performance parameters, security requirements and the relative importance of the work in the system. We define three types of QoS performance parameters: timeliness, precision, and accuracy. QoS policies capture application-specific policies that govern how an application is treated by the resource manager. Examples of such policies are management policies and the levels of service. We explore each of these components of the QoS taxonomy in detail.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13357","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Workshop on Object-Oriented Real-Time Dependable Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Workshop on Object-Oriented Real-Time Dependable Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4830/13357/00609931.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WORDS.1997.609931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WORDS.1997.609931","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Taxonomy for QoS specifications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Feb 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609931/","displayDocTitle":"Taxonomy for QoS specifications","conferenceDate":"5 June-7 Feb. 1997","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5685300","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Taxonomy for QoS specifications","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00609931.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050435S","chronDate":"5-7 Feb 1997","isNumber":"13357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4830","citationCount":"79","articleId":"609931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609935,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Do they really bring forth such performance boost in a realistic scenario? The aim of this study is to give a preliminary answer to such a question, through the capacity analysis of the forward link of a multi-satellite, multi-beam, radio communication network at S-band. Specifically, starting from simplified yet realistic assumptions on the beam layout, the antenna footprint shape, and the coding/multiplexing/modulation strategies, it is shown that the blind, adaptive, interference-mitigation receiver, selected as representative of the lot, can indeed boost the system quality of service in terms of outage probability. The results are derived after a mix of theoretical analysis (as far as the detector performance evaluation is concerned) and simulation (to examine a number of different random system configurations) to circumvent the inherent complexity of the issue.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.609935","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00609935.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"678 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.609935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of a multi-beam, multi-satellite CDMA mobile radio networks with interference-mitigating receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609935/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of a multi-beam, multi-satellite CDMA mobile radio networks with interference-mitigating receivers","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5786348","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of a multi-beam, multi-satellite CDMA mobile radio networks with interference-mitigating receivers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00609935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083678S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"2","articleId":"609935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":609937,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The underlying TDMA frame structure allows for the transmission of variable bit rate (VBR) information, while the CDMA provides inherent statistical multiplexing. The system is studied for a multimedia satellite environment with long-range dependent data traffic, and VBR real-time voice and video traffic. Simulation results show that with MC-TDMA, the data packet delay and the probability of real-time packet loss can be maintained low. The above advantages are achieved at the expense of soft blocking, which occurs when many packets are transmitted simultaneously, but on different spreading codes. Similar conclusions are drawn for simulations where the channel propagation conditions, adjacent beam interference, and imperfect power control are considered.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.609937","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00609937.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"688 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.609937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-code TDMA (MC-TDMA) for multimedia satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=609937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/609937/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-code TDMA (MC-TDMA) for multimedia satellite communications","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5786350","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-code TDMA (MC-TDMA) for multimedia satellite communications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00609937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040929S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","articleId":"609937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":609945,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.
