We generated test sets which executed all branches in a variety of programs including a quadratic equation solver, remainder, linear and binary search procedures, and a triangle classifier comprising a system of five procedures. We regard the generation of test sets as a search through the input domain for appropriate inputs. The genetic algorithms generated test data to give 100% branch coverage in up to two orders of magnitude fewer tests than random testing. Whilst some of this benefit is offset by increased computation effort, the adequacy of the test data is improved by the genetic algorithm's ability to generate test sets which are at or close to the input subdomain boundaries. Genetic algorithms may be used for fault-based testing where faults associated with mistakes in branch predicates are revealed. The software has been deliberately seeded with faults in the branch predicates (i.e. mutation testing), and our system successfully killed 97% of the mutants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8151511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Strategy for using Genetic Algorithms to Automate Branch and Fault-based Testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Strategy for using Genetic Algorithms to Automate Branch and Fault-based Testing","sourcePdf":"410098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0299S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"8151507","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"18","articleId":"8151511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-08-11"},{"_id":8151800,"authors":[{"name":"Ute Kaiser","firstName":"Ute","lastName":"Kaiser"},{"name":"Koh Saitoh","firstName":"Koh","lastName":"Saitoh"},{"name":"kenji Tsuda","firstName":"kenji","lastName":"Tsuda"},{"name":"Michiyoshi Tanaka","firstName":"Michiyoshi","lastName":"Tanaka"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0022-0744"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1477-9986"}],"articleNumber":"8151800","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8151800","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convergent beam electron diffraction","lattice parameter","cubic SiC"]}],"doi":"10.1093/oxfordjournals.jmicro.a023672","publicationTitle":"Microscopy","displayPublicationTitle":"Microscopy","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016812/8151795/08151800.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jmicro.a023672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8151795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the CBED method for the determination of lattice parameters of cubic Sic films on 6H SiC substrates","abstract":"Many-beam Bloch wave CBED pattern simulation is used to determine the lattice parameter of thin cubic SiC films on 6H SiC substrates from experimental on-axis CBED patterns at zones showing lattice parameter change sensitive HOLZ line shifts.

The agreement of three ratios between defined HOLZ lines in each zone axis pattern ensures a lattice parameter determination with high accuracy. For two SiC layers the lattice parameters are determined with an accuracy of 0.0001 nm to be 0.4374 nm and 0.4369 nm.

The microstructure and crystal structure of GST were identified with high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and image simulation technique, and the Ti diffusion into GST was revealed by scanning transmission electron microscope-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. It was observed that Ti atoms of Ti/TiN thin layers were incorporated into GST cell through several thermal annealing steps and they could retard the phase transition from face-centered cubic (FCC) phase into hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase partially and restrain the increase in grain size. Thus, it is concluded that Ti diffusion can affect the microstructure of GST including the type of the crystal phase and grain size of GST. It was shown that the insertion of diffusion barrier between TiN and GST could block Ti diffusion into GST and make it possible for FCC phase to completely transform into HCP phase.","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PRAM","Ge2Sb2Te5","microstructure","FCC","HCP","Ti diffusion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8153162","doi":"10.1093/jmicro/dfv039","startPage":"381","endPage":"386","publicationTitle":"Microscopy","displayPublicationTitle":"Microscopy","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016812/8153161/08153162.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8153161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jmicro/dfv039","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8153162/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Ti diffusion on the microstructure of Ge<inf>2</inf>Sb<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>5</inf> in phase-change memory cell","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"64","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Ti diffusion on the microstructure of Ge<inf>2</inf>Sb<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>5</inf> in phase-change memory cell","sourcePdf":"dfv039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023678S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","isNumber":"8153161","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016812","articleId":"8153162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8155443,"authors":[{"name":"Mikko Kivel\u00e4","firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Kivel\u00e4"},{"name":"Alex Arenas","firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Arenas"},{"name":"Marc Barthelemy","firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Barthelemy"},{"name":"James P.

Consequently, it is necessary to generalize \u2018traditional\u2019 network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks.

Intrinsic neural firing and response properties vary with changing levels of potent neuromodulators that are released throughout the brain by subcortical areas. Synaptic structure can vary by two distinct mechanisms: (1) the number of physical synaptic elements can change as a result of activity or pathology, and (2) the efficacy of synaptic signals can change by multiple mechanisms of long-term and short-term plasticity. In this study, we use biophysical models of neuronal networks to investigate the effects of heterogeneity in cellular and synaptic structural properties on network synchronization. We consider excitatory networks consisting of neurons with heterogeneous intrinsic properties, due to non-uniform neuromodulation by acetylcholine. By simulating synaptic loss, our results show that characteristics of synchronous network bursts depend on the connectivity density between different cell types in the network. We further show that synaptic loss affects plastic synaptic remodelling of the remaining synapses in the network. These results provide hypotheses for predicting how the profile of network bursts evolve due to dynamic changes in network heterogeneity.","doi":"10.1093/comnet/cnv011","startPage":"115","endPage":"126","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Complex Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016804/8155821/08155826.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Complex Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnv011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8155821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synaptic loss and synaptic plasticity in heterogeneous neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spike timing-dependent plasticity","acetylcholine","neural network","synchrony","network bursts"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8155826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Synaptic loss and synaptic plasticity in heterogeneous neural networks","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synaptic loss and synaptic plasticity in heterogeneous neural networks","sourcePdf":"cnv011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030017S","chronDate":"March  2016","isNumber":"8155821","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016804","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8155826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8157226,"authors":[{"name":"N.
