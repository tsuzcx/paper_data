The structures and connectivity of even the simplest invertebrates are almost impossible to establish with standard laboratory techniques, and even when this is possible it is generally time consuming, complex and expensive. Recent work has shown how a simplified behavioural approach to modelling neurons can allow \"virtual\" experiments to be carried out that map the behaviour of a simulated structure onto a hypothetical biological one, with correlation of behaviour rather than underlying connectivity. The problems with such approaches are numerous. The first is the difficulty of simulating realistic aggregates efficiently, the second is making sense of the results and finally, the models often take days to run therefore it would be advantageous to have a model which can be synthesized onto hardware. In this paper we present a synthesizable VHDL implementation of Neuron models that allow large aggregates to be simulated. The models are demonstrated using a post synthesis system level VHDL model of the C. Elegans locomotory system.","doi":"10.1109/BMAS.2008.4751231","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747412/4751228/04751231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMAS.2008.4751231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751228","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavioural Simulation and Synthesis of Biological Neuron Systems using VHDL","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Behavioural Simulation and Synthesis of Biological Neuron Systems using VHDL","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751231/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400017","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4751231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavioural Simulation and Synthesis of Biological Neuron Systems using VHDL","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"BMAS-00-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036143S","chronDate":"25-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747412","isNumber":"4751228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747412","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4751228","articleId":"4751231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751238,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Maure","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, ZI de Rousset, Rousset, France","Institut IM2NP, UMR CNRS 6137, Marseilles, France","Universite de Provence, Aix Marseille I, France"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Maure","id":"37659060500"},{"name":"Pierre Canet","affiliation":["Institut IM2NP, UMR CNRS 6137, Marseilles, France","Universite de Provence, Aix Marseille I, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Canet","id":"37328780100"},{"name":"Frederic Lalande","affiliation":["Institut IM2NP, UMR CNRS 6137, Marseilles, France","Universit\u00e9 Paul C\u00e9zanne (Aix-Marseille III), France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Lalande","id":"37403350800"},{"name":"Bertrand Delsuc","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, ZI de Rousset, Rousset, France"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Delsuc","id":"37659058000"},{"name":"Jean Devin","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, ZI de Rousset, Rousset, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Devin","id":"37552236500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2896-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-3804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-3812"}],"articleNumber":"4751238","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory cells","Nonvolatile memory","Electrons","Equations","Circuit simulation","Hardware design languages","Analytical models","Polarization","Electrodes","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memory cell compact modeling","Verilog-A","PSP MOS description","conduction channel behavior","floating gate potential","transient simulations","ELDO simulator","ICCAP software","STMicroelectronics technology"]}],"abstract":"In this work, a new compact Flash memory cell model is developed using Verilog-A.

However, illegal data access has become more easy and prevalent in wireless networks. In order to protect valuable data from undesirable readers, data encryption has become a critical issue. However, encryption techniques do not take into account wireless network characteristics such as noise and burst error. In this paper, a robust and secure approach for partial image encryption is proposed, that is utilized sub-band selection from discrete wavelet transform in order to meet the requirements of the robust image transmission, and the two chaotic logistic maps, less computationally intensive and high security is used to meet the requirements of the secure image transmission. Further, the proposed scheme is robustified by channel coding to deal with burst error included in wireless. The experimental results of the proposed scheme provide an efficient and secure way for real-time image encryption and transmission over wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/CCST.2008.4751276","startPage":"51","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Annual IEEE International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Annual IEEE International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747413/4751258/04751276.pdf","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2008.4751276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751276/","displayDocTitle":"A robust and secure scheme for image transmission over wireless channels","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4751276/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10400047","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust and secure scheme for image transmission over wireless channels","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092009-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069643S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747413","isNumber":"4751258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747413","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4751258","articleId":"4751276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4751283,"authors":[{"name":"Lawrence Muijlwijk","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Muijlwijk","id":"37659384800"},{"name":"Jonathan Scott","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Scott","id":"37289855800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1816-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1817-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1071-6572"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0742"}],"articleNumber":"4751283","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic signal detection","Acoustic sensors","Acoustic devices","Vibrations","Mechanical sensors","Interference","Acoustic transducers","Piezoelectric transducers","Microphones","Acoustic noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transducers","alarm systems","microcontrollers","piezoelectric transducers","safety devices","vibration measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic tamper detection sensor","false alarm","interference","vandalism","tampering","piezoelectric vibration transducer","embedded microcontroller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic transducers","Vibration measurement","Site security monitoring","Alarm systems","Security"]}],"abstract":"We describe a device designed to detect interference (vandalism or tampering) by acoustic means.

Experimental results show better recognition accuracies and reduced computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/CCST.2008.4751300","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Annual IEEE International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Annual IEEE International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747413/4751258/04751300.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2008.4751300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751258","startPage":"187","endPage":"190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition approach based on wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition approach based on wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751300/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400066","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4751300/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition approach based on wavelet transform","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092009-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098525S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747413","isNumber":"4751258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747413","xplore-issue":"4751258","articleId":"4751300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4751307,"authors":[{"name":"Belen Fernandez-Saavedra","affiliation":["University Carlos III of Madrid-Dpt.

Most of them could be avoided if acquisition sensors would have suitable approaches for aliveness detection at the capture process. Many providers claim that their products support these methods but unfortunately it has been discovered that some products do not detect fake samples. In this paper a methodology based on Common Criteria is given to evaluate, in an independent way, whether biometric capture devices implement methods for fake samples detection, and till which extent such methods are effective.

Such antennas need to be printable and de-embeddable from the terminating reactive network used for coding the tag information. We demonstrate that certain antennas have a low radar cross-section (RCS) under matched condition, while maintaining a fairly uniform RCS under various reactive terminations including open and short. Therefore, effect of such antennas can be deembedded after being modeled as two-port networks whose parameters can be extracted using conventional Vector Network measurement techniques.

A particular advantage of Doppler radar for HRV monitoring is the ability to detect and monitor heart and respiration signals simultaneously, and thus provide independent measures of HRV, and respiration-related fluctuations. High accuracy in obtaining HRV parameters using Doppler radar is achieved using linear demodulation method, including SDNN of about 10 ms, and mean beat to beat interval accuracy of close to 1 ms. In addition, respiration signals were obtained simultaneously with the heart signals, clearly showing a correlation between respiration cycles and heart rate variability.","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751478","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","startPage":"420","endPage":"423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751478.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart rate variability","Doppler radar","Demodulation","Heart rate","Remote monitoring","Cardiology","Stress","Radar detection","Particle measurements","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiovascular system","demodulation","Doppler radar","electrocardiography","medical signal detection","patient monitoring","pneumodynamics","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heart rate variability assessment","Doppler radar","linear demodulation method","HRV monitoring","beat-to-beat interval","cardiovascular regulatory system","heart signal detection","respiration signal detection","respiration-related fluctuation","respiration cycles","ECG"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Heart Rate Variability Assessment Using Doppler Radar with Linear Demodulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751478/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751478/","accessionNumber":"10400221","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart Rate Variability Assessment Using Doppler Radar with Linear Demodulation","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057011S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4751480,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Sub Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Sub","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281125700"},{"name":"Mun-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mun-Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405518800"},{"name":"Yoon-Ha Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon-Ha","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37278463700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-006-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4751480","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Multiaccess communication","Broadband amplifiers","MODFETs","Power amplifiers","Harmonics suppression","Power measurement","Gain measurement","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","gallium compounds","HEMT circuits","III-V semiconductors","microwave power amplifiers","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-efficiency class-E-cells-based GaN HEMT","Doherty amplifier","power-added efficiency","drain efficiency","channel leakage ratio","wide-band code division multiple access","power- added efficiency","GaN"]}],"abstract":"This paper represents a high-efficiency GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) class-E Doherty amplifier (CEDA) for wide-band code division multiple access (WCDMA) applications.

The paper presents the circuit concept for two and three stage SSAs, theoretical considerations for possible efficiency enhancements and experimental results for a two stage SSA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4751485/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400227","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi Stage Switched Sequential Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi Stage Switched Sequential Amplifier","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033295S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4751486,"authors":[{"name":"Debasis Dawn","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Debasis","lastName":"Dawn","id":"37311683200"},{"name":"Saikat Sarkar","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saikat","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37275242500"},{"name":"Padmanava Sen","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Padmanava","lastName":"Sen","id":"37275821400"},{"name":"Stephane Pinel","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Pinel","id":"37269060800"},{"name":"Joy Laskar","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Laskar","id":"37280282800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-006-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4751486","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Diodes","Transmission line measurements","Frequency measurement","Transmission lines","Topology","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Phase measurement","Gain measurement","Operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterojunction bipolar transistors","millimetre wave amplifiers","millimetre wave phase shifters","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon-based tunable amplifier","tunable transmission line","phase shift","on-chip multimetal-layer structure","diode switch topology","metal trace","HBT","tunable multiband amplifier","fully monolithic millimeter-wave tunable amplifiers","frequency 35 GHz to 65 GHz","gain 8 dB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751486","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751486.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60 GHz Silicon-Based Tunable Amplifier","abstract":"This paper presents, for the first time, 60 GHz silicon-based tunable amplifier development.

A metal trace, below the transmission line, is connected to a pair of diode switches, to be grounded or left floating depending on whether the switch is on or off, respectively. A base-collector shorted npn HBT is used as diode switch, and a phase difference of 20 is measured in the two different states of the tunable transmission line over 35 GHz ~ 65 GHz frequency range. A tunable multi-band amplifier is developed by using this tunable transmission line in the output-matching network. Measured results of the amplifier indicate 3 dB bandwidth of operation can be achieved over the entire frequency range of 40 GHz to 65 GHz with a maximum gain of 8 dB by switching the diode on or off.

In the application of a cavity, the proposed method produces 10% reduction of the run time than the alternating-direction implicit (ADI)-FDTD method and 35% than the split-step (SS)-FDTD (2,2) method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Dimensional Unconditionally-Stable FDTD Method Based on Split-Step Scheme and Crank-Nicolson Scheme","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751539","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751539.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Dimensional Unconditionally-Stable FDTD Method Based on Split-Step Scheme and Crank-Nicolson Scheme","conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751539/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400280","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Dimensional Unconditionally-Stable FDTD Method Based on Split-Step Scheme and Crank-Nicolson Scheme","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045299S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4751545,"authors":[{"name":"Kohei Mori","affiliation":["Semiconductor Business Group, Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan","Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Mori","id":"37066167700"},{"name":"Tatsuo Itoh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tatsuo","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37279606000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-006-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4751545","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":660},"abstract":"We propose a distributed amplifier integrated with a CRLH leaky wave antenna.

To coordinate the phase between the guided slow-wave in the microstrip section and fast-wave in the CRLH radiator, the length of the unit cell of the microstrip section is shortened and FETs are connected with a constant phase coupling line. The signal travels to each unit-cell through FETs and radiate from the CRLH antenna. This antenna radiates an amplified forward wave in the right hand region and an amplified backward wave in the left hand region. A 5 unit-cell prototype demonstrates the proposed active leaky wave antenna. The measured and simulated forward and reverse gains exhibit good agreement, and beam scanning can be observed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed amplifiers","Leaky wave antennas","FETs","Impedance","Propagation constant","Frequency response","Microstrip antennas","Couplings","Antennas and propagation","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","distributed amplifiers","field effect transistors","leaky wave antennas","microstrip lines","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed amplifier","CRLH-transmission line leaky wave antenna","interdigital capacitor","microstrip line","FET","antenna radiation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751545","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751545.pdf","startPage":"686","endPage":"689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Amplifier with CRLH-Transmission Line Leaky Wave Antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Amplifier with CRLH-Transmission Line Leaky Wave Antenna","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751545/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751545/","accessionNumber":"10400286","conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Amplifier with CRLH-Transmission Line Leaky Wave Antenna","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033422S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4751554,"authors":[{"name":"Hubregt J.

This paper presents detailed modulated measurements that aim to help clarify this problem and to isolate some of the contributors to what has now become a rather general `catch-all' term of `memory effects'. The analysis is based on modulated (two-tone) waveform measurements and envelope analysis of both a simple passive line structure, as well as an active 2W GaN die operating at 2.1 GHz and over a bandwidth of 80 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751562","startPage":"753","endPage":"756","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751562.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demystifying Device related Memory Effects using Waveform Engineering and Envelope Domain Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Demystifying Device related Memory Effects using Waveform Engineering and Envelope Domain Analysis","conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751562/","accessionNumber":"10414971","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751562/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demystifying Device related Memory Effects using Waveform Engineering and Envelope Domain Analysis","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075325S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751563,"authors":[{"name":"Jad Faraj","affiliation":["XLIM, Limoges University IUT GEII, Brive, France"],"firstName":"Jad","lastName":"Faraj","id":"37591230100"},{"name":"Fabien De Groote","affiliation":["IUT GEII, Verspecht-Teyssier-DeGroote s. a. s.

For a two-tone signal with 2-MHz tone spacing and a one-carrier WCDMA signal, the significant cancellation of the 3rd and 5th-order intermodulation (IM3 and IM5) components and a superior adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) improvement are achieved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751630","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751630.pdf","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1025","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Doherty Amplifier as a Predistortion Circuit for High Power Amplifier Linearization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of Doherty Amplifier as a Predistortion Circuit for High Power Amplifier Linearization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4751630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400357","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751630/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Doherty Amplifier as a Predistortion Circuit for High Power Amplifier Linearization","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048978S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4751640,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Digital techniques have emerged as most attractive approaches to correct the linear distortion introduced in the microwave and immediate frequency (IF) analogue signal paths. This paper presents a novel technique for correcting the channel frequency response (flattening amplitude and linearizing phase) on microwave spectrum analysers. By combining factory calibration data of the amplitude and phase response and run-time IF alignment, we can accomplish significant improvement in vector measurement performance. In contrast, traditional equalization of channel frequency response is only performed at a fixed IF frequency and the channel response variation over RF frequencies is mostly ignored. A cost-effective calibration solution can also be realized using an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and an off the shelf mixer to generate calibration signal.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearization techniques","Wideband","Microwave theory and techniques","Frequency response","Calibration","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal generators","Performance analysis","Distortion","Production facilities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","frequency response","linearisation techniques","spectral analysers","waveform generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude correction","phase linearization technique","channel frequency response","wideband microwave spectrum analysers","discrete Fourier transform","microwave frequency analogue signal paths","immediate frequency analogue signal paths","arbitrary waveform generator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751665","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751665.pdf","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Amplitude Correction and Phase Linearization Technique for Channel Response on Wideband Microwave Spectrum Analysers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Amplitude Correction and Phase Linearization Technique for Channel Response on Wideband Microwave Spectrum Analysers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751665/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751665/","accessionNumber":"10400388","conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Amplitude Correction and Phase Linearization Technique for Channel Response on Wideband Microwave Spectrum Analysers","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040233S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4751669,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoungjong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoungjong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37310775700"},{"name":"Gilwong Choi","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gilwong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37532124300"},{"name":"Jinjoo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinjoo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280084700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-006-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4751669","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751669","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","Gallium nitride","Operational amplifiers","Power amplifiers","HEMTs","Gain","Power generation","Distortion measurement","High power amplifiers","III-V semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","HEMT circuits","III-V semiconductors","intermodulation distortion","pulse amplifiers","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse operation","inverse class-F power amplifier","high electron mobility transistor","two-tone measurements","third-order intermodulation distortion","IMD3 measurement","tone spacing","peak power-added-efficiency","frequency 1 GHz","GaN"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an inverse class-F power amplifier (PA) based on gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) at 1 GHz.

EVM, output power levels, and spectral masks are obtained for a 72.2 Mbit/s, 64-QAM, 802.11n, OFDM signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4751677/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400399","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impedance Matching Techniques in 65nm CMOS Power Amplifiers for 2.4GHz 802.11n WLAN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance Matching Techniques in 65nm CMOS Power Amplifiers for 2.4GHz 802.11n WLAN","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053056S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4751682,"authors":[{"name":"Kin-Joe Sham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Kin-Joe","lastName":"Sham","id":"37294440900"},{"name":"Ramesh Harjani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Harjani","id":"37275606500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-006-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4751682","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Crosstalk","Voltage","Bit error rate","Power measurement","Transmitters","Degradation","Bandwidth","Throughput","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer interfaces","crosstalk","integrated circuit noise","interference (signal)","jitter","semiconductor storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input/output staggering","low-power jitter reduction","far-end crosstalk","high-speed memory I/O interfaces","bit rate 12 Gbit/s","voltage 373 mV to 215 mV"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we have developed simplified analytical models for far-end crosstalk that points us in a direction to an ultra-low power technique for reducing crosstalk-induced jitter in existing high-speed memory I/O interfaces. This new architecture design introduces variable delays in alternating lines at the transmitter to mitigate crosstalk-induced jitter. The power-efficient technique decreases jitter at the expense of lowering the voltage margin. The architecture has been verified via simulations and direct measurements. Simulation results at 12 Gb/s show that staggered I/Os can successfully reduce jitter by 66.7% and widen the eye by 15.0% while only degrading the voltage margin by 19.5%. Measurement results obtained at 600 Mb/s confirm the presented theoretical framework and show the removal of CIJ at the expense of decreasing the voltage margin from 373 mV to 215 mV.","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751682","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751682.pdf","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"I/O Staggering for Low-Power Jitter Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751682/","displayDocTitle":"I/O Staggering for Low-Power Jitter Reduction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400404","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751682/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I/O Staggering for Low-Power Jitter Reduction","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046583S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4751708,"authors":[{"name":"I.

One of the most critical components is the front-end power amplifier in this system. The paper analyzes different technologies with potential in the E-band frequency range and present a power amplifier design satisfying the E-band system specifications. The designed power amplifier achieves a maximum output power of ges 20 dBm with a state-of-the-art power-added efficiency of 15%. The power is realized using InP DHBT technology. To the best of our knowledge it is the highest output power and efficiency reported for an InP HBT power amplifier in this frequency range. The predicted power-added efficiency is higher than that of power amplifiers based on SiGe HBT and GaAs pHEMT technologies. The design shows the capabilities of InP DHBT for power amplifier applications as an alternative to HEMT based technologies in the millimeter-wave frequency range.","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2008.4751721","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1381","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747408/4751336/04751721.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 38th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Amplifier Design for E-band Wireless System Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power Amplifier Design for E-band Wireless System Communications","conferenceDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751721/","accessionNumber":"10477958","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751721/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Amplifier Design for E-band Wireless System Communications","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EuMC-00-385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049359S","chronDate":"27-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747408","isNumber":"4751336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747408","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4751336","articleId":"4751721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4751727,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The chip delivers about 40 dBm of saturated output power, in CW operating conditions, at 11.7 GHz central frequency, with 17% of bandwidth. The saturated power gain is 12.4 dB with 2 dB gain flatness across the application bandwidth while the chip power added efficiency is estimated between 33% to 47%. The amplifier is designed to be used as final stage of a downlink satellite transmitter for Tracking Telemetry & Command system. A commercial power p-HEMT process capable of handling a power density higher than 1 W/mm has been selected for the MMIC design. Due to the space application, special attention must be put on the process and MMIC reliability: to this aim performances must be guaranteed in de-rated conditions respect to the process maximum ratings and, in addition, the channel temperature of the active devices must be kept within the value established by Space Requirements and carefully controlled. This makes the design objective very tight.

When it is driven by an OFDM signal, a 10 dB output power back-off is necessary to have a -25 dBc ACPR and PAE decreases down to 10%.

High throughput implementation of the detection unit for MIMO systems is a significant challenge. This challenge becomes still harder, because the above mentioned standards demand support for multiple modulation and coding schemes. This implies that the MIMO detector must be dynamically reconfigurable. Also, to achieve required bit error rate (BER) or frame error rate (FER) performance, the detector has to provide soft values to advanced forward error correction (FEC) schemes like turbo Codes. This paper presents an ASIC implementation of a novel MIMO detector architecture that is able to reconfigure on the fly and provides soft values as output. The design is implemented in 45 nm predictive technology library, and has a parallelism factor of four. The detector has many qualities of a systolic architecture and achieves a continuous throughput of 1 Gbps for QPSK, 500 Mbps for 16-QAM, and 187.5 Mbps for 64-QAM.

We present novel 3D-NoC synthesis algorithms that make use of accurate power and delay models for 3D wiring with through-silicon vias. In particular, we present a very efficient 3D-NoC synthesis algorithm called ripup-reroute-and-router-merging (RRRM), that is based on a rip-up and reroute formulation for routing flows and a router merging procedure for network optimization. Experimental results on 3D-NoC design cases show that our synthesis results can on average achieve a 74% reduction in power consumption and a 17% reduction in hop count over regular 3D mesh implementations and a 52% reduction in power consumption and a 17% reduction in hop count over optimized 3D mesh implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of application-specific 3D Networks-on-Chip architectures","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751853","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751853.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of application-specific 3D Networks-on-Chip architectures","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751853/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466576","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of application-specific 3D Networks-on-Chip architectures","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11532S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751858,"authors":[{"name":"Baker Mohammad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Baker","lastName":"Mohammad","id":"37574033300"},{"name":"Stephen Bijansky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Bijansky","id":"37282515000"},{"name":"Adnan Aziz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37276166400"},{"name":"Jacob Abraham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37276152300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4751858","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Stability","Frequency","Threshold voltage","Jacobian matrices","Manufacturing","Voltage control","Registers","Timing","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive SRAM memory","transistors","minimum sized devices","guard banding","multiple supply voltages","fine-grained control"]}],"abstract":"SRAMs typically represent half of the area and more than half of the transistors on a chip today. Variability increases as feature size decreases, and the impact of variability is especially pronounced on SRAMs since they make extensive use of minimum sized devices. Variability leads to a large amount of guard banding in the design phase in order to meet frequency and yield targets. We develop an SRAM architecture that eliminates guard banding. Specifically, our SRAM uses multiple supply voltages that are assigned post-manufacturing. We compensate for variation by powering up manufactured devices that are slower than designed. Specifically, we assign supply voltages to 6T cells on a per-column basis; this gives us sufficiently fine-grained control over devices without excessive area overhead. We show that post-manufacturing voltage assignment results in a 28% reduction in bitline energy compared to a fixed voltage design for the same yield using data from a real-world 45 nm process.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751858.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive SRAM memory for low power and high yield","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive SRAM memory for low power and high yield","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466578","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4751858/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive SRAM memory for low power and high yield","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055206S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751865,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Chul Cha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jae Chul","lastName":"Cha","id":"37652420000"},{"name":"Sandeep K.

As these processes have increasingly higher defect rates, especially when they are first adopted, such early migration necessitates the use of increasing levels of redundancy to obtain high yield (per area). We show that as we move into nanometer processes with high defect rates, the level of redundancy needed to optimize yield-per-area is sufficiently high so as to significantly influence design tradeoffs. We then report a first step towards considering the overheads of redundancy during design optimization by characterizing the tradeoffs between the granularity of a design and the level of redundancy that optimizes the yield-per-area of static RAMs (SRAMs). Starting with physical layouts of cells and the desired memory size, we derive probabilities of failure at a range of abstractions - transistor level, cell level, and system level. We then estimate optimal memory granularity, i.e., the size of memory blocks, as well as the optimal number of spare rows and columns that maximize yield-per-area. In particular, we demonstrate the non-monotonic nature of these tradeoffs and present efficient designs for large SRAMs. Our ongoing research is characterizing several other specific tradeoffs, for SRAMs as well as logic blocks.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751865.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751865","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of granularity and redundancy for SRAMs for optimal yield-per-area","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of granularity and redundancy for SRAMs for optimal yield-per-area","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751865/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4751865/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400756","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of granularity and redundancy for SRAMs for optimal yield-per-area","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089253S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751873,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Ye","affiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Ye","id":"37650041500"},{"name":"Aravind Pavuluri","affiliation":["VMware, Inc."],"firstName":"Aravind","lastName":"Pavuluri","id":"37660307700"},{"name":"Carl A.

In this contribution, we observe that operating at minimum-energy point is not straightforward as design constraints from real-life applications have an important impact on energy. Therefore, we introduce the alternative concept of practical energy, taking functional-yield and throughput constraints on minimum V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n into account. In this context, we demonstrate for the first time the detrimental impact of DIBL on minimum V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n. Practical energy gives a useful analysis framework of circuit optimization to reach minimum-energy point, while considering the throughput as an input variable dictated by the application. From simulation of a benchmark multiplier in 45 nm technology, we find out that practical energy can be far higher than minimum energy point, in the case of low-throughput applications (ap 10-100 kOp/s) because of static leakage energy and robustness-limited minimum V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n. With the proposed framework, we investigate the capability of conventional optimization techniques to make practical energy meet minimum energy point. Amongst these techniques, channel length upsize is shown to be more efficient than MTCMOS power gating, body biasing, Vt selection or device width upsize, as it increases robustness while simultaneously reducing static leakage energy. A small length upsize with low area overhead is shown to reduce practical energy at low throughput to less than 2.1 times the minimum energy level. At medium throughput, it even brings practical energy 30% lower than minimum energy level without optimization techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751876","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751876.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","startPage":"294","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and minimization of practical energy in 45nm subthreshold logic circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and minimization of practical energy in 45nm subthreshold logic circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751876/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466585","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4751876/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and minimization of practical energy in 45nm subthreshold logic circuits","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077361S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4751877,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Chiang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"lastName":"Kai-Chiang Wu","id":"37278661700"},{"name":"Diana Marculescu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"Marculescu","id":"37273684500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4751877","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Logic circuits","Combinational circuits","Sequential circuits","Error correction codes","Computer errors","Logic gates","Robustness","Degradation","Flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit reliability","low-power electronics","nanoelectronics","power aware computing","radiation effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanoscale integrated circuits","power-aware soft error hardening","selective voltage scaling","dual supply voltages","normalized power-delay-area product","power overhead"]}],"abstract":"Nanoscale integrated circuits are becoming increasingly sensitive to radiation-induced transient faults (soft errors) due to current technology scaling trends, such as shrinking feature sizes and reducing supply voltages. Soft errors, which have been a significant concern in memories, are now a main factor in reliability degradation of logic circuits. This paper presents a power-aware methodology using dual supply voltages for soft error hardening. Given a constraint on power overhead, our proposed framework can minimize the soft error rate (SER) of a circuit via selective voltage scaling. On average, circuit SER can be reduced by 33.45% for various sizes of transient glitches with only 11.74% energy increase. The overhead in normalized power-delay-area product per 1% SER reduction is 0.64%, 1.33X less than that of existing state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751877","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","startPage":"301","endPage":"306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-aware soft error hardening via selective voltage scaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power-aware soft error hardening via selective voltage scaling","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751877/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10477964","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4751877/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-aware soft error hardening via selective voltage scaling","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141494S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751878,"authors":[{"name":"Ilya Wagner","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37288962700"},{"name":"Valeria Bertacco","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Bertacco","id":"37267142300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4751878","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":639},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751878","abstract":"Verification remains an integral and crucial phase of todaypsilas microprocessor design and manufacturing process. Unfortunately, with soaring design complexities and decreasing time-to-market windows, todaypsilas verification approaches are incapable of fully validating a microprocessor before its release to the public. Increasingly, post-silicon validation is deployed to detect complex functional bugs in addition to exposing electrical and manufacturing defects. This is due to the significantly higher execution performance offered by post-silicon methods, compared to pre-silicon approaches. Validation in the post-silicon domain is predominantly carried out by executing constrained-random test instruction sequences directly on a hardware prototype. However, to identify errors, the state obtained from executing tests directly in hardware must be compared to the one produced by an architectural simulation of the designpsilas golden model. Therefore, the speed of validation is severely limited by the necessity of a costly simulation step. In this work we address this bottleneck in the traditional flow and present a novel solution for post-silicon validation that exposes its native high performance. Our framework, called Reversi, generates random programs in such a way that their correct final state is known at generation time, eliminating the need for architectural simulations. Our experiments show that Reversi generates tests exposing more bugs faster, and can speed up post-silicon validation by 20x compared to traditional flows.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","startPage":"307","endPage":"314","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751878.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversi: Post-silicon validation system for modern microprocessors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microprocessors","Hardware","Computer bugs","Prototypes","Silicon","Virtual prototyping","Automatic testing","Software testing","System testing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit manufacture","integrated circuit testing","logic design","logic testing","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reversi framework","microprocessor design","post-silicon validation system","manufacturing process","verification approach","complex functional bug","electrical defect","manufacturing defect","constrained-random test instruction sequence","hardware prototype","architectural simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reversi: Post-silicon validation system for modern microprocessors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751878/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4751878/","accessionNumber":"10400763","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversi: Post-silicon validation system for modern microprocessors","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077628S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4751883,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Our verification methodology addressed this problem by using a hierarchy of RTL, architectural, and numerical simulations. Block- and chip-level RTL models were verified by means of extensive co-simulation with a detailed C++ architectural simulator, ensuring that the RTL models could perform the same molecular dynamics computations as the architectural simulator. The output of the architectural simulator was compared to a parallelized numerical simulator that produces bitwise identical results to Anton, and is fast enough to verify the long-term numerical stability of computations on Anton. These explicit couplings between adjacent levels of the simulation hierarchy created a continuous verification chain from molecular dynamics to individual logic gates.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751883","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751883.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"347","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical simulation-based verification of Anton, a special-purpose parallel machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical simulation-based verification of Anton, a special-purpose parallel machine","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4751883/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10477965","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751883/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical simulation-based verification of Anton, a special-purpose parallel machine","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064982S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4751886,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Pellegrini","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Pellegrini","id":"37408157000"},{"name":"Kypros Constantinides","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Kypros","lastName":"Constantinides","id":"37298045400"},{"name":"Dan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"lastName":"Dan Zhang","id":"37655556000"},{"name":"Shobana Sudhakar","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Shobana","lastName":"Sudhakar","id":"37660376800"},{"name":"Valeria Bertacco","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Bertacco","id":"37267142300"},{"name":"Todd Austin","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Austin","id":"37267010600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4751886","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CrashTest: A fast high-fidelity FPGA-based resiliency analysis framework","abstract":"Extreme scaling practices in silicon technology are quickly leading to integrated circuit components with limited reliability, where phenomena such as early-transistor failures, gate-oxide wearout, and transient faults are becoming increasingly common. In order to overcome these issues and develop robust design techniques for large-market silicon ICs, it is necessary to rely on accurate failure analysis frameworks which enable design houses to faithfully evaluate both the impact of a wide range of potential failures and the ability of candidate reliable mechanisms to overcome them. Unfortunately, while failure rates are already growing beyond economically viable limits, no fault analysis framework is yet available that is both accurate and can operate on a complex integrated system. To address this void, we present CrashTest, a fast, high-fidelity and flexible resiliency analysis system. Given a hardware description model of the design under analysis, CrashTest is capable of orchestrating and performing a comprehensive design resiliency analysis by examining how the design reacts to faults while running software applications. Upon completion, CrashTest provides a high-fidelity analysis report obtained by performing a fault injection campaign at the gate-level netlist of the design. The fault injection and analysis process is significantly accelerated by the use of an FPGA hardware emulation platform. We conducted experimental evaluations on a range of systems, including a complex LEON-based system-on-chip, and evaluated the impact of gate-level injected faults at the system level. We found that CrashTest is 16-90x faster than an equivalent software-based framework, when analyzing designs through direct primary I/Os. As shown by our LEON-based SoC experiments, CrashTest exhibits emulation speeds that are six orders of magnitude faster than simulation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crashes","Circuit faults","Performance analysis","Silicon","Failure analysis","Hardware","Emulation","Integrated circuit technology","Integrated circuit reliability","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CrashTest","high-fidelity resiliency analysis framework","hardware description model","fault injection","LEON-based SoC experiment","silicon technology","field programmable gate array","FPGA hardware emulation platform","robust design techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4751886","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751886","startPage":"363","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740204/4751825/04751886.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4751825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751886/","displayDocTitle":"CrashTest: A fast high-fidelity FPGA-based resiliency analysis framework","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10466589","htmlLink":"/document/4751886/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CrashTest: A fast high-fidelity FPGA-based resiliency analysis framework","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078651S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751896,"authors":[{"name":"Hani H.

Modification/ re-optimization of SRAM cell and/or tuning of process parameters to meet target performance and stability are limited by area constraints and involve several technology ramp-up cycles. For reducing access failures, if process is not fine tuned, memory access clock cycle period may need to be increased thereby compromising performance. We propose a design methodology to meet the target performance and reduce access failures by tuning the SRAM array peripherals instead of tuning the SRAM cell and process parameters. Proposed design methodology is supported by numerical framework and validated by simulation results on 45 nm PDSOI technology. We further show that our methodology does not impact the READ stability of a cell.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4751901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10477966","htmlLink":"/document/4751901/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pre-Si estimation and compensation of SRAM layout deficiencies to achieve target performance and yield","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-Si estimation and compensation of SRAM layout deficiencies to achieve target performance and yield","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069519S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740204","isNumber":"4751825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740204","xplore-issue":"4751825","articleId":"4751901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4751906,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Hadke","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Hadke","id":"37660455100"},{"name":"Tony Benavides","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Benavides","id":"37297018100"},{"name":"Rajeevan Amirtharajah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajeevan","lastName":"Amirtharajah","id":"37294466400"},{"name":"Matthew Farrens","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Farrens","id":"37324288900"},{"name":"Venkatesh Akella","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Akella","id":"37273557300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"4751906","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Optical interconnections","Bandwidth","Energy consumption","Optical computing","Delay","Scalability","Multicore processing","Clocks","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","optical interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical CPU-DRAM interconnect","CPU-DRAM interface","fully-buffered DIMM","total power consumption","memory subsystem","balanced computing"]}],"abstract":"We present OCDIMM (Optically Connected DIMM), a CPU-DRAM interface that uses multiwavelength optical interconnects.

Recently, significant advancements have been made on algebraic soft-decision decoding (ASD) of RS codes. These algorithms can achieve substantial coding gain with polynomial complexity. One major step of ASD is the interpolation. Various techniques have been proposed to reduce the complexity of this step. Further speedup of this step is limited by the inherent serial nature of the interpolation algorithm. In this paper, taking the bit-level generalized minimum distance (BGMD) ASD as an example, we propose a novel technique to combine the computations from multiple interpolation iterations.

It is an important factor that determines quality and cost of the product assembly. Cost in assembly can be reduced by the implementation of generating automatic product assembly sequences, and selecting the optimum sequence in product assembly process. Assembly sequence planning (ASP) is combinatorial problem. Graph-based algorithms are adopted for traditional ASP method. In recent years, some genetic algorithms and simulated annealing algorithms have been used to solve ASP problems, and some achievements are arrived at. However, the two kinds of algorithms have limitations for ASP. GA heavily depends on the choosing original sequence, which can result in early convergence in iterative operation, lower searching efficiency in evolutionary process, and non-optimization of final result for global variable. For simulated annealing algorithms, the principle of generating new sequence is exchanging position of the randomly selected two parts. Obviously, for complex products, a number of non-feasible solutions may appear, and the efficiency is low. In view of these limitations, the approach of combining GA and SA is proposed to build genetic simulated annealing algorithm for the optimization of ASP. In this paper, the following contents are included. Firstly, the relevant researches on assembly sequence planning and the application of GA and SA are summarized. Next, the idea of combining the two algorithms into genetic simulated annealing algorithm is put forward, which aims at improving the efficiency of problem solving. Thirdly, the genetic simulated annealing algorithm for assembly sequence planning is implemented, the method, procedure as well as key techniques of the genetic simulated annealing algorithm are addressed in detail and the principles for selecting parameters are studied to achieve better performance of the algorithm. Fourthly, a case study is presented to validate the proposed method. In the case, GA, SA and genetic simulated annealing algorithm are applied to ASP respectively, and the results verify the advantages of the genetic simulated annealing algorithm in solving the ASP problem.

This article focuses on wireless systems using HARQ with emphasis on the multiple-input multiple-output paradigm. MIMO-HARQ offers new opportunities because of the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver. The architecture of MIMO transceivers that are based on bit-interleaved coded modulation and employ HARQ is described. Additionally, receiver implementations are presented and compared in terms of complexity, memory requirements, and performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4752663/04752674.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4752663","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver design for MIMO wireless systems incorporating hybrid ARQ","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","MIMO","Automatic repeat request","Throughput","Forward error correction","Error correction","Modulation coding","Decoding","Interleaved codes","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","automatic repeat request","error correction codes","forward error correction","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","modulation coding","protocols","resource allocation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO wireless system","hybrid automatic repeat request","HARQ protocol","forward error correction coding","retransmission scheme","resource utilization","transceiver design","multiple antenna","bit-interleaved coded modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver design for MIMO wireless systems incorporating hybrid ARQ","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4752674/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10473427","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transceiver design for MIMO wireless systems incorporating hybrid ARQ","sourcePdf":"011TOUMPAKARIS LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04256S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4752663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4752663","articleId":"4752674","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4752675,"authors":[{"name":"Cheran M.

To contend with deleterious channel fading effects, both the transmitter and the receiver must be designed appropriately to exploit the diversity embedded in the channels. From the perspective of receiver design, the ultimate goal is to achieve both low complexity and high performance. In this article, we first summarize the complexity and performance of low-complexity receivers, including linear equalizers and decision feedback equalizers, and then we reveal the fundamental condition when LEs and DFEs collect the same diversity as the maximum-likelihood equalizer. Recently, lattice reduction techniques were introduced to enhance the performance of low-complexity equalizers without increasing the complexity significantly. Thus, we also provide a comprehensive review of LR-aided low-complexity equalizers and analyze their performance. Furthermore, we describe the architecture and initial results of a very-large-scale-integration implementation of an LR algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4752663/04752677.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4752663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing low-complexity equalizers for wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752677/","displayDocTitle":"Designing low-complexity equalizers for wireless systems","volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10473423","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4752677/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing low-complexity equalizers for wireless systems","sourcePdf":"014MA LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079312S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4752663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4752663","articleId":"4752677","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4752678,"authors":[{"name":"Per Odling","affiliation":["Lund University, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Per \u00d6dling received his Ph.D. in Signal Processing in 1995 from Lule\u00e4 University of Technology, Sweden.

The background noise, although often characterized as Gaussian, is not white, but has a decaying power spectral density. The channel capacity depends on the distance, and may be extremely limited. Because acoustic propagation is best supported at low frequencies, although the total available bandwidth may be low, an acoustic communication system is inherently wideband in the sense that the bandwidth is not negligible with respect to its center frequency. The channel can have a sparse impulse response, where each physical path acts as a time-varying low-pass filter, and motion introduces additional Doppler spreading and shifting. Surface waves, internal turbulence, fluctuations in the sound speed, and other small-scale phenomena contribute to random signal variations. At this time, there are no standardized models for the acoustic channel fading, and experimental measurements are often made to assess the statistical properties of the channel in particular deployment sites.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4752663/04752682.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4752663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater acoustic communication channels: Propagation models and statistical characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","displayDocTitle":"Underwater acoustic communication channels: Propagation models and statistical characterization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752682/","publicationDate":"January 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10478707","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4752682/","volume":"47","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 February 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater acoustic communication channels: Propagation models and statistical characterization","sourcePdf":"019STOJANOVIC LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062191S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4752663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"874","xplore-issue":"4752663","articleId":"4752682","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4752683,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew C.

To make underwater applications viable, efficient communication protocols among underwater devices, which are based on acoustic wireless technology for distances over one hundred meters, must be enabled because of the high attenuation and scattering that affect radio and optical waves, respectively. The unique characteristics of an underwater acoustic channel - such as very limited and distance-dependent bandwidth, high propagation delays, and time-varying multipath and fading - require new, efficient and reliable communication protocols to network multiple devices, either static or mobile, potentially over multiple hops.

Radio systems have moved toward forming heterogeneous wireless networks: collaborations of multiple radio access networks, which in some cases operate different radio access technologies, such as second- and third-generation cellular RATs, IEEE 802.x wireless standards, and so on. On the other hand, multimode reconfigurable user devices with the ability to choose among various supported RATs have become a reality, and devices and networks with dynamic spectrum access capabilities, allowing real-time sharing of spectrum resource usage among different systems, are expected to be a part of the future radio eco-space. As a result of these changes, there is a need to develop a standard that addresses the requirements and leverages the opportunities posed by such a versatile radio environment. To this end, IEEE 1900.4 aims to standardize the overall system architecture and information exchange between the network and mobile devices, which will allow these elements to optimally choose from available radio resources. In other words, the standard facilitates the distributed dynamic optimization of the usage of spectrum offered by the heterogeneous wireless network, relying on a collaborative information exchange between networks and mobile devices, thereby acting as a common means to improve overall composite capacity and quality of service for the served networks. This article provides a snapshot of IEEE P1900.4 in its current form, covering the scope and purpose of the standard, reference use cases for which the standard is applicable, its system and functional architectures, and finally, the information model for its main interfaces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 February 2009","volume":"47","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"10478709","publicationDate":"January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4752689/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Architecture and enablers for optimized radio resource usage in heterogeneous wireless access networks: The IEEE 1900.4 Working Group","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture and enablers for optimized radio resource usage in heterogeneous wireless access networks: The IEEE 1900.4 Working Group","sourcePdf":"026TSAGKARIS LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0889S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4752663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4752663","articleId":"4752689","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4752724,"authors":[{"name":"Joachim N.

We extend a 1-D model of the bias dependence of the electric field in a p-n junction in DRAM to a 2-D model. The validity of the new model is confirmed by simulations and experiments. We then find that the electric-field strength in DRAM can be easily evaluated by measuring the substrate-bias dependence of the off-state leakage current of DRAM by using a test element group. The simulated electric-field strength does not always correspond to actual situations, so our method is very useful to monitor the electric-field strength in an actual device.

Aside from the use of a dc-dc converter in combination with a single PV converter, it is possible to boost the voltage by the monolithic serial interconnection of several converter segments on a single chip, often called multiple converters. Another novel approach introduced in this paper is a multijunction PV cell, where several subcells of the same material are stacked onto a substrate and interconnected by interband tunnel diodes. This paper explores a tandem GaAs-GaAs converter and compares the results with a 2-V multiple PV converter under monochromatic laser illumination. In addition, 4-V multiple PV converters with maximum monochromatic efficiencies (810 nm) of up to 50.1% at 51.6 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 6-V converters are investigated.

Since human grading is always time-consuming and subjective, this paper presents a computer-aided system to automatically grade pathological images according to Gleason grading system which is the most widespread method for histological grading of prostate tissues. We proposed two feature extraction methods based on fractal dimension to analyze variations of intensity and texture complexity in regions of interest. Each image can be classified into an appropriate grade by using Bayesian, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-NN, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, respectively.

If our fractal-based feature set is optimized by the sequential floating forward selection method, the CCR can be promoted up to 94.6%, 94.2%, and 94.6%, respectively, using each of the above three classifiers. Experimental results also show that our feature set is better than the feature sets extracted from multiwavelets, Gabor filters, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix methods because it has a much smaller size and still keeps the most powerful discriminating capability in grading prostate images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4752738/","accessionNumber":"10731474","pubMedId":"19164082","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Classification for Pathological Prostate Images Based on Fractal Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Classification for Pathological Prostate Images Based on Fractal Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmi-phuang-2012704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164598S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5109823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"5109823","articleId":"4752738","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4752747,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Ma","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Ma","id":"37407134400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4752747","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1362},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote sensing","Iterative decoding","Costs","Energy consumption","Encoding","Probes","Sampling methods","Compressed sensing","Data acquisition","Memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","data compression","geophysical signal processing","image coding","image sampling","iterative decoding","remote sensing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single pixel remote sensing","compressed sensing sampling theory","aerospace remote sensing","data acquisition reduction","imaging cost reduction","direct pixel recording","encoding imaging","noiselet transform based single pixel imaging","random Fourier sampling based multipixel imaging","iterative curvelet thresholding method","onboard imaging cost","offline decoding recovery","numerical experiments","Chang'e-1 lunar probe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerospace remote sensing","compressed sensing (CS)/compressive sampling","curvelets","lunar probe","single-pixel imaging","sparse recovery"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we apply a new sampling theory named compressed sensing (CS) for aerospace remote sensing to reduce data acquisition and imaging cost.

The CS remote sensing includes two steps: encoding imaging and decoding recovery. A noiselet-transform-based single-pixel imaging and a random Fourier-sampling-based multipixel imaging are alternatively used for encoding, and an iterative curvelet thresholding method is used for decoding. The new sensing mechanism shifts onboard imaging cost to offline decoding recovery.

The algorithm is based on the minimization of the entropy of the average range profile (ARP), and the processing chain is capable of exploiting the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform. With respect to the existing global methods, the new one requires no exhaustive search operation and eliminates the necessity of the parametric model for the relative offset among the range profiles. The derivation of the algorithm indicates that the presented methodology is essentially an iterative solution to a set of simultaneous equations, and its robustness is also ensured by the iterative structure. Some alternative criteria, such as the maximum contrast of the ARP, can be introduced into the algorithm with a minor change in the entropy-based method. The convergence and robustness of the presented algorithm have been validated by experimental ISAR data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4814847/04752748.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2010562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.2010562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust ISAR Range Alignment via Minimizing the Entropy of the Average Range Profile","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Entropy","Iterative algorithms","Inverse synthetic aperture radar","Polynomials","Fast Fourier transforms","Parametric statistics","Iterative methods","Extraterrestrial measurements","Minimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","geophysical techniques","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["range alignment","inverse synthetic aperture radar","ISAR image formation","entropy minimization","average range profile","fast Fourier transform","parametric model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average range profile (ARP)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","minimum entropy","range alignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust ISAR Range Alignment via Minimizing the Entropy of the Average Range Profile","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4752748/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572768","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust ISAR Range Alignment via Minimizing the Entropy of the Average Range Profile","sourcePdf":"lgrs-zhu-2010562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053876S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4814847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"4814847","articleId":"4752748","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4752753,"authors":[{"name":"Freek Baalbergen","affiliation":["Department of High Voltage Components and Power Systems, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4897610/4752753/4752753-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Freek Baalbergen (S'08) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the High Voltage Components and Power Systems Group.","His main topics of interest are energy storage, state estimation, smart grids, and phasor measurements."]},"firstName":"Freek","lastName":"Baalbergen","id":"37590984900"},{"name":"Pavol Bauer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Energy Conversion, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4897610/4752753/4752753-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Pavol Bauer (SM'07) received the Masters degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia, in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree from Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 1995.","He received the title of Professor from the President of the Czech Republic at the Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic, in 2008.

The reason for this is twofold. First of all, the efficiency of a diesel generator is dependent on the ratio determined by the average power divided by the peak power of the generator. The smaller this ratio is, the lower the efficiency. Furthermore, some loads can regenerate energy. In small grids, this energy is mostly not needed elsewhere and should be dissipated. A solution solving both problems previously mentioned is using an energy storage device in the system. This storage can be used for peak shaving and storing regenerated energy. This paper focuses on a generator-set with energy storage. Six different power management strategies are discussed. Calculation of the costs shows that adding an energy storage device lowers the cost for all methods.

In order to analyze the fluorescence lifetime, the proposed CMOS image sensor has two charge transfer stages using a pinned photodiode structure in which the first charge transfer stage is for the time-resolved sifting of fluorescence in all the pixels simultaneously and the second charge transfer stage is for reading the signals in each pixel sequentially with correlated double sampling operation. A 0.18-mum CMOS image sensor technology with a pinned photodiode process option is used for the implementation of a 256 times 256 CMOS image sensor. The decaying images and lifetimes of fura-2 solutions having different concentrations are successfully measured with a 250-ps time step using the CMOS image sensor and ultraviolet laser diode as a light source.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4757346/04752758.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.2011678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.2011678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel Two-Stage Charge Transfer for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluorescence","Photodiodes","Pixel","Charge transfer","Electric potential","CMOS image sensors","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","fluorescence","photodiodes","time resolved spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","in-pixel two-stage charge transfer","fluorescence lifetime imaging","subnanosecond time resolution","charge transfer","pinned photodiode structure","second charge transfer stage","ultraviolet laser diode","size 0.18 mum","time 250 ps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","fluorescence lifetime imaging","time-resolved image","two charge transfer stages"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel Two-Stage Charge Transfer for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4752758/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416691","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel Two-Stage Charge Transfer for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging","sourcePdf":"ted-yoon-2011678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050074S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4757346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4757346","articleId":"4752758","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4752759,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4757346/4752759/4752759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Li received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, in 2006.

The thermal resistance of the CF and the activation energy for the dissolution mechanism are then evaluated, allowing for a physics-based numerical modeling of the reset operation based on CF thermal breakup.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.2010583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4757346/04752764.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.2010583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filament Conduction and Reset Mechanism in NiO-Based Resistive-Switching Memory (RRAM) Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Filament Conduction and Reset Mechanism in NiO-Based Resistive-Switching Memory (RRAM) Devices","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4752764/","accessionNumber":"10416692","volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filament Conduction and Reset Mechanism in NiO-Based Resistive-Switching Memory (RRAM) Devices","sourcePdf":"ted-ielmini-2010583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086474S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4757346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"265","xplore-issue":"4757346","articleId":"4752764","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4752766,"authors":[{"name":"Do-Yun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4752766/4752766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Do-Yun Kim (S'05) was born in Seoul, Korea, on November 13, 1979.

In order to evaluate the RFID reader-to-reader interference quantitatively, the interrogation-range-reduction ratio (IRRR) is also defined.

Reader-reader distance achieving 0% IRRR, indicating no interference between the readers, is 1200 m for the multiple-reader environment. Additionally, IRRR values are calculated in various environments according to the North American and Korean regulations.

An SMC law is designed to force a coupled sliding surface (which consists of sliding surfaces of both actuated and unactuated subsystems) to be reached in finite time, such that zero dynamics are generated in the form of a second-order damped and forced nonlinear differential equation. The stability analysis is provided to show that the resulting zero dynamics is guaranteed to be semiglobally asymptotically stable over the upper half-plane as well as over the whole plane except the horizon. This property is maintained even in the presence of the matched disturbance by virtue of the sliding-mode approach. Using the semiglobal nature of the stability of the zero dynamics, the aggressive swing-up (in one time, without swinging motion) and stabilization control can be achieved by a single coupled SMC law, without involving the switching (or hybrid) scheme in the previous works. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in both numerical simulations and experiments for the swing-up and stabilization control of inverted-pendulum systems such as cart-pendulum and Furuta-pendulum.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2012452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5200775/04752767.pdf","startPage":"3541","endPage":"3555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2012452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Swing-Up and Stabilization Control of Inverted-Pendulum Systems via Coupled Sliding-Mode Control Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752767/","displayDocTitle":"Swing-Up and Stabilization Control of Inverted-Pendulum Systems via Coupled Sliding-Mode Control Method","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816635","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4752767/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Swing-Up and Stabilization Control of Inverted-Pendulum Systems via Coupled Sliding-Mode Control Method","sourcePdf":"tie-chwa-2012452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151244S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5200775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5200775","articleId":"4752767","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4752770,"authors":[{"name":"De Xu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4897610/4752770/4752770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["De Xu (M'05) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in control science and engineering from Shandong University of Technology, Jinan, China, in 1985 and 1990, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2001.","Since 2001, he has been with the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, where he is currently a Professor with the Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science.

The joint optimization framework includes two coupled blocks, one whose focus is to ensure optimal performance of the power network within its stability bounds and the other whose thrust is on optimizing the information flow in a communication network. These two networks have contrasting requirements because, on the one hand, time delays are detrimental to the stability and performance of the control system, while on the other hand, allowing higher time delays leads to efficient utilization of the communication network's resources. The proposed framework leads to an optimal compromise between these two noncooperative networks. Three different implementation approaches for the integrated control-communication framework are investigated, namely, centralized, distributed, and clustered. A case illustration of a homogeneous power network is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the joint control-communication framework and compare the performance of the three implementation approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4897610/04752771.pdf","startPage":"1736","endPage":"1745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2012458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2012458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization of Control Performance and Network Resource Utilization in Homogeneous Power Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Communication system control","Communication networks","Delay effects","Stability","Control systems","Power system reliability","Power electronics","Power system dynamics","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","power electronics","power system control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint optimization","control performance","network resource utilization","homogeneous power networks","communication networks","network-controlled interactive power electronics","control stability","Lyapunov stability","network control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interactive power electronic networks (IPNs)","joint optimization","Lyapunov stability","network control systems","network resource utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization of Control Performance and Network Resource Utilization in Homogeneous Power Networks","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4752771/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601712","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization of Control Performance and Network Resource Utilization in Homogeneous Power Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-mazumder-2012458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08235S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4752771","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4752772,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian H.

The proposed strategy is based on the generation of a vector of specific residual using a state observer. The vectorial residual is generated from a decomposition of the current estimation error. This allows for a fast detection of incipient faults, independently of the phase in which the fault occurs. Since the observer includes an adaptive scheme for rotor-speed estimation, the proposed scheme can be implemented for online monitoring, by measuring only stator voltages and currents. It is shown that the proposed strategy presents very low sensitivity to load variations and power-supply perturbations. Experimental results are included to show the ability of the proposed strategy for detecting incipient faults, including a low number of short-circuited turns and low fault current.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5282654/04752772.pdf","startPage":"4671","endPage":"4680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2012468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2012468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Model-Based Stator-Fault Detection and Identification in Induction Motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stators","Induction motors","Induction generators","Observers","Fault detection","Estimation error","Phase detection","Rotors","Monitoring","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","fault diagnosis","induction motors","observers","short-circuit currents","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online model based stator fault detection","fault identification","induction motors","stator interturn short circuit detection","state observer","residual vector","current estimation error","adaptive rotor speed estimation","stator voltage","stator current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detection","identification","induction motors (IMs)","model based","observer","short circuit","stator faults"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Online Model-Based Stator-Fault Detection and Identification in Induction Motors","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4752772/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10916326","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Model-Based Stator-Fault Detection and Identification in Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-deangelo-2012468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070683S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"4752772","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4752775,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4757346/4752775/4752775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuang Sheng (M'99\u2013SM'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1995 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Heriot\u2013Watt University, Edinburgh, U.K., in 1999.","He was a Researcher with Cambridge University, Cambridge, U.K., for three years and is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.

By employing a primary-side energy storage inductor, the main switches can achieve a soft-switching condition, and there is little reverse recovery loss in the body diodes of a secondary-side rectifier due to relatively slow downslope of the triangular current. Since the output capacitive filter reduces the voltage stress across the rectifiers, the synchronous rectifier with a lower breakdown voltage rate can be utilized to improve the conversion efficiency dramatically. Thus, this converter can obtain relatively high conversion efficiency for some medium-power applications with low output voltage and high output current, such as the server adapter. Several key optimum design considerations of this converter are also presented in detail in this paper. Finally, a 100-kHz, 300-W (12 V/25 A) laboratory-made prototype for a given server adapter application is built up based on the proposed optimum design procedure of this converter to verify all the theoretical analysis and evaluations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4752782/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475295","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Design Consideration and Implementation of a Novel Synchronous Rectified Soft-Switched Phase-Shift Full-Bridge Converter for Low-Output-Voltage High-Output-Current Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Design Consideration and Implementation of a Novel Synchronous Rectified Soft-Switched Phase-Shift Full-Bridge Converter for Low-Output-Voltage High-Output-Current Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhao-2005269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129858S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4783511","articleId":"4752782","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4752792,"authors":[{"name":"Ludovic Goux","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4757346/4752792/4752792-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ludovic Goux received the Engineering degree in materials and micro-optoelectronics from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es, Rennes, France, in 1999 and the Ph.D. degree in engineering science from the University of Tours, Tours, France, in 2002.","In 1999, he was a Process Engineer with STMicroelectronics, Tours, focusing on the epitaxial growth of conductive oxides and high-$k$ dielectrics on silicon for application in high capacitances.

The following conclusions were drawn: 1) The reset-switching degradation is closely associated to both an increase of the minimum reset current and a decrease of the obtained reset and set resistances, pointing to material change; 2) the extent of the degradation strongly depends on the reset pulsewidth, and it was found to scale with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tm</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3/2</sup>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tm</i>\n being the melting time during reset pulse; however, higher reset currents did not quicken the onset of degradation; and 3) the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tm</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3/2</sup>\n dependence together with polarity-dependent endurance tests suggests the contribution of an electrical-field-driven migration mechanism.

This paper takes a step toward automating the guidance of a flexible tip-steerable needle as it is inserted into the human tissue. We build upon a previously proposed nonholonomic model of needles that derive steering from asymmetric bevel forces at the tip. The bevel-tip needle is inserted and rotated at its base in order to steer it in 6 DOF. As a first step for control, we show that the needle tip can be automatically guided to a planar slice of the tissue as it is inserted. Our approach keeps the physician in the loop to control insertion speed. The distance of the needle tip position from the plane of interest is used to drive an observer-based feedback controller that we prove is locally asymptotically stable.

After studying the half-bridge structure, two soft-switching dc\u2013dc converters are analyzed: one operating in zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) mode and the other in zero-current-switching (ZCS) mode. The ZVS converter can overcome the drawbacks of the original structure but is more complicated. The ZCS converter cannot operate at duty cycles below 0.5, but is simpler and more suitable for FC applications. Flexible choice of components, low losses, high efficiency, and modular converter possibility are all interesting characteristics of these converters. Their operation principle and characteristics are presented in this paper. Experimental results on 2 kW converters of each structure validate the theoretical analysis. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4785258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.2006553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4785258/04752797.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"210","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.2006553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Half-Bridge Inductive DC\u2013DC Isolated Converters for Fuel Cell Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel Half-Bridge Inductive DC\u2013DC Isolated Converters for Fuel Cell Applications","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4752797/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10475509","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Half-Bridge Inductive DC\u2013DC Isolated Converters for Fuel Cell Applications","sourcePdf":"tec-ensieg-2006553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067833S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4785258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4785258","articleId":"4752797","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":4752799,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Venturino","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automazione, Elettromagnetismo Ingegneria dell'Informazione e Matematica Industriale, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4752799/4752799-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Venturino (S'03\u2013M'06) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy, in 2006.","In 1999 and 2000, he was with the Fermi National Laboratory of Chicago, Chicago, IL, as a summer student.

To thwart 2O-DPA, higher order masking may be employed but it implies a nonnegligible overhead. In this context, there is a need to know how efficient a 2O-DPA can be, in order to evaluate the resistance of an implementation that uses first order masking and, possibly, some hardware countermeasures. Different methods of mounting a practical 2O-DPA attack have been proposed in the literature. However, it is not yet clear which of these methods is the most efficient. In this paper, we give a formal description of the higher order DPA that are mounted against software implementations. We then introduce a framework in which the attack efficiencies may be compared. The attacks we focus on involve the combining of several leakage signals and the computation of correlation coefficients to discriminate the wrong key hypotheses. In the second part of this paper, we pay particular attention to 2O-DPA that involves the product combining or the absolute difference combining. We study them under the assumption that the device leaks the Hamming weight of the processed data together with an independent Gaussian noise. After showing a way to improve the product combining, we argue that in this model, the product combining is more efficient not only than absolute difference combining, but also than all the other combining techniques proposed in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752810/","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4752810/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10601577","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Analysis of Second Order Differential Power Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Analysis of Second Order Differential Power Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttc2009060799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087544S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4877616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"4877616","articleId":"4752810","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4752811,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Cilardo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Cilardo","id":"37300501900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"4752811","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Equations","Hardware","Galois fields","Complexity theory","Elliptic curve cryptography","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-parallel GF multiplier","irreducible pentanomials","bit-parallel multiplication","shifted polynomial bases","SPB product"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GF(2^m) bit-parallel multiplication","shifted polynomial bases","irreducible pentanomials."]}],"abstract":"This work studies efficient bit-parallel multiplication in GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n) for irreducible pentanomials, based on the so-called shifted polynomial bases (SPBs).

It aims at exploiting an underutilized licensed spectrum by enabling opportunistic communications for unlicensed users. In this work, we first develop a distributed cognitive radio MAC (COMAC) protocol that enables unlicensed users to dynamically utilize the spectrum while limiting the interference on primary (PR) users. The main novelty in COMAC lies in not assuming a predefined CR-to-PR power mask and not requiring active coordination with PR users. COMAC provides a statistical performance guarantee for PR users by limiting the fraction of the time during which the PR users' reception is negatively affected by CR transmissions. To provide such a guarantee, we develop probabilistic models for the PR-to-PR and the PR-to-CR interference under a Rayleigh fading channel model. From these models, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of interference. Empirical results show that the distribution of the interference is approximately lognormal. Based on the developed interference models, we derive a closed-form expression for the maximum allowable power for a CR transmission. We extend the min-hop routing to exploit the available channel information for improving the perceived throughput. Our simulation results indicate that COMAC satisfies its target soft guarantees under different traffic loads and arbitrary user deployment scenarios. Results also show that exploiting the available channel information for the routing decisions can improve the end-to-end throughput of the CR network (CRN).","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.19","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5210273/04752837.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC Protocol for Opportunistic Cognitive Radio Networks with Soft Guarantees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"MAC Protocol for Opportunistic Cognitive Radio Networks with Soft Guarantees","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752837/","volume":"8","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4752837/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840272","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC Protocol for Opportunistic Cognitive Radio Networks with Soft Guarantees","sourcePdf":"ttm2009101339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117602S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5210273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5210273","articleId":"4752837","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4752838,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanna Carofiglio","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5166947/4752838/4752838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giovanna Carofiglio received the Dr Ing degree in telecommunication engineering and in electronic and telecommunication engineering, both from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in 2004, and the PhD in telecommunication engineering jointly from Politecnico di Torino and Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France, in 2008.

A method that has been advocated to improve routing efficiency is to select the most stable path so as to reduce the latency and the overhead due to route reconstruction. In this work, we study both the availability and the duration probability of a routing path that is subject to link failures caused by node mobility. In particular, we focus on the case where the network nodes move according to the Random Direction model, and we derive both exact and approximate (but simple) expressions of these probabilities. Through our results, we study the problem of selecting an optimal route in terms of path availability.

It is argued that the two degenerate modes of the empty dual-mode cavity, commonly taken as the vertical and horizontal polarizations, become nonphysical when coupling and tuning elements are inserted. Instead, the original degenerate modes are rotated, or modified in a complex way, to generate two new modes whose characteristics depend on the coupling and tuning elements. It is shown that the tuning elements, as placed in existing dual-mode filter designs, act as both tuning and coupling elements. A working dual-mode filter can be designed with only ldquotuningrdquo elements present. A physical representation of dual-mode filters in terms of the eigenresonances of the dual-mode cavities, with the tuning and coupling elements present, is introduced. Two fourth-order dual-mode rectangular cavity filters with the same response in the passband and its vicinity are also presented to demonstrate the similar role played by ldquotuningrdquo and coupling elements in dual-mode cavities. The first filter uses only ldquotuningrdquo elements, while the second is based only on ldquocouplingrdquo elements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Representation Theory to Dual-Mode Microwave Bandpass Filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2011194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4777655/04752854.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2011194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Application of Representation Theory to Dual-Mode Microwave Bandpass Filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4752854/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10471333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Representation Theory to Dual-Mode Microwave Bandpass Filters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-amari-2011194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061155S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4777655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4777655","articleId":"4752854","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4752855,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander V.

The profiles are reconstructed from measurements of reflection and transmission characteristics obtained with the tested sample at different locations. Operational capabilities of the technique are illustrated through a series of computational experiments for rectangular and cylindrical samples at two (original and 90deg -rotated) positions. The results demonstrate excellent agreement between the reconstructed and actual profiles approximated by linear, quadratic, and Gaussian functions: the average relative errors do not exceed 0.4%, 2.2%, and 4.8%, respectively.

The obtained model is experimentally validated by using a family of 0.25-mum millimeter-wave GaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs through the accurate prediction of critical performance indicators, such as the linear maximum power gain or the stability factor.

The power rating selection is one of the most important design issues for a charge equalizer because it is very closely related to equalization time. To solve this problem optimally, this paper presents a power rating design guide. In addition, this paper considers system-level design issues, such as cell voltage acquisition, equalizer control logic, and system-level grounding. The simulation and experimental results are presented to show the usefulness of the optimal power rating selection guide and the low voltage stressed charge equalization process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modularized Charge Equalizer for an HEV Lithium-Ion Battery String","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2012456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4897610/04752863.pdf","startPage":"1464","endPage":"1476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2012456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4752863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Modularized Charge Equalizer for an HEV Lithium-Ion Battery String","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4752863/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601705","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modularized Charge Equalizer for an HEV Lithium-Ion Battery String","sourcePdf":"tie-moon-2012456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088419S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4752863","onlineDate":"19 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4752988,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Damping and spring forces are calculated both numerically and analytically from the linearized 2D Navier-Stokes equations. In addition to the low frequency region of inertialess gas, where the use of the Reynolds equation is limited, the new model considers several additional phenomena. These are the inertia of the gas, the transition from isothermal to adiabatic conditions, and the gap resonances at frequencies where the acoustic wavelength is comparable to the air gap height. Velocity and temperature slip conditions are considered to make the model valid in micromechanical structures where the air gap heights are of the order of a micrometer. An approximate compact model is derived combining the low frequency model and the gap resonance model. The accuracy of the compact model is studied by comparing its response to the numerical results calculated with the finite element method. The agreement is very good in a wide frequency band when the ratio of the damper width and the gap height is greater than 10. The numerical study and the compact model are directly applicable in predicting the damping and the resonance frequency shift due to air in RF MEMS resonators having narrow air gap widths and operating at frequencies where the wavelengths become comparable to the flow channel dimensions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4752988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4752988/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10399870","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Numerical and compact modelling of squeeze-film damping in RF MEMS resonators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical and compact modelling of squeeze-film damping in RF MEMS resonators","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"SPI-01132009-00057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051542S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731228","isNumber":"4752931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731228","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4752931","articleId":"4752988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TIMA","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4752989,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While acoustic systems are currently the more mature technology, they are ultimately band-limited to sub-MHz type data rates due to the frequency dependent absorption of acoustic energies in water. Advances in fiber optic and free space links have shown promise for optical links to provide data rates in excess of a gigabit per second. It is not surprising then, that laser links are being considered for Naval applications involving high bandwidth communications undersea. A major challenge in implementing optical links underwater arises from the spatial dispersion of photons due to scattering. Spatial spreading of the optical beam reduces the photon density at the receiver position. As such, optical links are only expected to be of greatest utility in links <100 m. Nonetheless, it appears that end users may accept limited link range in exchange for the gain in information bandwidth that optical links may provide. Additionally, researchers continue to study how spatial spreading affects the time encoded portion of the transmitted optical signal. Temporal dispersion arising from multiple scattering events may result in inter-symbol interference (ISI), further limiting link range and/or capacity. Researchers at NAVAIR in Patuxent River MD are currently investigating both the spatial and temporal effects of scattering on a laser link in turbid underwater environments. These links utilize an intensity modulated beam to implement coherent digital modulation schemes such as PSK and QAM. Through both modeling and experiment, the underwater channel is characterized both spatially and temporally. Results are providing insight to system requirements of link range, pointing accuracy, photo-receiver requirements, modulation frequency, and optimal modulation format.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753048","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753048.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial and temporal dispersion in high bandwidth underwater laser communication links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753048/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial and temporal dispersion in high bandwidth underwater laser communication links","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457522","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753048/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial and temporal dispersion in high bandwidth underwater laser communication links","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117037S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4753049,"authors":[{"name":"Santanu Das","affiliation":["Office of Naval Research, Arlington, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Santanu","lastName":"Das","id":"38183851800"},{"name":"Hennes Henniger","affiliation":["Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt Standort Bonn, Bonn, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Hennes","lastName":"Henniger","id":"37542260000"},{"name":"Bernhard Epple","affiliation":[" German Remote Sensing Data Center, Germany AeroSpace Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Epple","id":"37391921300"},{"name":"Christopher I.

These effects can cause short-term outages of a few milliseconds, caused by atmospheric turbulence-induced fading, and long-term outages up to a few seconds duration caused by line of sight obstructions or pointing errors. To mitigate these effects, several different approaches have been presented in the past. At the physical layer, forward-error correction (FEC), dynamic thresholding, and time-delayed diversity (TDD) have been shown to be reasonable solutions. At higher layers, FEC has also been demonstrated to be a possible solution, but it imposes a penalty on channel throughput. For bidirectional communications, automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols are proposed to be a more efficient solution. In this paper we will investigate physical layer delay diversity as well as link layer FEC and ARQ.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753050/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10457524","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A cross-layer approach to mitigate fading on bidirectional free space optical communication links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross-layer approach to mitigate fading on bidirectional free space optical communication links","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043218S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753051,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

Directional RF antennas offer increased capacity over omni-directional antenna networks and some emerging highly-directional networks like free-space optical communication (FSOC) systems will be an important part of future networking infrastructures. The ability to construct and manage an optical network has challenges such as topology control involving the scheduling of pointing, acquisition and tracking events. In many of these directional systems, especially in FSOC where links may be fragile, this will result in an intermittently-connected network, though of tremendous capacity on a per-link basis. This paper establishes delay (or disruption) tolerant networking (DTN) algorithms for such networks and evaluates these new algorithms with mobility, communications constraints, network traffic loads and quality of service (QoS) provisions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753051/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10457525","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"DTN-based free-space optical and directional RF networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DTN-based free-space optical and directional RF networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043204S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4753052,"authors":[{"name":"Kyle Guan","affiliation":["BAE Systems Avionics, Wayne, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kyle","lastName":"Guan","id":"37278542500"},{"name":"Reza Ghanadan","affiliation":["BAE Systems Avionics, Wayne, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Ghanadan","id":"37303752200"},{"name":"Kevin McNeil","affiliation":["BAE Systems Avionics, Wayne, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"McNeil","id":"37661947400"},{"name":"Srikanta Kumar","affiliation":["BAE Systems Avionics, Wayne, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanta","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37068585700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753052","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753052","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Radio frequency","Optical fiber communication","Iterative algorithms","Telecommunication traffic","Algorithm design and analysis","Optical fiber networks","Transceivers","Design optimization","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","integer programming","military communication","optical links","search problems","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network topology","travelling salesman problems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical links","topology formation","tactical networks","directional RF optical links","graph theory","degree-constrained topology optimization","exhaustive search","integer programming","minimum spanning tree","traveling salesman path","network reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space optical (FSO) networks","directional RF transmission","topology control","network throughput","Moore graphs","graph theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753052","endPage":"7","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology formation for tactical networks with directional RF and free-space optical links","abstract":"This work addresses the graph theoretical under-pinning of forming a topology during the deployment of directional RF or free space optical (FSO) based tactical networks. The objective is to construct a topology that not only has a good reliability, but also supports the maximal delivery of traffic. Given the fact that each node has a limited number of transceivers, the design problem falls into the category of (node) degree-constrained topology optimization problem, for which an exhaustive search or integer programming approach becomes prohibitive for larger networks. As such, we focus on first developing a design guideline based on theoretic analysis and then proposing algorithms. The algorithms consist of two components. The first component involves forming a minimum spanning tree (MST) or traveling salesman path (TSP) to guarantee a networkpsilas connectivity. The second component involves iteratively connecting node pairs based on an updated criterion, which takes into considerations of traffic, hop distance, link bandwidth, and network load. Extensive tests demonstrate that the proposed algorithms produce optimal or close-to-optimal solutions. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed algorithms outperform in traffic delivery; while they have similar performance in network reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753052/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753052/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10457526","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Topology formation for tactical networks with directional RF and free-space optical links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology formation for tactical networks with directional RF and free-space optical links","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101387S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753056,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Huntington","affiliation":["Voxtel, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Huntington","id":"37271923400"},{"name":"Madison Compton","affiliation":["Voxtel, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Madison","lastName":"Compton","id":"37662545600"},{"name":"Sam Coykendall","affiliation":["Voxtel, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Coykendall","id":"37662029400"},{"name":"George Soli","affiliation":["Voxtel, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Soli","id":"37653575100"},{"name":"George M.

All optical pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS) generation using both regular and quantum dot (QD) semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) based Mach-Zehnder interferometer have been studied. The speed of operation is limited by the gain and phase recovery times in the SOA. A key element in the fabrication of a PRBS generator is an all optical XOR. All optical XOR functionality has been demonstrated experimentally using regular semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) based Mach-Zehnder interferometer at 80 Gb/s. The performance of the XOR operation has been analyzed by solving the rate equation of the SOA for SOAs with both regular and QD active region. QD-SOAs should result in significantly higher speed operation.

The high peak signal often forces practical amplifiers to operate in the nonlinear region. As a result, it causes additional degradation to the systempsilas performance. Since the frequency bandwidth is a scarce resource, wireless communication systems would have to operate in an environment which is prone to unknown interference such as jamming. In this paper, we analyze the joint effect of nonlinear distortion which is produced by nonlinear high power amplifiers (HPAs) and jammer on the performance of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-OFDM system in Rayleigh fading channels. In addition, we extend on our previous work to include the situations where there is a frequency offset between jammer and desired signal. For the purpose of simulation, we extend the analytical model to be in compliance with the IEEE 802.11n standard.

OFDM technique is already widely used in broadband communications; however it is shown that system architecture based on this method of data coding and modulation can also be used in radar with minimum modifications. Indeed, modeling study shows that OFDM radar signals perform well in presence of jamming and interference and possess noise-like qualities making them good candidates for low probability of detect/intercept (LPI/LPD) system implementation. The system concept and design are discussed and LPI/LPD features of OFDM signals are illustrated via spectrogram.

Both time and frequency-based polarimetric sensing strategies are considered. The time-based detection statistic is formed using the differential time-averaged received signal polarization state. This approach suffers from the impact of polarization-sensitive channel impairments, especially polarization mode dispersion (PMD). As PMD effects become more prominent, the variability of the time-domain signal polarization increases and the average polarization over a detection interval may be substantially different from the instantaneous signal polarization states, detracting from the overall sensitivity of the detection statistic. Frequency-domain approaches, on the other hand, can leverage the relatively stable polarization-frequency signature of the received signal, and can be designed to easily exploit PMD using differential detection in the subbands. Integration of the detections over the full complement of subbands is then used to arrive at a final detection statistic. Using indoor measurements, the resulting subbanded architecture is found to provide improved detection sensitivity in comparison to the time-based version as well as to more conventional power-based techniques, including a subbanded power-based architecture.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753072","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753072.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-polarized architectures for sensing with wireless communications signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753072/","displayDocTitle":"Dual-polarized architectures for sensing with wireless communications signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10465955","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753072/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-polarized architectures for sensing with wireless communications signals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055052S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753076,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Wei Chang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Wireless Systems and Applications and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Che-Wei","lastName":"Chang","id":"38253083500"},{"name":"Akshay Kothari","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Wireless Systems and Applications and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Akshay","lastName":"Kothari","id":"38254417400"},{"name":"Ali Jafri","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Wireless Systems and Applications and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Jafri","id":"38253494700"},{"name":"Dimitrios Koutsonikolas","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Wireless Systems and Applications and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Koutsonikolas","id":"37317943800"},{"name":"Dimitrios Peroulis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Wireless Systems and Applications and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Peroulis","id":"37275343300"},{"name":"Y.

In collaborative beamforming, the antennas of the sensor nodes form a distributed antenna array in an effort to direct the radiated energy to the desired direction and thus increase the overall power efficiency of the network. Existing studies, however, have not addressed several major design issues: how to (1) optimally select a subset of radiating sensors for a given receiver to obtain optimal beamforming performance, (2) alternate among subsets of radiating sensors to prolong the lifetime of the sensors and robustness of network connection to the receiver, and (3) do so in the presence of synchronization and localization uncertainties. In this paper, we first define the problem of selecting the subset of sensors that achieve optimal beamforming performance. We then propose a heuristic algorithm with complexity O(M log M), where M is the total number of distributed sensors, that simultaneously addresses the above three issues. In particular, we demonstrate its effectiveness in realistic scenarios with synchronization and localization errors. Further, we show that real-time grouping can be achieved even when thousands of sensors are spread over large distances of over 1000 wavelengths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753076/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10457547","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753076/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Radiating sensor selection for distributed beamforming in wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiating sensor selection for distributed beamforming in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104005S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753094,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantin N.

The low cost and simple implementation of digital predistortion has made it a highly desirable alternative to expensive and power hungry RF linearizers. A digital predistorter scales and rotates the input samples based on the samplespsila magnitude. The adjustment coefficient depends on the amplifier nonlinearity. These coefficients can be obtained directly by measuring the amplifier characteristics with a network analyzer. The coefficients can also be arrived at by adaptively adjusting an initial estimate such that an error metric is minimized. The error metric is typically the difference between the transmitted and the received samples. The adaptation is accomplished using a standard gradient descent algorithm such as least mean squares (LMS). In this paper we present measurement results comparing the two approaches. The measurements were performed for a space-qualified traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA). We show that the adaptive approach provides better frequency domain performance (shoulder reduction). However, the improvement in signal to noise ratio and bit error rate is almost identical for the two approaches.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Predistortion","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Nonlinear distortion","High power amplifiers","Costs","Least squares approximation","Performance evaluation","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","gradient methods","least mean squares methods","network analysers","power amplifiers","travelling wave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier digital predistortion","RF linearization","high-power amplifiers","power-efficient saturation point","amplifier nonlinearity","network analyzer","gradient descent algorithm","least mean squares","space-qualified traveling wave tube amplifier","frequency domain performance","shoulder reduction","bit error rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753094","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753094.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power amplifier digital predistortion - fixed or adaptive?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power amplifier digital predistortion - fixed or adaptive?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753094/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753094/","accessionNumber":"10465961","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power amplifier digital predistortion - fixed or adaptive?","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057487S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4753106,"authors":[{"name":"Navneet Agrawal","affiliation":["Deptt.

It is proposed to first pre-process the raw data and then to apply a suitable compression technique like back-propagation neural network whose on-board implementation would be efficient both in terms of speed and power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753106/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10457570","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753106/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Back propagation neural network approach for SAR raw data compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back propagation neural network approach for SAR raw data compression","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058459S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4753149,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh S.

Although, optical fiber can transfer data at the rate of 1.6 Terabit/s per fiber - using Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technologies - the need for pre-laid infrastructure (optical fiber, network elements and significant network management) makes it more suitable for intercontinental backbones. Although Free Space Optical Communications (FSO) provides significant advantages for communication at the extremities of the network, the requirements of cloud-free line-of-sight (CFLOS) and perfect weather conditions prevent FSO alone from being a reliable military communications system. Hence, a hybrid system with FSO as the primary choice and RF as a fallback option has been proposed.

To facilitate the development of signaling strategies and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system architectures, many different channel modeling strategies have been employed. When it is desirable to create many different channel matrix realizations for a variety of environments, analytical models are typically used. One of the most popular analytical models, the Kronecker model, has been shown to be deficient in its representation of the channel. An alternate model, proposed by Weichselberger, has been shown to provide a better match than the Kronecker model in predicting a variety of channel metrics. As in the Kronecker case, this model requires knowledge of the link end correlation matrices. However, it also requires the additional knowledge of a power coupling matrix. In this paper, we use beamforming techniques to understand how the environment is represented in the Weichselberger channel model using measured MIMO channel matrices. We examine the model underpinnings and how the component parts capture the physics of the environment. Additionally, synthesized data is used to further examine the properties of the model's power coupling matrix.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753159","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753159.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Weichselberger model: A detailed investigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753159/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Weichselberger model: A detailed investigation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457599","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753159/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Weichselberger model: A detailed investigation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048546S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753187,"authors":[{"name":"Adem Orsdemir","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Adem","lastName":"Orsdemir","id":"38557389700"},{"name":"H.

Reconstruction of the signal from the CS measurements relies on the knowledge of the measurement matrix used for sensing. Generation of the pseudo-random sensing matrix utilizing a cryptographic key, offers a natural method for encrypting the signal during CS. This CS based encryption has the inherent advantage that encryption occurs implicitly in the sensing process - without requiring additional computation. Additionally, the robustness of recovery from compressed sensing, allows a new form of ldquorobust encryptionrdquo for multimedia data, wherein the signal is recoverable with high fidelity despite the introduction of additive noise in the encrypted data. In this paper, we examine the security and robustness of this CS based encryption method. The security implications are investigated by considering brute force and structured attacks. Robustness is characterized empirically. Our analysis and results indicate that the computational complexity of these attacks renders them infeasible in practice. In addition, the CS based encryption is found to have fair robustness against additive noise, making it a promising ldquorobust encryptionrdquo technique for multimedia.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753187","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753187.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the security and robustness of encryption via compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753187/","displayDocTitle":"On the security and robustness of encryption via compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457604","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753187/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the security and robustness of encryption via compressed sensing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056735S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753199,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna K.

STBC-OFDM and SFBC-OFDM undergo severe performance degradation in time-varying and frequency-selective channel, respectively. In the adaptive scheme, either STBC-OFDM or SFBC-OFDM is selected by using the proposed switching criteria. Two selection criteria, correlation of the channel and magnitude of the interference, are proposed for transmission mode selection. In criterion I, based on the observation of the theoretical performance in (D.B. lin et al., 2005), correlation between successive OFDM symbols for STBC-OFDM and correlation between neighboring subcarriers for SFBC-OFDM are compared and the mode which has higher correlation value is selected to maximize the SNR. Next, in criterion II, we choose the mode which has smaller interference to reduce the performance degradation due to the interference. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive switching system outperforms the nonadaptive system.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753221","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753221.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive switching between space-time and space-frequency block coded OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753221/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive switching between space-time and space-frequency block coded OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466041","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753221/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive switching between space-time and space-frequency block coded OFDM systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050304S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753223,"authors":[{"name":"Mingzheng Cao","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, Department of ECE, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Mingzheng Cao","id":"37281001100"},{"name":"Hongya Ge","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, Department of ECE, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Hongya Ge","id":"37285019800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753223","dbTime":"48 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transceivers","Maximum likelihood decoding","Transmitters","Parameter estimation","Baseband","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Signal processing","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO STBC communication system","multiple-input multiple-output sustem","space-time block codes","in-phase/quadrature imbalance","orthogonal STBC system","quasi orthogonal STBC system","distortion"]}],"abstract":"In this work we study the performance degradation caused by the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance of the transceivers in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) space-time block coded (STBC) communication systems.

In the proposed receiver, two types of diversities are considered; the path, and spatial diversities. A closed form one-fold integration, which could be solved numerically without the need for simulations, is derived for the BER performance of the system.

The modified decoder erases codewords detected during iterations that fall outside a maximum decoding angle with respect to the received observation. The new algorithm is applicable in scenarios that demand a very low undetected error rate but require short LDPC codes that are too vulnerable to undetected errors when the usual iterative decoding algorithm is used. BA-I decoding provides a means of reducing the maximum undetected error rate for short LDPC codes significantly, by incorporating a simple extra condition into the iterative decoder structure without redesigning the code. The reduction in undetected error rate comes at a price of increasing the threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for achieving a good overall error rate, but this increase in channel threshold can be minimized by allowing the decoderpsilas maximum decoding angle to vary with SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753226/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10466046","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753226/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bounded angle iterative decoding of LDPC codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded angle iterative decoding of LDPC codes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060124S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753227,"authors":[{"name":"Michael B.

CPM waveforms such as shaped-offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK) and pulse code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM), which are currently used in military satellite and aeronautical telemetry standards, can be viewed as inner codes due to their recursive nature. For the outer codes, we apply turbo-product codes (TPC) and serially concatenated convolutional codes (SCCC) because of their large coding gains, high coding rates, and because their decoding algorithms are readily implemented. High-rate codes are of special interest in aeronautical telemetry applications due to recent reductions in available spectrum and ever-increasing demands on data rates. We evaluate the proposed coding schemes with a large set of numerical simulation results and make a number of recommendations based on these results.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753228.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Serially concatenated codes for aeronautical telemetry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Telemetry","Frequency modulation","Iterative decoding","Pulse modulation","Continuous phase modulation","Iterative algorithms","Quadrature phase shift keying","Pulse shaping methods","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","continuous phase modulation","iterative decoding","pulse code modulation","pulse frequency modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","telemetry","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serially concatenated codes","aeronautical telemetry","bandwidth-efficient serially concatenated coded continuous phase modulation","iterative decoding algorithms","shaped-offset quadrature phase shift keying","pulse code modulation","turbo-product codes","pulse frequency modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Serially concatenated codes for aeronautical telemetry","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753228/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466048","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Serially concatenated codes for aeronautical telemetry","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114701S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753229,"authors":[{"name":"Chad A.

While simulations are normally done with floating point computation, any practical implementation (ASIC or FPGA) will be built with fixed-point computation. Obviously, decoder speed will increase, and resource requirements will drop, with low-precision implementations, say 3,4, or 5-bit architectures. In this paper we study the effects of quantization in this regime, using density evolution and decoder simulation. Detailed sum-product decoder implementations are given, and performance losses relative to floating point decoding are given. In particular, 4-bit decoder architectures sustain only 0.1 dB penalty.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753231.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient quantization schemes for LDPC decoders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Parity check codes","Sparse matrices","Iterative decoding","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Visualization","Cities and towns","Throughput","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient quantization schemes","LDPC decoders","LDPC codes","near-capacity performance","parallel decoding architectures","ASIC","FPGA","fixed-point computation","density evolution","sum-product decoder","floating point decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient quantization schemes for LDPC decoders","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753231/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466051","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient quantization schemes for LDPC decoders","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041775S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4753232,"authors":[{"name":"JaWone Kennedy","affiliation":["Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 305 Fluor Daniel Engineering Innovation Building, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"JaWone","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37653378900"},{"name":"Daniel L.

We describe and evaluate an adaptive scaling metric for soft-decision decoding in direct-sequence spread-spectrum receivers for tactical radio networks. The metric is derived from post-detection signal quality statistics that are developed in the demodulator, and it is applied to the demodulatorpsilas soft-decision outputs before they are sent to the decoder. To maintain efficient use of assigned channel and spectrum resources, our metric exploits the nature of the spread-spectrum signal to obtain demodulator statistics during the reception of the desired transmission and therefore requires no pilot symbols or channel measurements. We compare the performance of our proposed adaptive scaling metric with a fixed soft-decision metric and with the log-likelihood ratio metric.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753233","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753233.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A soft-decision scaling metric employing receiver statistics for direct-sequence spread-spectrum packet radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A soft-decision scaling metric employing receiver statistics for direct-sequence spread-spectrum packet radio networks","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466053","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A soft-decision scaling metric employing receiver statistics for direct-sequence spread-spectrum packet radio networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0587S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753240,"authors":[{"name":"Yefim Poberezhskiy","affiliation":["SAIC, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yefim","lastName":"Poberezhskiy","id":"37271515600"},{"name":"Dennis Braunreiter","affiliation":["SAIC, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Braunreiter","id":"37078674100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753240","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Filtering","Dynamic range","Baseband","Band pass filters","Bandwidth","Jamming","Frequency conversion","Radio frequency","Adaptive arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antialiasing","band-pass filters","radio receivers","sampling methods","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal antialiasing filtering","software defined receivers","bandpass sampling","antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753240","abstract":"Although bandpass sampling potentially provides higher performance of SDRs than the baseband one, conventional technique does not allow realizing all its advantages.

The method presented in this paper is based on joint processing of M signal samples and uses the effect of reduction of each sample contribution to the quantization errors of algebraic sums of these samples when the individual samples and the sums are quantized by A/Ds with the same quantization steps. To utilize this effect, only the least significant bits (LSBs) of the quantized samples and the corresponding portions of the samplespsila analog values are summed so that the sums are components of the Walsh spectrum of the processed sequence of samples.

Even though asynchronous wise both applications are same, they are not when the number of sources are considered. This paper considers the problem of estimating the DOA of users in an asynchronous DS-CDMA system where the technique is not constrained by the number of users in the system. Consequently in this work we do not assume multiple-access-interference (MAI) to be Gaussian distributed as the number of sources could be limited. In the proposed technique, explicit modeling of an asynchronous DS-CDMA system is done. Here we use a combined statistical and neural network (NN) approach to suppress the interference and noise. When selecting the input vector we adhere to our own technique which reduces the noise component largely and the size of the vector is smaller compared to some other techniques. NN training is used to mitigate the interference. To see how volatile the estimations in the variation of MAI component, we consider the worst case scenario and find a closed form expression for the maximum number of users that it can handle as interferes. Simulations under different environments are presented to verify the theoretical results. This technique shows highly accurate estimations as a result of being able to eliminate noise by the specific selection of input vectors and mitigate MAI via training. Even in the cases of limited number of users (as an example military related applications), where Gaussian distributed MAI approximation might not hold, this approach shows highly accurate estimations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction of Arrival estimation of asynchronous DS-CDMA systems using a neural network approach","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753250","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753250.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Direction of Arrival estimation of asynchronous DS-CDMA systems using a neural network approach","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753250/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466070","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction of Arrival estimation of asynchronous DS-CDMA systems using a neural network approach","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048182S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4753252,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro A.

This paper proposes a vertical-Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) architecture with non-stationary interference avoidance capability. A transform domain processing (TDP) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector are combined with the V-BLAST to enhance performance in a narrow band interference (NBI) environment. A key idea of TDP is to generate an adaptive modulated information-bearing signal avoiding spectrally crowded regions in the transform domain at both transmitters and receivers of the V-BLAST system. The adaptive interference-free signal is synthesized by a non-parametric spectral estimator, called Caponpsilas method (CM). The proposed V-BLAST system also incorporates the MMSE detector. These approaches offer better bit error performance than other interference mitigation methodologies that process signals at the receiver only, and better than other similar systems that use a parametric spectral estimator with zero-forcing detector. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed system mitigates not only stationary interferences but also non-stationary interferences.

When spectral nulls are present in the channel, they can severely degrade or cancel out OFDM tones, resulting in an irreducible error rate. To combat this, standards typically employ forward error correction (FEC) techniques. Code-Spread OFDM (CS-OFDM) combines the characteristics of OFDM and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) to create a more robust modulation scheme which provides substantial performance improvements relative to standard OFDM. In CS-OFDM, each sinewave carries a weighted sum of all the information symbols being transmitted in an OFDM block interval. In this paper, the MMSE estimator is derived for each symbol for a number of cases, including when the number of carriers is greater than the number of symbols. The performance of both OFDM and CS-OFDM are evaluated with and without error control coding using the FEC techniques typically employed in OFDM standards.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of Code-Spread OFDM with error control coding","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753261","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753261.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of Code-Spread OFDM with error control coding","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753261/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466081","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of Code-Spread OFDM with error control coding","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06528S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753264,"authors":[{"name":"Don Torrieri","affiliation":["US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Torrieri","id":"37300038300"},{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"Hyuck M.

An expectation-maximization channel-estimation algorithm for the fading amplitude and interference-plus-noise power spectral density (PSD) is proposed for CDMA systems with low-density parity-check codes. The elimination of pilot symbols simplifies the system design and allows either an enhancement in information throughput or greater spectral efficiency by increasing the information-symbol duration. After initial estimates of the fading amplitude and noise PSD are obtained from the received symbols, subsequent values of these parameters are iteratively updated by using the soft feedback from the channel decoder. The updated estimates are combined with the received symbols and iteratively passed to the decoder. Although the bit error rates of the proposed systems may be slightly larger than those of comparable systems with pilot-assisted channel estimation, the throughputs are higher.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753265.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doubly iterative LDPC-coded DS-CDMA receivers with coherent detection, EM channel estimation, and no pilot symbols","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Channel estimation","Iterative decoding","Fading","Throughput","Modulation coding","Demodulation","Iterative algorithms","Interference","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","code division multiple access","demodulation","error statistics","expectation-maximisation algorithm","fading channels","iterative decoding","modulation coding","parity check codes","radio receivers","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly iterative LDPC-coded DS-CDMA receiver","coherent detection","EM channel estimation algorithm","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access system","M-ary modulation","iterative decoding","expectation-maximization channel-estimation algorithm","fading amplitude","interference-plus-noise power spectral density","low-density parity-check code","soft feedback","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Doubly iterative LDPC-coded DS-CDMA receivers with coherent detection, EM channel estimation, and no pilot symbols","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753265/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466084","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doubly iterative LDPC-coded DS-CDMA receivers with coherent detection, EM channel estimation, and no pilot symbols","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085627S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753267,"authors":[{"name":"Prashanth Chandran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Prashanth","lastName":"Chandran","id":"37627753800"},{"name":"Erik Perrins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Perrins","id":"37280229000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753267","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Detectors","Quantization","Continuous phase modulation","Performance loss","Transmitters","Military standards","Computer science","Phase shift keying","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","continuous phase modulation","error statistics","quadrature phase shift keying","quantisation (signal)","signal detection","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOQPSK","symbol timing recovery","shaped-offset quadrature phase-shift keying","bandwidth-efficient modulation","constant-envelope modulation","continuous phase modulation","CPM","constrained ternary data alphabet","blind timing error detector","quantization","S-curve","noncoherent detection scheme","false lock detector"]}],"abstract":"We consider symbol timing recovery for shaped-offset quadrature phase-shift keying (SOQPSK), a highly bandwidth-efficient and popular constant-envelope modulation scheme. The proposed timing recovery method makes use of a recent continuous phase modulation (CPM) interpretation of SOQPSK, where SOQPSK is viewed as a CPM with a constrained (correlated) ternary data alphabet. We derive a timing error detector (TED) that is an extended version of a non-data-aided (blind) TED for CPM, where the proposed extensions take the data correlation of SOQPSK explicitly into account. The merits of the modified TED are demonstrated by comparing its performance with and without taking the data correlation into account. As a further modification, we show that a quantization scheme can be used to yield an extremely low-complexity version of the system with only negligible performance losses. The S-curve of the proposed quantized TED is given, which rules out the existence of false lock points. Numerical performance results are given for the most popular SOQPSK variant: MIL-STD SOQPSK. These results show that the proposed scheme has great promise in a wide range of applications due to its low complexity, its lack of false lock points, and its blind nature; such applications include timing recovery in noncoherent detection schemes and false lock detectors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple timing recovery scheme for SOQPSK","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753267","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753267.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A simple timing recovery scheme for SOQPSK","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753267/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466086","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple timing recovery scheme for SOQPSK","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063364S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753269,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Zhenyu Liang","id":"37399060900"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yong Huat Chew","id":"37280653600"},{"name":"Chi Chung Ko","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Chi Chung Ko","id":"37279881600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753269","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"abstract":"This paper addresses the adaptive allocation of subcarrier, bit and power resources in the downlink of multicell OFDMA systems, where base stations allocate radio resources in a decentralized manner. Our algorithm uses discrete bit-loading values which is more applicable to the practical systems. Noncooperative game theoretic approach is adopted and we first only include the transmit power and throughput in the payoff function of each base station. Using the optimal solutions as the benchmark, the performance of this noncooperative game is obtained through computer simulations. Our simulation results show that in the multicell OFDMA systems with frequency reuse factor of one, such payoff function provides inadequate utilization efficiency due to the presence of high co-channel interference. We next incorporate the number of allocated subcarriers in the payoff function of each base station. We show that the new payoff function avoid neighboring base station from transmitting using the same subcarrier when interference is large. This resembles the use of interference avoidance technique in the algorithm, and can achieve better resource utilization when compared to the water-filling counterpart.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753269.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized bit, subcarrier and power allocation with interference avoidance in multicell OFDMA systems using game theoretic approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Resource management","Base stations","Interchannel interference","Power engineering and energy","Downlink","Throughput","Computer simulation","Computational modeling","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","game theory","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized bit allocation","subcarrier allocation","power allocation","interference avoidance","multicell OFDMA system","radio resource allocation","noncooperative game theoretic approach","frequency reuse factor","payoff function","cochannel interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized bit, subcarrier and power allocation with interference avoidance in multicell OFDMA systems using game theoretic approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753269/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466088","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized bit, subcarrier and power allocation with interference avoidance in multicell OFDMA systems using game theoretic approach","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072461S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4753270,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Pladdy","affiliation":["MITRE Corporation, Leavenworth, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Pladdy","id":"37564323800"},{"name":"Robert M.

We consider the situation where User 2psilas packet arrives initially and we are able to estimate accurately this userpsilas channel impulse response. Then a packet from User 1 arrives during the data portion of User 2psilas packet. We propose an algorithm for simultaneously estimating the channel impulse response (CIR) of User 2 and detecting the data of User 1, i.e. joint data detection and channel estimation for two dominant users in the asynchronous scalar Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC) with complex-valued intersymbol interference (ISI). This approach proves to be useful for reestimation of User 2psilas CIR, after cancellation of interference from User 1. We demonstrate the algorithm with simulation results. We give an extension of the algorithm where the estimate of User 1psilas data is used for interference cancellation to refine the estimate of User 2psilas channel. In simulations, this is shown to improve the channel estimate. We also give reduced rank approximations of the algorithm, using the conjugate gradient method, which are more suited to real time applications and which implement noise-reduction for an over-modeled system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753270.pdf","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for two dominant users in the asynchronous GMAC with memory","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753270","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for two dominant users in the asynchronous GMAC with memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753270/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10466089","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753270/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for two dominant users in the asynchronous GMAC with memory","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095383S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4753271,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Moazzami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Moazzami","id":"38277464400"},{"name":"Arlene Cole-Rhodes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Arlene","lastName":"Cole-Rhodes","id":"38274141700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753271","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Source separation","MIMO","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Cost function","Adaptive equalizers","Collaboration","Government","Convergence","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive blind equalizer","signal separation","MIMO system","QAM signals","multiple-input multiple-output equalization scheme","CMA-AMA equalizer","constant modulus algorithm","alphabet-matched algorithm cost functions","channel estimator","mean square error","symbol error rates","single-input single-output system","single-input multiple-output systems","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind Equalizers","Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA)","Alphabet-matched Algorithm (AMA)","MIMO Systems","QAM Signals","Channel Estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this work we propose a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) equalization scheme which uses the CMA+AMA equalizer in a modified multi-stage approach that simultaneously recovers all signal sources.

The MIMO equalizer applies individual multiple-input single-output (MISO) equalizers to the received data stream, which is modified during the update process, to simultaneously remove the recovered sources using a channel estimator.

An analytical expression of the ambiguity function for weighted pulse trains with Oppermann sequences is derived. Given a family of Oppermann sequences, it is shown that the related ambiguity function depends only on one sequence parameter. This property simplifies the design of the associated weighted pulse trains as it constrains the degrees of freedom. In contrast to the single polyphase pulse compression sequences that are typically deployed in radar applications, the families considered in this paper form sets of sequences.

We constrained both multi-carrier schemes to the same bandwidth, information rate, and energy-per-bit, which resulted in a possible trade-off between diversity gain and channel estimation errors between the two schemes. In this paper, we incorporate spatial diversity into the comparison by considering a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing Alamouti space-time block coding at each sub-carrier frequency. Since we only examine those cases where MC-CDMA has higher frequency diversity than MC-DS-CDMA, and since increases in diversity yield diminishing gains, the additional diversity benefits MC-DS-CDMA more than MCCDMA. To determine whether these gains for MC-DSCDMA are enough to offset the difference in frequency diversity between the two schemes, we derive closed-form expressions for the bit error probabilities of both schemes, and we compare the MIMO results against those of the SISO system for different information rates, number of users, and number of pilot symbols per channel estimate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of spatial diversity and imperfect channel estimation on multi-carrier CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753280","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753280.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"The effects of spatial diversity and imperfect channel estimation on multi-carrier CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753280/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466096","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of spatial diversity and imperfect channel estimation on multi-carrier CDMA systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126494S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753281,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqiang Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"lastName":"Jianqiang Zeng","id":"37400498500"},{"name":"Hlaing Minn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Hlaing","lastName":"Minn","id":"37269620000"},{"name":"Lakshman S.

The two systems have a very similar spectrum property: each userpsilas signal is spread over one part of the whole bandwidth, so they can obtain the same frequency diversity gain and have similar BER performances. However, the direct spreading is applied in time domain for CS-CDMA and frequency domain for MC-CDMA.

Although the pilot signal and traffic channels are designed to be transmitted using orthogonal codes in the downlink direction, time dispersion and frequency-selective fading in the transmission channel severely degrade this orthogonality at the receiver. As a result, the traffic signal of a target base station appears as interference coming from the same direction as the pilot signal, and causes poor performance of a pilot-only training-based beamformer. In order to mitigate this effect, we propose a semiblind beamforming algorithm that jointly exploits the pilot signal and the traffic channel signals. A modified version of the semiblind beamformer simultaneously suppresses self-interference and cochannel interference from other base stations. The proposed semiblind techniques outperform the conventional pilot-only approach as demonstrated via computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753285.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A semiblind adaptive beamformer using a parallel pilot signal for WCDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Adaptive algorithm","Wideband","Signal design","Downlink","Frequency","Fading","Degradation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadband networks","code division multiple access","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiblind adaptive beamformer","parallel pilot signal","WCDMA systems","wideband code-division multiple-access","traffic channels","traffic signal","interference","self-interference","cochannel interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A semiblind adaptive beamformer using a parallel pilot signal for WCDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753285/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10477858","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A semiblind adaptive beamformer using a parallel pilot signal for WCDMA systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047298S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753287,"authors":[{"name":"Ahsen U.

However, in CE-OFDM, the data symbols are no longer confined to orthogonal subcarriers and, therefore, an equalizer is required for operation in frequency selective channels. A frequency domain equalizer (FDE) is known to perform well for OFDM as well as CE-OFDM [3]. In this paper, we study the performance of CE-OFDM in multipath fading channels while employing a FDE. The quality of the channel estimate which is obtained using a training signal directly affects the performance of the equalizer. We investigate channel estimation using both the least squares (LS) as well as the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) techniques and compare the equalizer performance for both these cases. It is desirable to have a training signal that has a low PAPR in time domain while also having a flat power spectrum in the frequency domain.

It is used in many wireless communication systems due to its robustness towards fading channel behavior and a relative ease of implementation coming from computationally efficient Inverse Fast Fourier Transforms (IFFT) on the transmitter and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the receiver. However, the OFDM waveform has a large Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). To avoid clipping and nonlinear distortion, the transmitter's Power Amplifier (PA) needs to be operated at a significantly lower power level than its peak rating (i.e. \"backed off\"). This paper proposes a novel low PAPR preamble for channel estimation. This solution yields a preamble with PAPR of approximately 2.6 dB, regardless of the number of subcarriers. The subcarriers are evenly spaced and equal amplitude, ideal for channel sounding. The result is a preamble construction that operates over a variable number of subcarriers, improves SNR, and is easy to implement. The theoretical basis for the technique is presented, and a particular implementation of the technique in FPGA hardware is discussed. Both simulations and measurements demonstrate significant benefits of the proposed technique in long-range wireless communications applications that use an OFDM waveform.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753288.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753288","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753288","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Channel estimation","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Fast Fourier transforms","Transmitters","Frequency conversion","Frequency modulation","Robustness","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division modulation","inverse fast Fourier transforms","fading channel","peak-to-average power ratio","power amplifier","channel sounding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753288/","displayDocTitle":"Low PAPR preamble for improved channel estimation","accessionNumber":"10466102","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753288/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low PAPR preamble for improved channel estimation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05741S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753289,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Heon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Heon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37656821900"},{"name":"Suk Chan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suk Chan","lastName":"Kim","id":"38189668200"},{"name":"Jin Woo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Woo","lastName":"Park","id":"37657198500"},{"name":"Seong Lai Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Lai","lastName":"Park","id":"38255670400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753289","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a channel estimation method which uses piecewise linear interpolation with wavelet de-noising to reduce additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and intercarrier interference (ICI) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) mobile communication systems.

The reduction in SINR requirement due to spreading gain provides attractive robustness against aggregate interference of more distant interferers.

An alternative to scheduling is to employ interference-aware receivers that exploit information in the interfering signal with the goal of negating its effect on the desired transmission. In this paper interference supersession using MAC scheduling is compared with interference cancelation by employing successive interference cancelation (SIC). The results show that under strict outage constraint, inhibiting nearby nodes through scheduling is a better option than to employ SIC with imperfect channel estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10466107","htmlLink":"/document/4753293/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Interference cancelation vs. interference suppression in ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference cancelation vs. interference suppression in ad hoc networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094097S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753294,"authors":[{"name":"Brett T.

In a wireless experiment, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals are transmitted from a slant-45deg polarized antenna and received with a dual-polarized antenna.

There exists a smart jammer which is capable of intercepting the feedback channel message such that channel state information (CSI) measured and sent back by a receiver can be perfectly known to the jammer, as well. We formulate a novel two-layer two-person zero-sum game. Under this zero-sum game framework, the following three fundamental questions are addressed. The first one is about whether to hop or to spread power over M frequency bands given the full CSI at both transmitter and jammer sides. We prove that spreading versus spreading is the Nash equilibrium point. The second question is about the impact of sending back CSI on the overall throughput, to feedback or not to feedback, considering the presence of a smart jammer capable to exploit CSI for its malicious purpose. We show that possessing the full CSI enables a better means to defend against the jammerpsilas attacks. The last question is about whether the amount of feedback information can be reduced given the mutual restrictions between transmitter and jammer. We prove that the receiver should also get involved by adaptively sending CSI without compromising the sum rate at the equilibrium point.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753295.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jamming and counter-measure strategies in parallel Gaussian fading channels with channel state information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753295/","displayDocTitle":"Jamming and counter-measure strategies in parallel Gaussian fading channels with channel state information","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466109","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming and counter-measure strategies in parallel Gaussian fading channels with channel state information","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060262S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753296,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Batra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Batra","id":"37624313100"},{"name":"James R.

The prediction-error filter (PEF) is introduced as a means for mitigating the NBI in the time-domain prior to demodulation. In the uncoded case, the PEF is shown to mitigate the interference, however, the performance is limited by an irreducible error floor due to the data subcarriers that are notched out. In the coded case, the coding provides a way for recovering the removed subcarriers. The PEF is compared with Bayesian erasure insertion over a range of SIRs and it is seen that the PEF performs best for all SIRs.

In the United States (US) these techniques are being considered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for communications services in unlicensed VHF and UHF TV bands. Similar consideration is being given elsewhere in the world such as with Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the United Kingdom. Standardization is at the core of cognitive radiopsilas current and future successes.

MHPSK is a spectrally efficient modulation technique that uses four orthonormal basis functions to increase the distance between different symbols in the signal space. Spectral efficiency and probability of bit error are two key figures of merit used to evaluate digital modulation techniques. The use of four orthonormal basis functions provides an advantage over traditional modulation techniques such as M-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude keying (MQAM) that only possess two degrees of freedom. MHPSK offers an improvement in bit error performance over other spectrally efficient modulation techniques for the same average energy per bit-to-noise power spectral density ratio and similar spectral efficiency. As a result, MHPSK offers a novel way to improve both throughput and reduce power requirements using easy to generate waveforms. In this paper, Reed Solomon coded symbols are assumed to be transmitted with MHPSK. MHPSK, MPSK, and MQAM are compared in terms of probability of bit error and bandwidth efficiency, where the number of bits per coded symbol are typically designed to match the number of bits per channel symbol.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753300.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reed Solomon coded M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","Phase shift keying","Forward error correction","Robustness","Satellite communication","Digital modulation","Phase modulation","Amplitude modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error statistics","forward error correction","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Reed-Solomon codes","satellite links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","forward error correction coding","satellite communication uplink robustness","orthonormal basis functions","bit error probability","spectral efficiency","digital modulation techniques","M-ary quadrature amplitude keying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectral efficiency","orthonormal","phase shift-keying","probability of bit error","forward error correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reed Solomon coded M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466114","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reed Solomon coded M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08174S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4753301,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo M.

We investigate how the number of available transmission rates in the ACM scheme impacts communication performance and feedback requirements. To accommodate for the various rates in the ACM system we use serial concatenated trellis-coded modulation (SCTCM) consisting of a rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) code or a woven serial concatenated convolutional (WSCC) code, both with a rate-1 inner accumulate code and mapping to a Gray-labeled signal constellation. We show that significant reductions in complexity and corresponding savings in protocol overhead can be obtained without significant performance degradation. It is shown that an equal spacing of available rates over the expected range of SNRs is preferable to an uneven spacing.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753301.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-complexity Woven Serial Concatenated TCM for tactical OFDM communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Modulation coding","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Adaptive coding","OFDM modulation","Feedback","Signal mapping","Constellation diagram","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","concatenated codes","convolutional codes","feedback","military communication","OFDM modulation","protocols","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-complexity woven serial concatenated TCM","tactical OFDM communications","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","adaptive coding","adaptive modulation","signal-to-noise ratios","feedback requirements","serial concatenated trellis-coded modulation","rate-compatible punctured convolutional code","woven serial concatenated convolutional code","Gray-labeled signal constellation","protocol overhead"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-complexity Woven Serial Concatenated TCM for tactical OFDM communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753301/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466115","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-complexity Woven Serial Concatenated TCM for tactical OFDM communications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131456S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4753313,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Tiwari","affiliation":["Utopia Compression Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37653147800"},{"name":"Anurag Ganguli","affiliation":["Utopia Compression Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Ganguli","id":"37652109300"},{"name":"Ashwin Sampath","affiliation":["Utopia Compression Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Sampath","id":"37280816200"},{"name":"D.

AN is an enabling technology for network centric warfare. AN is different from the terrestrial mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and the wire-line internet, both in terms of network capability and underlying assumptions. The backbone nodes of the AN are envisioned to fly in pre-planned orbits whose knowledge can be exploited for efficient routing. In this paper we propose a dynamic adaptive routing protocol that uses known trajectories of the AN nodes to enhance performance. Our routing protocol has two components: (1) a Mobility Aware Routing Protocol (MARP), that routes traffic based on the knowledge of network topology with respect to time and makes preemptive decisions to minimize packet losses due to link failure and discover better routes, and (2) a Mobility Dissemination protocol (MDP) that informs all network nodes of any deviation from the preplanned behavior. We analyze MARP/MDP protocol suite using the QualNet network simulator for representative AN deployment scenarios and compare performance with proactive and reactive MANET routing protocols. We use packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency and control overhead as performance metrics. We also analyze the performance of the MARP/MDP routing protocol for varying degrees of prediction accuracy.

Continuous traffic capture makes the cost of monitoring infrastructure very expensive and hence count-based sampling methods are not scalable. However, the time-based sampling methods which were considered inaccurate in wired network characterization, seem to offer a cost-effective and scalable solution.

In this paper, we propose a statistical based approach to detect rogue access points using a hidden Markov model applied to passively measure packet-header data collected at a gateway router. Our approach utilizes variations in packet inter-arrival time to differentiate between authorized access points and rouge access points. We designed and developed our hidden Markov model by analyzing denial of service attacks and the traffic characteristics of 802.11 based wireless local area networks. Experimental validations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our trained Hidden Markov Model can detect the presence of a rogue access point promptly within one second with extreme accuracy (very low false positive and false negative ratios are obtained). The success of our approach lies in the fact that it leverages knowledge about the behaviour of the traffic characteristics of 802.11 based WLANs and properties of denial of service attacks. Our approach is scalable and non-intrusive, requiring little deployment cost and effort, and is easy to manage and maintain.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753358.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hidden Markov Model based approach to detect Rogue Access Points","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Telecommunication traffic","Monitoring","Computer crime","Traffic control","Wireless LAN","Radio frequency","Data security","Communication system security","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","internetworking","security of data","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","rogue access point detection","network administrators","packet-header data","gateway router","packet inter-arrival time","authorized access points","denial of service attacks","traffic characteristics","802.11 based wireless local area networks","WLAN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rogue Access Points","Hidden Markov","Models","Compromised Rogue Access Points","Denial of Service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Hidden Markov Model based approach to detect Rogue Access Points","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753358/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466165","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hidden Markov Model based approach to detect Rogue Access Points","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060359S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4753376,"authors":[{"name":"Zhefu Shi","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Zhefu","lastName":"Shi","id":"37654965700"},{"name":"Cory Beard","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Cory","lastName":"Beard","id":"37268315200"},{"name":"Ken Mitchell","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Mitchell","id":"37432633300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753376","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Spread spectrum communication","Multiaccess communication","Analytical models","Queueing analysis","Road accidents","Performance analysis","Throughput","Delay","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","matrix algebra","queueing theory","radio networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable traffic control","multihop CSMA networks","matrix exponential methods","node queueing","backoff processes","packet dropping","end-to-end delay","traffic rates","backoff rates","network location"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CSMA","QoS","matrix exponential"]}],"abstract":"A new analytical model for multihop CSMA networks is presented, using matrix exponential methods that model node queueing and backoff processes.

However, great challenges exist when they are applied to the MIMO communication systems due to the complexity of radio channels and networking. With multiple exchanges of request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS) packets, the proposed MIMO aware MAC protocol (MRH-MAC) can effectively utilize the characteristics of MIMO links and mitigate such drawbacks.

In situations in which a large number of cognitive radios are present in a given geographical area, these radios will likely have to be divided into multiple sensing clusters in order to keep bandwidth and power requirements manageable. In this paper, we propose different clustering methods for distributed spectrum sensing and evaluate their performance in terms of sensing reliability and resultant spectrum efficiency. The use of position information by clustering methods is also considered.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753432.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering methods for distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753432/","displayDocTitle":"Clustering methods for distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466229","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering methods for distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059489S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4753436,"authors":[{"name":"Mort Naraghi-Pour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Mort","lastName":"Naraghi-Pour","id":"38264308000"},{"name":"Takeshi Ikuma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ikuma","id":"37586994900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753436","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Diversity reception","Rayleigh channels","Chromium","White spaces","Cognitive radio","Frequency","Interference","Autocorrelation","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","multipath channels","probability","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity combining techniques","spectrum sensing reliability","multipath fading environments","cognitive radio","autocorrelation-based spectrum sensing algorithm","selective combining","equal gain correlation combining","detection probabilities","Rayleigh fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum Sensing","Dynamic Spectrum Access","Cognitive Radio","Diversity Techniques"]}],"abstract":"A key feature of a cognitive radio (CR) is a reliable spectrum sensing technique which enables the CR to detect the so-called white spaces in the frequency band. This allows opportunistic access of the unlicensed (secondary) users to these white spaces without causing undue interference to licensed (primary) users. In many scenarios the CR may operate in a multipath fading environment where spectrum sensing must cope with the fading effects of the unknown primary signal. In this paper we first study the effects of multipath fading of the performance of the autocorrelation-based spectrum sensing algorithm. The results show that Rayleigh fading causes significant degradation in the detection and false alarm. This motivates us to investigate three diversity combining techniques, namely equal gain combining, selective combining, and equal gain correlation combining. For Rayleigh fading channels we evaluate the performance of these three techniques through simulation. The results show that for detection probabilities of interest (e.g., > .9), a system with a four-branch diversity achieves an SNR gain of more than 5 dB over the no-diversity system that uses the same number of received signal samples.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753436","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753436.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753436","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity techniques for spectrum sensing in fading environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Diversity techniques for spectrum sensing in fading environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753436/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753436/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466232","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity techniques for spectrum sensing in fading environments","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095548S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753441,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Li","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaolong Li","id":"37406891200"},{"name":"Weihong Hu","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"lastName":"Weihong Hu","id":"37399455900"},{"name":"Homayoun Yousefi'zadeh","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Homayoun","lastName":"Yousefi'zadeh","id":"37269361600"},{"name":"Akber Qureshi","affiliation":["Network and Information Systems, The Boeing Company, USA"],"firstName":"Akber","lastName":"Qureshi","id":"37658728700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753441","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Software radio","Linux","Contracts","Ad hoc networks","Mobile ad hoc networks","Baseband","Radio frequency","Operating systems","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","Linux","MIMO communication","software radio","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO SDR implementation","software defined radio","operational mobile ad-hoc networks","baseband processing","RF frontend processing","Linux operating system","TCP/IP stack","TAP/TUN driver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Defined Radio","MIMO","USRP","GNU Radio","Click Router Module","PHY","MAC","FTP","HTTP","AUDIO"]}],"abstract":"Funded by a research contract from the Boeing Company, we report on the implementation of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) software defined radio (SDR) platform forming an operational Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) node.

Long-range wireless communications require high-power radio frequency (RF) amplifiers that are by far the most power consuming devices in the entire system. It is well known that efficient power amplifiers are highly nonlinear. However, highly efficient amplifiers such as the envelope elimination and restoration (EER) amplifiers as described herein are critical to mobile communications systems that require low power consumption for increased battery life and reduced size, weight, and power (SWAP), such as cell phones and military radios. The non-linearity of amplifiers generates both in-band noise (IBN) and out-of-band noise (OBN) which causes an increased bit error rate (BER) and adjacent channel interference (ACI), respectively. This degradation in performance has become a critical issue in recent years as newly emerging spectrally-efficient digital waveforms are being used for high-data rate communications. Linearization is necessary to comply with adjacent channel spectral mask requirements, to reduce BER, and to achieve acceptable amplifier efficiency. Predistortion can be used to convert a nonlinear amplifier into a linear amplifier. This paper describes a novel method for linearizing EER RF power amplifiers using adaptive subband predistortion.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753453","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753453.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearization of EER RF power amplifiers using an adaptive subband predistorter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Linearization of EER RF power amplifiers using an adaptive subband predistorter","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753453/","accessionNumber":"10466248","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753453/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearization of EER RF power amplifiers using an adaptive subband predistorter","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039369S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4753454,"authors":[{"name":"Cam Tran","affiliation":["SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific, San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Cam","lastName":"Tran","id":"37660834600"},{"name":"Ryan P.

Accessing the spectrum has become ever-increasingly problematic. This is due to the current practices of frequency management based on pre-planned and static frequency allocation and assignments that can no longer accommodate explosive demands for EM spectrum. Without a paradigm shift in spectrum management, the growth of wireless services to meet demands, whether from commercial, civil, or military interests, will be severely curtailed in the coming years. In particular, spectrum-dependent devices, equipment, and systems will increasingly encounter significant competitive disadvantages, with critical consequences on our warfighting capability, when accessing the (seemingly or actually) overcrowded EM spectrum upon deployment in the U.S., and more so overseas. On the road forward, the transformation of spectrum management from the current static spectrum allocation and assignment to a more dynamic and responsive regime is greatly facilitated by the emerging concept of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) that enables spectrum-dependent devices, equipment, and systems to dynamically change their parameters to adapt their spectrum access according to criteria such as policy constraints, spectrum availability, propagation environment, and application performance requirements. In this paper, we present an overview of DSA architectures - opportunistic as well as coordinated, highlight their salient features, and focus on their implications on radios, networks, and spectrum usage which will provide responsive tactical and enabling strategic capabilities to the warfighter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753454/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10466249","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753454/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access: Architectures and implications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access: Architectures and implications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056692S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4753455,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Duy La","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Quang Duy La","id":"37398129700"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yong Huat Chew","id":"37280653600"},{"name":"Woon Hau Chin","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Woon Hau Chin","id":"37331357200"},{"name":"Boon-Hee Soong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Boon-Hee Soong","id":"37280707600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753455","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Channel allocation","Cognitive radio","Convergence","Resource management","Interference","Nash equilibrium","Radio spectrum management","Frequency estimation","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","frequency allocation","game theory","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","distributed dynamic channel allocation scheme","transmission option","distributed resource allocation problem","noncooperative game model","Nash equilibrium convergence"]}],"abstract":"Game theory is a useful tool that can be used to study the distributed resource allocation problem, since each node in the network tries to maximize his own payoff and hence a need to resolve their conflicting interests. In this paper, we introduce utility functions so that the strategy set of each node allows no transmission. We incorporate the effect of interference a node is causing to the surroundings into its utility function so that those nodes which are not so favorable for transmission should sacrifice for the welfare of the network. Although non-cooperative game model is used, modifying the utility function in an effective way causes the overall impact to have some degree of ldquocooperationrdquo or ldquoself-awarenessrdquo among nodes. Our studies show that if utility function is properly chosen, a best-response allocation strategy does exist for each user. An algorithm which performs iterative update among nodes until Nash equilibrium convergence is proposed. Finally, we present our numerical results for our channel allocation game.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753455","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753455.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A game theoretic distributed dynamic channel allocation scheme with transmission option","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753455/","displayDocTitle":"A game theoretic distributed dynamic channel allocation scheme with transmission option","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466250","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753455/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game theoretic distributed dynamic channel allocation scheme with transmission option","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057643S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753467,"authors":[{"name":"Vijitha Weerackody","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University-Applied Physics Laboratory, Red Bank, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Vijitha","lastName":"Weerackody","id":"37296984700"},{"name":"Enrique Cuevas","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University-Applied Physics Laboratory, Red Bank, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Cuevas","id":"37296982300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753467","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite communication","Satellite antennas","Interference","Apertures","Military satellites","Random variables","Physics","Laboratories","Servomechanisms","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","satellite antennas","satellite communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-the-move satellite communications","satellite terminal","antenna pointing errors","effective isotropic radiated power","spectral density"]}],"abstract":"The mobile very small aperture terminal is a new satellite terminal with applications in both military and commercial sectors.

The planar form factor of phased array technology, along with the ability to steer beams electronically, has led to submarine antenna concepts that can simultaneously improve performance, utilize the submarine sail volume more efficiently, and minimize the impact to platform stealth. Through technology development under the Office of Naval Research (ONR), submarine-survivable phased arrays that address EHF SATCOM have been fabricated, tested, and delivered to the Navy by Boeing Phantom Works. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center has recently performed notional system integration and testing of these arrays. Q-band (44 GHz) uplink- and K-band (20 GHz) downlink-phased array antennas were tested successfully using both the military strategic and tactical relay (MILSTAR) and ultra high frequency follow-on (UFO) military satellites. The antennas were integrated with the Raytheon Follow-On Terminal (FOT) for full-duplex SATCOM testing. Full-duplex data rates of up to 64 kbps were attained using the phased arrays under optimal weather conditions. Bit error rate testing (BERT) was performed with no bit errors recorded. Initial tests were performed with the phased arrays mounted on a stationary platform; subsequent testing involved integration of the phased arrays into a notional housing atop a submarine mast. Notional mast testing included simulated ship motion using a six-axis motion table that is located on the roof of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport's (NUWCDIVNPT) Building 68 (B-68) with support from the Submarine EHF Satellite Communication Integration Facility (SESIF). Half-duplex testing was also performed using a fiber optic (FO) link to carry both the control and radio frequency (RF) signals for the downlink-phased array on a single FO cable. This paper will provide an overview of the array technology and will describe the configurations and results of SATCOM testing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of two-way Extremely High Frequency (EHF) satellite communication (SATCOM) using submarine-survivable phased arrays","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753497","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753497.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of two-way Extremely High Frequency (EHF) satellite communication (SATCOM) using submarine-survivable phased arrays","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753497/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466283","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of two-way Extremely High Frequency (EHF) satellite communication (SATCOM) using submarine-survivable phased arrays","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053239S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4753501,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Torres","affiliation":["MITRE Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Torres","id":"37380180200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753501","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"abstract":"Transponded Ka-band military satellite communications (SATCOM) enables airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, such as the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), to deliver up to 274 Mbps of high data rate sensor information to beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) ground terminals.

Presented in this paper are three OFDM-based techniques to illustrate the unique potentials of the OFDM techniques for supporting current and future MILSATCOM requirements. Explored in the recent JTEO research efforts, these OFDM-based techniques are intended for, (1) Supporting broadband (High Data Rate) HDR transmission through multi-channel clustering; (2) Extending TDM/TDMA-based IP transmissions; (3) Spread spectrum for anti-jamming. Although they are initially explored for MILSATCOM networks through WGS systems, the concepts and techniques can be applied to communication networks through other transponded satellite systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM modulation schemes for military satellite communications","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753506","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753506.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"OFDM modulation schemes for military satellite communications","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753506/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466289","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM modulation schemes for military satellite communications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04342S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4753511,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeev Gopal","affiliation":["LLC, Hughes Network Systems, Germantown, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Gopal","id":"38553438400"},{"name":"Steve Arnold","affiliation":["LLC, Hughes Network Systems, Germantown, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Arnold","id":"37647656000"},{"name":"Lisa Orr","affiliation":["Defense Information Systems Agency, Falls Church, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Lisa","lastName":"Orr","id":"37661704700"},{"name":"Syed Ali","affiliation":["Defense Information Systems Agency, Falls Church, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Syed","lastName":"Ali","id":"37650586400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753511","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753511","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite communication","IP networks","Artificial satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Intelligent sensors","Space technology","Telecommunication standards","Downlink","Demodulation","Terrorism"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","IP networks","military communication","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network centric satellite communication","IP networks","regenerative satellite Mesh-A Ka band technology","national defense","IP-convergence","DoD SATCOM networking","Global Information Grid","on-board packet processing","bandwidth on demand","full-mesh multi Gbps IP packet processing SATCOM","satellite system architectures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753511","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753511.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network centric satellite communication with IP networks based on regenerative satellite Mesh-A (RSM-A) Ka band technology","abstract":"Network centric unification of diverse communication and information sharing systems is a key objective for national defense.

Most existing results on MIMO ad hoc networks assume perfect CSI. This assumption is usually unrealistic in practice because the feedback overhead of perfect CSI is prohibitively high. Thus, it is of great interest to study how to optimize the performance of MIMO-based ad hoc networks under imperfect CSI. In this paper, we propose a solution based on stochastic approximation technique to address imperfect CSI. To analyze the performance gap due to the existence of CSI error, we first show that our proposed solution is stable and converges with probability one to a neighborhood of an optimal solution obtained under perfect CSI. Based on this stability result, we characterize the performance gap due to imperfect CSI. We show that the boundary of the stability neighborhood is constituted by points for which the excess capacity of each link is equal to the ergodic link capacity loss due to imperfect CSI. Thus, as the amount of CSI feedback increases, the performance gap of our proposed solution vanishes.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753523.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of MIMO-based ad hoc networks under imperfect CSI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","MIMO","Transmitters","Channel state information","Stochastic processes","Performance analysis","Stability","Channel capacity","State feedback","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","feedback","MIMO communication","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imperfect channel state information","feedback overhead","MIMO-based ad hoc networks","stochastic approximation technique","stability","ergodic link capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of MIMO-based ad hoc networks under imperfect CSI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753523/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466303","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of MIMO-based ad hoc networks under imperfect CSI","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066527S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753524,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liang","id":"37406928600"},{"name":"Qilian Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qilian","lastName":"Liang","id":"37272705100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753524","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"In this paper we investigate a methodology named channel selection with the aim of balancing the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) advantage and the complexity of node cooperations for wireless sensor networks (WSN).

Many of these MAC protocols look to improve on the total number of concurrent links within the network. In this paper, we present a theoretical approach for identifying the maximum number of concurrent links (MNCL) in a MIMO enabled MANET, subject to the constraint that all links provide a minimum QoS measured in terms of signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). We assume that each receiver uses an MMSE based detector which provides a balance between completely nulling of neighboring interference and hardware complexity. As a byproduct of the MNCL, the solution will provide the optimum power allocation for the nodes as well as the optimum concurrent link allocation. The proposed approach is readily applicable to MIMO systems using Receive Diversity, Transmit Beamforming, and Space Time Block Coding (STBC). The results show that the MNCL can be improved significantly by exploiting multi-user diversity and increasing the number of receiver antennas. But the improvement from allowing higher transmit power is not significant. The derived MNCL capacity can be used to highlight theoretical insights for practical designs.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753525","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753525.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent link capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks with QoS constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753525/","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent link capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks with QoS constraint","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466304","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753525/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent link capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks with QoS constraint","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104504S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753526,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry R.

Data were collected in Baltimore, Maryland using a 2times3 MIMO testbed in June 2007. Testing consisted of transmitting orthogonal channel probes from a stationary transmit test van and using a mobile receive van that collected data while traveling through predetermined routes in the city. Data were collected on both straight line-of-sight (LOS) paths and on L-shaped routes that involved turning onto a perpendicular street that was not within LOS of the transmitter. Statistics of the fading were characterized and found to exhibit Ricean behavior in LOS regions and Rayleigh statistics in non-LOS regions. The channel transfer matrix was computed based on measured data and used to infer the MIMO communications channel capacity as a function of distance from the transmitter and antenna spacing. The measured capacity was compared to the theoretical capacity of a 2times3 reference system with a stationary channel. These comparisons show that MIMO processing is capable of increasing the capacity by a factor of 1.3 to 1.8 relative to the reference system. Results are also presented that show capacity is insensitive to antenna spacing down to a minimum spacing of 0.25lambda for the conditions encountered in this study.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753526","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO channel measurements for urban military applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO channel measurements for urban military applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753526/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466305","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4753526/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO channel measurements for urban military applications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052796S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4753527,"authors":[{"name":"Gunnar Eriksson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","FOI, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Gunnar","lastName":"Eriksson","id":"37296874500"},{"name":"Sara Linder","affiliation":["FOI, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Linder","id":"37430426700"},{"name":"Kia Wiklundh","affiliation":["FOI, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kia","lastName":"Wiklundh","id":"37395893900"},{"name":"Peter D.

When designing and evaluating such systems, knowledge of realistic propagation conditions is required. This paper presents results from an urban MIMO measurement campaign at 300 MHz. Measurements are performed along 25 receiver routes and for three fixed transmitter locations, using antenna arrays mounted on two cars. Channel characteristics and ergodic capacity for the 7 times 7 MIMO channels are extracted from the measured data. A path-loss model is derived for the measured scenario, and the distributions of the large-scale fading, the Ricean K-factor, the delay spread, and the ergodic capacity are studied in detail. The correlation distance for the different channel parameters is also examined. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that several of the channel parameters are correlated, and also have a strong correlation with the capacity.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753527","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753527.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Urban peer-to-peer MIMO channel measurements and analysis at 300 MHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Urban peer-to-peer MIMO channel measurements and analysis at 300 MHz","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753527/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466306","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4753527/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Urban peer-to-peer MIMO channel measurements and analysis at 300 MHz","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080815S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753529,"authors":[{"name":"Soonchul Park","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soonchul","lastName":"Park","id":"37657114700"},{"name":"Jaechan Lee","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaechan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37656548400"},{"name":"Dong Seog Han","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Seog Han","id":"37287051400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753529","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"abstract":"In this paper, we provide an analysis of an adequate dimension of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for full multiplexing in 16-QAM signaling. There are many results of small MIMO system with various schemes. However, because of the unrealistic complexity and meaningless required signal to noise ratio (SNR), results for large (over 20 data streams) MIMO systems can be hardly found. We obtain from our simulations the most efficient size of the MIMO system in a realistic SNR range for each given number of data streams. We also provide the computational complexity of each algorithm for MIMO systems with 20 or more data streams. We conclude from our simulations that the performance depends on the ratio of the number of receivers and the number of transmitters.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of the efficient size of a MIMO system for full multiplexing in 16-QAM signaling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","MIMO","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Computational complexity","Radio transmitters","Receiving antennas","Maximum likelihood detection","Computational modeling","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","MIMO communication","multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","multiplexing","16-QAM signaling","multiple-input multiple-output system","signal to noise ratio","SNR","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of the efficient size of a MIMO system for full multiplexing in 16-QAM signaling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466308","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of the efficient size of a MIMO system for full multiplexing in 16-QAM signaling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056848S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753530,"authors":[{"name":"Kelvin Lee","affiliation":["EE Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Kelvin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37540308500"},{"name":"Babak Daneshrad","affiliation":["EE Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Daneshrad","id":"37279708000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753530","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Lattices","MIMO","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood detection","Throughput","Detectors","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood decoding","Kelvin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","error statistics","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-valued lattice formulation","MIMO system","multiple-input multiple-output decoder","fixed complexity sphere decoder algorithm","bit error rate","lattice searching efficiency","two-stage approximate sorting scheme","MIMO decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) decoder which combines fixed complexity sphere decoder (FSD) algorithm with a new real-valued lattice formulation to simultaneously improve the throughput, bit error rate (BER), complexity and power.

A perturbation vector is employed as well to reduce the transmitted power. Joint optimization of the linear precoder and the perturbation vector enhances the performance of the algorithm. As a result, the EDLP features full diversity order and full spatial multiplexing order. Furthermore, compared with other precoding techniques, EDLP requires less computational complexity.

Current blind beamforming algorithms require computational complexity too high for many target applications. NED does not rely on the eignenvalues and eigenvectors used by conventional algorithms and requires significantly less computations, with a total computational load of O(4M-4) per snapshot for a system with M receiving antennas by approximating the cross correlation vector of the received signals in the reference and other antennas. The weight vector is a function of only the cross correlation vector and initial guess and does not require a step size. This technique requires neither a training sequence nor an assumption of incoherency among impinging signals. Simulations show that NED achieves comparable performance as other blind beamforming algorithms in nulling interference sources The smart antenna structure for NED implementation in spread spectrum and OFDM system will also be discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753536","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753536.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753536","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal complexity blind interference mitigation via Non-Eigen Decomposition beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Minimal complexity blind interference mitigation via Non-Eigen Decomposition beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753536/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753536/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466315","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal complexity blind interference mitigation via Non-Eigen Decomposition beamforming","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058839S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753538,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wen Zhou","id":"37397625700"},{"name":"W.

A novel method of Doppler shift estimation for OFDM systems in time varying and frequency selective fading channels has been proposed and investigated. The proposed method is a frequency domain scheme that utilizes pilot subcarriers, which are adopted in most practical OFDM systems. An equation consisting of the Doppler shift has been derived from the ratio of two autocorrelation sample points at the receiver so that the Doppler shift estimation can be retrieved. Since the computation for solving the equation is formidable, the proposed algorithm has also been further simplified by using the optimal polynomial approximation to the zero order Bessel function of the first kind. Computer simulation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can estimate the Doppler shift accurately within a wide range of Doppler shift.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753538","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel method of Doppler shift estimation for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel method of Doppler shift estimation for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753538/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466317","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4753538/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method of Doppler shift estimation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039372S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753540,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Moffatt","affiliation":["Harris Corporation, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Moffatt","id":"37662342400"},{"name":"Ivica Kostanic","affiliation":["Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ivica","lastName":"Kostanic","id":"37297914500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753540","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Energy consumption","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Frequency conversion","Frequency modulation","Robustness","Fading","Fast Fourier transforms","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","range extension","orthogonal frequency division modulation","multicarrier modulation scheme","wireless communication systems","fading channel","inverse fast Fourier transforms","peak-to- average power ratio","power amplifier","pseudorandom noise scrambling technique","IEEE 802.11a standard"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (OFDM) is an efficient multi-carrier modulation scheme.

Standard equalization techniques such as zero-forcing (ZF), and adaptive array processing techniques such as per-tone or time-domain equalization, may require large amounts of training and memory for storage of the weight coefficients. In a MIMO-OFDM system with N carriers, ZF considerations help dictate required equalizer lengths, which are characterized by the solution space associated with an underdetermined system of linear equations. In the practical case where the cyclic prefix length, and hence the channel length, is a fraction of the OFDM frame duration, it is shown that the respective equalizers to all tones (across antennas) are characterized by the basis of a data-independent, low-dimensional subspace. A structured per-tone technique is proposed that utilizes the extra degrees of freedom afforded by having multiple antennas at the receiver in order to cancel interfering signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced dimension equalizer and interference canceller for MIMO-OFDM","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753545","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753545.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reduced dimension equalizer and interference canceller for MIMO-OFDM","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753545/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466324","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced dimension equalizer and interference canceller for MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076726S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753547,"authors":[{"name":"Sadia Ahmed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of South Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Sadia","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37289344400"},{"name":"Huseyin Arslan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of South Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37279667100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753547","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":577},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Radio frequency","Underwater acoustics","OFDM","Degradation","Receivers","Performance loss","Ultra wideband technology","Underwater communication","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler effect","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency offset","Doppler effect","terrestrial UWB RF","underwater acoustic OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","mobility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler Effect","Frequency Offset","OFDM","Orthogonality","Underwater Acoustics","UWB-OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Frequency offset and Doppler effect cause loss of orthogonality in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which in turn may severely degrade receiver performance.

Being also capable of transmitting in a non-contiguous fashion by utilizing several seperate spectral whitespaces, it is an ideal candidate for dynamic spectrum access (DSA)-based transceiver systems. However, the large sidelobes emerging from OFDM signal transmissions need to be reduced in order to conform to the FCC spectrum masks, thus enabling the coexistence between licensed and unlicensed transceivers. In this paper, we propose a cancellation carrier-based sidelobe suppression technique for OFDM-based cognitive radios. A selected number of subcarrier locations on either side of the OFDM spectrum are reserved for inserting cancellation carriers whose amplitude and phase are determined by using a straight-forward algebraic technique. The algorithm performing this algebraic technique is based on the fact that the subcarriers near the edges of the OFDM signal spectrum possess a greater impact on the sidelobe power levels than those that are interior in the transmission spectrum. Simulation results show that with only one cancellation carrier on each side of a 64 subcarrier QPSK-OFDM spectrum, there is a reduction of as much as 10 dB on the peak-interference causing sidelobe by considering the impact of 25% of the total number of number of subcarriers on the interference power levels. With two cancellation carriers on each side, the reduction is around 13 dB.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753556","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753556.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sub-optimal sidelobe suppression technique for OFDM-based cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753556/","displayDocTitle":"A sub-optimal sidelobe suppression technique for OFDM-based cognitive radios","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466334","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753556/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sub-optimal sidelobe suppression technique for OFDM-based cognitive radios","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038857S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4753557,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Yuan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37399214100"},{"name":"Srikanth Pagadarai","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"Pagadarai","id":"37402675600"},{"name":"Alexander M.

OFDM is widely deployed in numerous wireless access networks since it can achieve high data rate while simultaneously being robust to the effects of multipath propagation. Despite these advantages, OFDM produces a substantial amount of out-of-band (OOB) interference that can potentially disrupt communications in adjacent wireless channels. A GA is a search technique that is employed to iteratively find the optimal solution given large solution spaces. To reduce the OOB emissions of an OFDM transmission, GAs can be employed to determine the amplitude and phase values of cancellation carriers (CCs), which are signals designed to cancel out the OOB emissions when added to this transmitted signal. Note that the CCs themselves do not carry any data, thus a delicate trade-off between overall data throughput and interference mitigation must be considered. However, with this CCs technique, there is a small loss in bit error rate which is caused by the fact that a certain amount of transmission power is wasted. Performance comparisons of the proposed GA technique with two other techniques presented in the open literature have been conducted.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753557.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cancellation carrier technique using genetic algorithm for OFDM sidelobe suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","OFDM","Carbon capture and storage","Interference","Wireless networks","Robustness","Wireless communication","Signal design","Throughput","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancellation carrier technique","genetic algorithm","OFDM sidelobe suppression","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","sidelobe power reduction","wireless access networks","out-of-band interference","wireless channels","interference mitigation","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cancellation carrier technique using genetic algorithm for OFDM sidelobe suppression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466335","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cancellation carrier technique using genetic algorithm for OFDM sidelobe suppression","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054263S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4753558,"authors":[{"name":"Heejung Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heejung","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275012800"},{"name":"Youngchul Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngchul","lastName":"Sung","id":"37286810600"},{"name":"Yong H.

Based on this theoretical result, we propose the new transmission scheme in which a secondary transmitter relays primary userpsilas signal with a full-duplex amplify and forward (AF) manner while transmitting its own data at the same time. In the proposed method, we take account of practical implementation issues which are ignored in the theoretical method guaranteeing an upper bound of a rate region.

This paper introduces a novel cognitive coexistence framework between infrastructure and ad hoc networks. Based on sensing and predicting the ad-hoc networkpsilas activity, the infrastructure system allocates power and transmission time such as to minimize its impact on the ad-hoc links. This leads to an interference-aware resource allocation. A rate-constraint ensures that the infrastructure system maintains a specified quality-of-service, despite adapting its transmission behavior to accommodate ad-hoc users. Based on an ON/OFF continuous-time Markov chain model, the optimal allocation of power and transmission time is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Closed-form solutions are derived as a function of Lagrange multipliers. An iterative algorithm with guaranteed convergence to the optimal solution is developed. Finally, our results are extended to an average-rate formulation. Numerical performance analysis illustrates that utilizing the superior flexibility of the infrastructure links can effectively mitigate interference.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753561","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753561.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-aware OFDMA resource allocation: A predictive approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference-aware OFDMA resource allocation: A predictive approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753561/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466339","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4753561/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-aware OFDMA resource allocation: A predictive approach","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074822S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753562,"authors":[{"name":"Tianming Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA","WINLaboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Tianming","lastName":"Li","id":"37656929000"},{"name":"Sudharman K.

The previous work on power control in cognitive radios has mainly focused on the interactions among a set of secondary users while ignoring the influence of primary users. In [1], we introduced a new game model for power control in cognitive radios by incorporating the primary users into the player set of the game. In this new framework, the primary users are rewarded (for example, monetarily) for sharing their licensed spectrum with secondary users. In our proposed game formulation, they achieve this by setting a reasonable interference cap (IC) for the secondary users. However, the primary users are to be severely penalized if they do not meet their transmission quality. To ensure this, an exponential pricing term is incorporated into their utility function. Simultaneously, the secondary users aim to achieve energy efficient transmissions while not introducing too much interference to the primary as well as other secondary users. In this paper, we investigate the CR system design aspects based on our proposed new game theoretic spectrum sharing framework. In particular, the performance of the system is compared under different linear detector schemes at the secondary receiver, namely, the matched filter (MF) and the linear MMSE (LMMSE) receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753562/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10466340","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753562/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel primary-secondary user power control game for cognitive radios with linear receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel primary-secondary user power control game for cognitive radios with linear receivers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069534S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753567,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Shin Jo","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Han-Shin","lastName":"Jo","id":"37531785900"},{"name":"Jong-Gwan Yook","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Gwan","lastName":"Yook","id":"37277003100"},{"name":"Cheol Mun","affiliation":["Chungju National University (CITC), Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheol","lastName":"Mun","id":"37266741300"},{"name":"June Moon","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"June","lastName":"Moon","id":"37653785700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753567","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":670},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Energy management","Femtocell networks","Interference suppression","Macrocell networks","Open loop systems","Throughput","Base stations","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","closed loop systems","interference suppression","power control","telecommunication control","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organized uplink power control","cross-tier interference management","femtocell network","interference mitigation strategy","macrocell base station","closed-loop control","open-loop control","adaptive threshold"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes two interference mitigation strategies that adjust the maximum transmit power of femtocell users to suppress the cross-tier interference at a macrocell base station (BS).

This problem becomes more challenging under the harsh and bandwidth limited conditions imposed by military applications. In this framework, the software agent running at the application layer for each autonomous mobile node adjusts its direction and speed by using local information from its neighbors. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used by each node to select the ldquofitterrdquo speed and direction options among exponentially large number of choices converging towards a uniform distribution. For a military application example, consider that in the observed occurrence of a threat situation, if the number of autonomous mobile agents change with time (e.g., losing assets during an operation), the remaining agents should reposition themselves to compensate the lost in coverage and network connectivity. We implemented simulation software to evaluate the effectiveness of GAs within these types of military applications. The results show that GAs can be applied to autonomous mobile nodes and are an effective tool for providing a robust solution for network area coverage under restrained communication conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753584/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10466362","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753584/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uniform distribution of mobile agents using genetic algorithms for military applications in MANETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform distribution of mobile agents using genetic algorithms for military applications in MANETs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074735S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4753594,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"Hyuck M.

The problem of selecting suitable partners for a cooperative strategy is more complex when prospective partners have links of dissimilar quality to a central destination, leading to the possibility of non-reciprocal cooperation. We analyze self-configuring cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiplex wireless networks under conditions of minimal topology and channel link information available to individual users. For such cases, a robust auction-theoretic mechanism is proposed for the selection of single as well as multiple simultaneous cooperative partners. We characterize equilibrium strategies and revenue for the multiple-object second-price auction for multi-carrier cooperation, under conditions of uncertainty in the number of users requesting cooperation. The proposed auction-theoretic selection scheme is shown to be a robust decentralized solution for improving the outage probability in dynamic cooperative wireless systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753594.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple partner selection in cooperative OFDM networks using an auction strategy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Protocols","Downlink","Decoding","Wireless networks","Robustness","Relays","Fading","MIMO","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cellular radio","diversity reception","OFDM modulation","probability","protocols","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple partner selection","cooperative OFDM network","auction-theoretic mechanism","mobile user","cellular network","wireless data network","cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiplex wireless network","minimal topology","channel link information","probability","ad hoc network","communication protocol","distributed spatial diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiple partner selection in cooperative OFDM networks using an auction strategy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753594/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466371","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple partner selection in cooperative OFDM networks using an auction strategy","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090935S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753595,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Bradley Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37276885400"},{"name":"Y.

We demonstrate the practical usability of CORE in a hybrid wired-wireless scenario composed of both physical and emulated nodes, carrying live audio and video streams.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10466388","htmlLink":"/document/4753614/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"CORE: A real-time network emulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CORE: A real-time network emulator","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045719S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4753617,"authors":[{"name":"Melissa Duarte","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Melissa","lastName":"Duarte","id":"37286100200"},{"name":"Ashutosh Sabharwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Sabharwal","id":"37270204100"},{"name":"Chris Dick","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Dick","id":"37284012700"},{"name":"Raghu Rao","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Rao","id":"38560364000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753617","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Quantization","Virtual manufacturing","WiMAX","Feedback","Bit error rate","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector mapping scheme","beamforming MIMO systems","quantized feedback","multiple antenna systems","beamforming codebook designs","channel quantizer","WiMAX"]}],"abstract":"Quantized feedback in multiple antenna systems has the potential to increase throughput and/or reduce probability of outage.

As a key component of the CR technology, spectrum sensing has been investigated actively in existing literature. Among all the problems related to spectrum sensing, two of them seem to be challenging: first, CR users are likely to miss the detection of the primary users, resulting in low sensing accuracy; second, to guarantee the frequency bands are available, CR users have to spend a large amount of time sensing those bands, which inevitably decreases their data transmission opportunities, leading to the so-called sensing efficiency problem. This paper proposes a bargaining based pairwise cooperative spectrum sensing (BBPCSS) scheme as a possible solution. In order to increase the sensing accuracy, the CR users are grouped into pairs for cooperative sensing instead of individual sensing. In each pair, rational CR users can bargain with each other over the sensing time division, and thus save the sensing time for data transmission. Our analysis and simulation results suggest that BBPCSS effectively improves the detection probability and enhances the sensing efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10466404","htmlLink":"/document/4753630/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bargaining based pairwise cooperative spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bargaining based pairwise cooperative spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083967S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753631,"authors":[{"name":"Jack L.

Until recently, little work had been done in the general area of wireless network security and specifically the area of performance in the presence of jamming. Discussions on this topic have been inhibited in the greater CR community by a poorly defined lexicon, which makes addressing issues such as security and performance in jamming difficult.

In practice, multi-hop routing in CR networks presents a great challenge due to unreliable traditional links and time varying unlicensed CR links. To improve the performance of multi-hop routing, opportunistic routing (OR) has been proposed and investigated extensively. Instead of using a single next hop, OR forwards a packet to an ordered set of candidate nodes and one node is chosen to relay the packet towards the destination. Most OR protocols prioritize the candidates and make the selection based on the cost defined as expected transmission times (ETX). Actually, ETX, as well as other existing criteria, does not always lead to the best forwarder choice for OR in CR networks since it ignores numerous potential CR links. In this paper, we propose a novel cost criterion for opportunistic multi-hop routing in CR networks, which leverages the unlicensed CR links to prioritize the candidate nodes and optimally selecting the forwarder. Simulation results show that our design efficiently decreases the number of transmissions, and effectively increases the throughput for most node pairs when compared with OR and traditional single-path routing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10466406","htmlLink":"/document/4753632/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cost design for opportunistic multi-hop routing in Cognitive Radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost design for opportunistic multi-hop routing in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082777S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753633,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Su","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hang Su","id":"37280809500"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xi Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2676-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2677-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4753633","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","Analytical models","Cognitive radio","Transceivers","Frequency","Queueing analysis","Performance analysis","Aggregates","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","queueing theory","telecommunication congestion control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel cognitive MAC protocol","dynamic access spectrum networks","DSA networks","cognitive radio","multiple channel sensors","collision avoidance","queuing theory","packet transmission delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum access (DSA)","multi-channel MAC","queuing theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753633","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753633","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","abstract":"This paper proposes a decentralized cognitive radio based multi-channel MAC protocol for dynamic access spectrum (DSA) networks.

Efficient data dissemination in such networks is a challenging problem, since sensors with detections must be able to identify functioning routes to all relevant end-users. In this research, we have developed a framework for efficient data dissemination over energy- and bandwidth-constrained WSNs, which accommodates end-user mobility. Our technical approach is based on communication abstractions provided by Hyper Cast [30], which is an open-source platform for application-layer communication. We use the Delaunay triangulation (DT) topology of Hyper Cast to organize the one-to-many and one-tone communications from sensors to end users and sensors to sensors, respectively. The advantages of Hyper Cast based data dissemination are discussed in detail and are compared to other communication protocols. We illustrate this framework in a ldquoPatrol Scenariordquo simulation testbed, involving a set of unattended ground sensors and mobile end users trying to maximize both (i) the rate of capturing intruders passing through an area of interest and (ii) the operating lifetime of the sensor field.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753644","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723889/4753027/04753644.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753644","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of overlay-based data dissemination over Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of overlay-based data dissemination over Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753644/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753644/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10466418","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of overlay-based data dissemination over Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122009-00617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093204S","chronDate":"16-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723889","isNumber":"4753027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753027","articleId":"4753644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4753686,"authors":[{"name":"Joung-Yeal Kim","affiliation":["Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, South Korea","School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joung-Yeal","lastName":"Kim","id":"37657356900"},{"name":"Young-Hyun Jun","affiliation":["Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hyun","lastName":"Jun","id":"37270382500"},{"name":"Bai-Sun Kong","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bai-Sun","lastName":"Kong","id":"37358397800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4753686","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1303},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge pumps","Clocks","Timing","Boosting","Charge transfer","Threshold voltage","CMOS process","Temperature","Diodes","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS charge pump","transfer blocking technique","no reversion loss","relaxed clock timing restriction","boosting level","switching ripple","voltage doubler","voltage generator","size 80 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blocking technique","charge pump","voltage doubler","voltage generator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753686","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4753685/04753686.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.2008521","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.2008521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS Charge Pump With Transfer Blocking Technique for No Reversion Loss and Relaxed Clock Timing Restriction","abstract":"A CMOS charge pump based on a transfer blocking technique and a modified precharge scheme is proposed for avoiding reversion loss and relaxing the timing restrictions imposed on input clocks.

While the first algorithm eliminates ROM and requires only low-complexity barrel shifters, the second eliminates barrel shifters completely. As a consequence, both the algorithms consume approximately 50% area in comparison with other CORDIC designs. Further, the proposed algorithms are applicable to the entire range of angles. The FPGA implementations consume approximately 8% LUTs of a Xilinx Spartan XC2S200E device and have a slice-delay product of about 3. Convergence proofs for the algorithms are presented. Experimental comparisons with prior CORDIC designs confirm the efficacy of the proposed designs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays","Read only memory","Algorithm design and analysis","Table lookup","Circuits","Convergence","Phase estimation","Hardware","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","read-only storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient CORDIC algorithms","low area implementation","high throughput implementation","area-efficient algorithms","ROM","low-complexity barrel shifters","FPGA","LUT","Xilinx Spartan XC2S200E device","slice-delay product","convergence proofs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Barrel shifter","coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC)","extended range","low area and high throughput implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753697","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.2010169","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4753685/04753697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.2010169","startPage":"61","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient CORDIC Algorithms and Architectures for Low Area and High Throughput Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient CORDIC Algorithms and Architectures for Low Area and High Throughput Implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753697/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4753697/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10500937","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient CORDIC Algorithms and Architectures for Low Area and High Throughput Implementation","sourcePdf":"tcsii-sridharan-2010169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069039S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4753685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4753685","articleId":"4753697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4753699,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Hernandez Corporales","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Technology, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Hernandez Corporales","id":"37088045066"},{"name":"Enrique Prefasi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Technology, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Prefasi","id":"37268485400"},{"name":"Ernesto Pun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Technology, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Pun","id":"37410076900"},{"name":"Susana Paton","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Technology, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Susana","lastName":"Paton","id":"37274425000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4753699","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":928},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753699","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Delta-sigma modulation","Digital modulation","Digital-analog conversion","Filters","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Signal generators","Feedback loop","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","quantisation (signal)","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous-time sigma-delta ADC","time encoding quantizer","loop filter output","binary signal","pulsewidth modulation","frequency 1.2 MHz","size 0.35 micron","word length 10 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data conversion","pulsewidth modulation (PWM)","sigma delta modulation","time encoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows the operating principle and experimental results of a new continuous-time sigma-delta modulator architecture.

This paper discusses the adaptive sliding mode control for the piezo-actuated stage, where the hysteresis is described by the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model. This paper tries to fuse the hysteresis model with the adaptive control techniques, where the real value of the parameters of the stage need neither be identified nor be measured.

To handle the coupled behavior of dynamics and hysteresis, a cascade model is presented to enable the application of inversion-based feedforward control. The dynamics, which include vibration and creep, are modeled using linear transfer functions. A frequency-based method is used to invert the linear model to find an input that compensates for vibration and creep. The inverse is noncausal for nonminimum-phase systems. Similarly, the hysteresis is handled by an inverse-Preisach model. To avoid the complexity of finding the inverse-Preisach model, high- gain feedback control can be used to linearize the system's behavior. A feedforward input is then combined with the feedback system to compensate for the linear dynamics to achieve high-speed AFM imaging. Finally, recent efforts in feedforward control for an SPM application including the use of iteration to handle hysteresis as well as uncertainties and variations in the system model is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2008.930922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/4753726/04753744.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2008.930922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedforward control of piezoactuators in atomic force microscope systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753744/","displayDocTitle":"Feedforward control of piezoactuators in atomic force microscope systems","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416647","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753744/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedforward control of piezoactuators in atomic force microscope systems","sourcePdf":"18-29mcs01-leang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098792S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"4753726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"4753726","articleId":"4753744","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4753745,"authors":[{"name":"Ram V.

As the effects of gain- and phase imbalance and DC offset are increasing with the bandwidth of a transmitter, they must be corrected for because otherwise digital predistortion for PApsilas becomes ineffective. An important implementation aspect for many impairment correction schemes is the realization of the required feedback loop including the downconversion from the RF- to the baseband domain. We propose an IQ and DC offset estimation and compensation method which uses a simple detector diode in the feedback path. The characteristic of the detector diode needs not to be known, which makes implementation easy. It is shown by simulation and measurements, that the method works excellent for narrowband as well as for wideband signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4753809/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415027","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the estimation and compensation of IQ impairments in direct conversion transmitters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the estimation and compensation of IQ impairments in direct conversion transmitters","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SPI-01132009-00049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09041S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747409","isNumber":"4753760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747409","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4753760","articleId":"4753809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4753811,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Herzel","affiliation":["IHP GmbH Im Technologiepark 25, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Herzel","id":"37301192800"},{"name":"Chang-Soon Choi","affiliation":["IHP GmbH Im Technologiepark 25, Frankfurt, Germany"],"lastName":"Chang-Soon Choi","id":"37280244300"},{"name":"Eckhard Grass","affiliation":["IHP GmbH Im Technologiepark 25, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Eckhard","lastName":"Grass","id":"37276988600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-008-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4753811","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synthesizers","OFDM","Transceivers","Phase locked loops","Phase noise","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Error correction","Bandwidth","Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synthesizers","microwave oscillators","millimetre wave oscillators","OFDM modulation","personal area networks","phase locked loops","transceivers","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synthesis","OFDM transceivers","integer-N PLL architecture","IEEE 802.15 channel plan","sliding-IF architecture","voltage-controlled oscillator","crystal reference","silicon-based millimetre-wave transceivers","crystal noise floor","VCO phase noise","frequency 60 GHz","frequency 48 GHz","frequency 19.2 GHz"]}],"abstract":"We present an integer-N PLL architecture for 60 GHz OFDM systems compatible with the IEEE 802.15.3c channel plan.

The secondary link employs orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) at the transmitter and maximum likelihood (ML) decoding at the receiver. For this system, we focus on designing linear precoders assuming the knowledge of the transmit antenna fading correlations for both the secondary-transmitter to primary-receiver (ST-PR) and secondary-transmitter to secondary-receiver (ST-SR) links at the secondary transmitter. Given a limited power budget of the secondary transmitter, the precoder is designed to minimize the minimum-distance average pair-wise error probability (PEP) of the secondary user subject to the average interference-power constraint at the primary receiver. We present two sub-optimal solutions based on the eigen-beamforming on ST-SR channel and interference nulling on ST-PR channel.

We consider coexistence environment of primary systems, e.g. 4th generation mobile cellular system (4G), TV broadcasting and cognitive radio system, e.g. ultra wideband (UWB) systems. UWB systems are required to have detect and avoid (DAA) technique which can detect the signals from primary systems and avoid the interference from them. We introduce two important benchmarks. Computer simulations have been performed to confirm these analytical results. In addition, the design issue of cognitive radio systems is discussed based on these numerical results. Moreover, we discuss the detection technique of primary system signals for UWB radio system with DAA and the the performance of the UWB radio system using DAA via computer simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753821/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10415038","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753821/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of spectrum management technique by using cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of spectrum management technique by using cognitive radio","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SPI-01132009-00061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043533S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747409","isNumber":"4753760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747409","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4753760","articleId":"4753821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753822,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This approach consists of simulating each antenna in the antenna array to compute its embedded element pattern including all of the near-field electromagnetic and coupling effects. These embedded patterns are then uploaded into the measurement-based statistical spatial channel model (SCM) to study the link-level performance of the MIMO system. The equivalence between the coupling matrix of an antenna array and the embedded element pattern of each antenna is theoretically derived and verified. We compute the channel matrix in two approaches. First, either the theoretically calculated or the simulated embedded radiation patterns are used with SCM to compute the channel matrix. Second, the coupling matrix is used with the default SCM algorithm to compute the channel matrix. Then, the MIMO system capacity is computed and compared. The results show very good agreement between the two approaches. Our approach is general as it includes the detailed near-field EM effects such as the effects of the case and the user on the handset MIMO system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 European Conference on Wireless Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747409/4753760/04753827.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"146","publicationTitle":"2008 European Conference on Wireless Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modeling approach for simulating MIMO systems with near-field effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational modeling","Electromagnetic modeling","Antenna arrays","Embedded computing","Electromagnetic coupling","Antenna theory","Antenna measurements","Electromagnetic measurements","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","near-field effects","full-wave electromagnetic simulations","statistical channel models","antenna array","spatial channel model","channel matrix","radiation patterns","SCM algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A modeling approach for simulating MIMO systems with near-field effects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753827/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415043","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modeling approach for simulating MIMO systems with near-field effects","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SPI-01132009-00067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056249S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747409","isNumber":"4753760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747409","xplore-issue":"4753760","articleId":"4753827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4753833,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In this paper we investigate bit error rate (BER) performances of OFDM and WPM systems in the presence of carrier frequency offset and phase noise. BER is evaluated by means of computer simulations. In case of WPM several well-known wavelets such as Daubechies, Symlets, Coeiflets, discrete Meyer and biorthogonal wavelet are applied. The results of this research show how these wavelet-based systems cope with the frequency offset and phase noise in relation to OFDM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 European Conference on Wireless Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747409/4753760/04753833.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"169","publicationTitle":"2008 European Conference on Wireless Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Wavelet Packet Modulation and OFDM in the presence of carrier frequency and phase noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet packets","Phase modulation","OFDM modulation","Phase noise","Discrete Fourier transforms","Bit error rate","Intersymbol interference","Computer simulation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","phase noise","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet packet modulation","OFDM","carrier frequency offset","phase noise","multicarrier modulation technique","bit error rate","BER performances","Daubechies wavelet","Symlet wavelet","Coeiflet wavelet","discrete Meyer wavelet","biorthogonal wavelet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Wavelet Packet Modulation and OFDM in the presence of carrier frequency and phase noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753833/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415047","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Wavelet Packet Modulation and OFDM in the presence of carrier frequency and phase noise","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SPI-01132009-00073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052951S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747409","isNumber":"4753760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747409","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4753760","articleId":"4753833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4753841,"authors":[{"name":"Colin Sheldon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Sheldon","id":"37393357300"},{"name":"Eric Torkildson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Torkildson","id":"37393356100"},{"name":"Munkyo Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Munkyo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37418869300"},{"name":"C.

For an SRSRTask, the system searches the resource services that are qualified for its function requirements and chooses the optimal one to execute it. For an MRSRTask, in addition to the search for all qualified resource services according to each subtask, the system selects one candidate resource service for each subtask. Then the system generates a new composite resource service (CRS) and selects the optimal resource service composite path from all possible paths to execute the task with the given multi-objective (e.g., time minimization, cost minimization, and reliability maximization) and constraints. The above problem is defined as multi-objective MGrid resource service composition and optimal-selection (MO-MRSCOS) problem in this paper. The formulation is presented for an MO-MRSCOS problem to minimize execution time and cost, and maximize the reliability. The basic resource service composite modes (RSCM) for CRS are described, and the principles for translating a complicated RSCM into a simple sequence RSCM are presented for simplifying the resolving process and complexity of MO-MRSCOS. A new MGrid resource service composition and optimal-selection method, based on the principles of particle swarm optimization (PSO), is then proposed. The PSO follows a collaborative population-based search, which models based on the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. The case study demonstrates that the proposed method is useful in solving MO-MRSCOS problems. The experimental results and performance comparison show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2008.2009533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/4753889/04753893.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2008.2009533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Service Composition and Its Optimal-Selection Based on Particle Swarm Optimization in Manufacturing Grid System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753893/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Service Composition and Its Optimal-Selection Based on Particle Swarm Optimization in Manufacturing Grid System","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416722","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4753893/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Service Composition and Its Optimal-Selection Based on Particle Swarm Optimization in Manufacturing Grid System","sourcePdf":"tii-tao-2009533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100933S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"4753889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"4753889","articleId":"4753893","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4753934,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The SC-FDMA scheme considered in this letter employs an iterative multiuser detection using frequency-domain equalization (IMDFDE), which allows several users to share a common set of subcarriers. In order to improve spectral efficiency and guarantee QoS of assigned users, the proposed method chooses users by iteratively performing user selection. At each user selection for a set of subcarriers, the scheduler takes into account multiuser interference from previously assigned users of corresponding subcarriers and QoS constraint. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides higher spectral efficiency compared with round-robin and max-SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4753944/04753947.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2009.081445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2009.081445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-constrained opportunistic scheduling for sc-fdma with iterative multiuser detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multiple access interference","Frequency conversion","Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Quality of service","Interference constraints","Wireless communication","Long Term Evolution","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS","quality of service","constrained opportunistic scheduling","SC-FDMA","single-carrier frequency division multiple access","iterative multiuser detection","frequency-domain equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative multiuser detection, opportunistic scheduling, QoS, SC-FDMA."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"QoS-constrained opportunistic scheduling for sc-fdma with iterative multiuser detection","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4753947/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10416677","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-constrained opportunistic scheduling for sc-fdma with iterative multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"0004-cl0901-lim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052469S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4753944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4753944","articleId":"4753947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":4753949,"authors":[{"name":"Caihua Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Caihua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37652097000"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536681300"},{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280976800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4753949","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1228},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Broadcasting","Null space","Mobile communication","Diversity reception","Analytical models","Diversity methods","Iterative algorithms","H infinity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid zero-forcing beamforming","orthogonal beamforming","MIMO broadcast channels","multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast channel, multiple-input multiple-output, zero-forcing beamforming, orthogonal beamforming.

By further constructing orthogonal beamformers in the null space of the ZFBF user channels, it then employs OBF for the rest of users to fully exploit the spatial dimension.

Now, with microwave Doppler radar phase modulation, noncontact respiration and heartbeat monitoring offers an attractive alternative to commonly prescribed chest-strap monitors. Doppler radar uses double-sideband transmission for vital sign detection from four sides of a human body. An unmodulated radio-frequency signal is transmitted toward the human body, where it is phase-modulated by the periodic physiological movement and reflected back to the receiver. The radar receiver captures the reflected signal and demodulates it to extract the vital sign signal components.","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2008.930675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/4753970/04753999.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2008.930675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4753970","startPage":"47","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar remote monitoring of vital signs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4753999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radar remote monitoring of vital signs","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4753999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2009","accessionNumber":"10467106","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4753999/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar remote monitoring of vital signs","sourcePdf":"10mmm01-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065392S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"4753970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"4753970","articleId":"4753999","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":4754001,"authors":[{"name":"Songnan Yang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Songnan Yang","id":"37292119700"},{"name":"Chunna Zhang","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"],"lastName":"Chunna Zhang","id":"37288988900"},{"name":"Helen K.

(PA), having a more compact load network than that of the conventional Doherty amplifier, was designed and implemented for wide-band code-division multiple access (WCDMA) base-station applications. Its configuration and working principle are compared with the conventional Doherty amplifier. For experimental verification, we implemented an inverted Doherty amplifier, using a 190 W peak-envelope-power (PEP) laterally diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor (LDMOS) field-effect transistors (FETs). Using a four-carrier down-link WCDMA signal, we achieved a high power-added efficiency (PAE) of 32% and an average output power level as high as 46.3 dBm at a given adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) level of --30 dBc. This is a 9.5% improvement in efficiency and 1 dB improvement in output power under the same ACLR conditions from those of the balanced class-AB operation using the same

the current status of silicon based MMICs, it is possible to implement millimeter-wave SOC in silicon-based technologies that include the antenna, a medium-power amplifier, a transceiver, an LO (frequency synthesizer), and baseband circuits in a single chip. With certain interconnection schemes, such as flip-chip, to connect the chip to the substrate, it is also possible to integrate the best possible chips for a millimeter-wave communication system. Currently, CMOS is the best choice for the baseband circuits, while GaAs and InP MMICs can provide the best noise/power performance in the transceiver. High-efficiency antennas can be implemented directly on the packaging substrate. The SIP approach has the optimal combinations of the components for the best performance in a particular system. For example, a system in a package including CMOS baseband circuits, GaAs/InP-based transceiver, high-efficiency antenna, and high-power amplifier can achieve the best system characteristics. As we have discussed, the scope of SOC can be expanded along with more advanced MMIC fabrication technology and design techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4754004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10416029","htmlLink":"/document/4754004/","displayDocTitle":"MMICs in the millimeter-wave regime","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMICs in the millimeter-wave regime","sourcePdf":"10mmm01-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.339456S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"4753970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4753970","articleId":"4754004","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4755149,"authors":[{"name":"Neal Leavitt","affiliation":["Fallbrook, California-based international marketing communications company, Leavitt Communications"],"bio":{"p":["Neal Leavitt is president of Leavitt Communications (www.leavcom.com), a Fallbrook, California-based international marketing communications company with affiliate offices in Brazil, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, and the UK.

However, most protocols require a high computational cost in verifying the tagpsilas reply in the authentication server. This paper presents an efficient mutual authentication protocol using one-way functions only. In the proposed protocol, the authentication sever just needs to compute very limited times to find out the identifier of the RFID tag irrespective of the total number of the tags. Also, the response of the tag is changed in every authentication to avoid tag tracing. In addition, a challenge-response approach is performed to overcome tag cloning and replay attack. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is secure against eavesdropping, compromising attack, denial of service attack and other common attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4755226/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"10415844","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4755226/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient RFID Authentication Protocol for Low-Cost Tags","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient RFID Authentication Protocol for Low-Cost Tags","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3492b180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07708S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4755182","isNumber":"4755183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755182","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4755183","articleId":"4755226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4755240,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Security & Privacy, Enterprise Risk Service Deloitte, London, UK"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37656138600"},{"name":"Bruce Christianson","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Herfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Christianson","id":"37397457400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3492-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4755240","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4755240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Pervasive computing","Identity-based encryption","Authentication","Cryptography","Access protocols","Permission","Ubiquitous computing","Computer security","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","message authentication","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pervasive computing environment","domain-oriented access control","identity-based encryption access control","embedded computer device","security access policy","universal trusted infrastructure","cross-domain authentication mechanism","mobile resource access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domain-oriented access control","pervasive computing","identity-based encryption","revocation"]}],"abstract":"Pervasive computing envisions an environment in which we are surrounded by many embedded computer devices. Those networked devices provide us with a mobile, spontaneous and dynamic way to access various resources provided by domains with different security policies. The conventional approach to secure access over multiple domains is to implement a universal trusted infrastructure, extending local identity- or capability-based security systems and combining them with cross-domain authentication mechanisms. However, this does not adequately meet the security requirements of communicating with strangers in pervasive environments. This paper presents an intrinsically multi-domain oriented approach which incorporates an identity-based encryption (IBE) access control mechanism. This approach allows the right domain to get involved with its local playerspsila interactions by helping them to convert a token to a usable access capability, whilst facilitating revocation.","doi":"10.1109/EUC.2008.57","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4755182/4755183/04755240.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUC.2008.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4755183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Domain-Oriented Approach for Access Control in Pervasive Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4755240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Domain-Oriented Approach for Access Control in Pervasive Environments","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4755240/","accessionNumber":"10401417","volume":"2","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Domain-Oriented Approach for Access Control in Pervasive Environments","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3492b278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048706S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4755182","isNumber":"4755183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755182","xplore-issue":"4755183","articleId":"4755240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4755530,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Software development project failures using conventional SDLC are often attributed to project delays, resulting in budget overruns. On the other hand, a well planned and documented systems development project is more likely to result in a system that meets the expectations of both the intended users and the software engineers. This paper takes another look at conventional SDLC methodology by focusing on an aspect that is often overlooked in systems development practice, namely the significance of good documentation.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2009.167","publicationTitle":"2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/4755313/4755314/04755809.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4755314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2009.167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Documentation in Systems Development: A Significant Criterion for Project Success","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4755809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Documentation in Systems Development: A Significant Criterion for Project Success","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4755809/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10467088","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4755809/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Documentation in Systems Development: A Significant Criterion for Project Success","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"10-08-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063618S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4755313","isNumber":"4755314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755313","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4755314","articleId":"4755809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4755885,"authors":[{"name":"Jason S.

Waveguides with small bends may be formed allowing compact integrated photonic circuits to be formed. Full three dimensional (3D) photonic simulations are required in order to realize very low loss, integrated photonic crystal circuits. Needless to say, the design and fabrication of such fully 3D structures is challenging, and thus efficient simulation tools are necessary to identify the optimum structures for different applications. Researchers at the Department of Defense (DoD) and Arizona State University (ASU) have independently developed parallel Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) codes, with the goal of scaling up each simulator for complicated structures such as 3D optical integrated circuits (OIC). As the name implies, FDTD is a popular time-domain method for solving Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields. These two curl equations are solved explicitly in time over half-step intervals, where the values of one set of field values (e.g., electric fields) are used at the successive interval to solve for the other field (e.g., magnetic field) in a time marching fashion. In previously reported work, a fully parallel FDTD code scalable to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\n FDTD grid points was presented and showed good scalability up to 200 processors. The goal of our current work has been to realize a more optimized and efficient implementation requiring significantly less memory and scalable to thousands of processors. This requires both a scalable parallel FDTD code, as well as one with improved absorbing boundary conditions and more efficient algorithms to reduce runtime. The work and results discussed herein address both the scalability and the efficiency of the time-domain algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Parallel 3D FDTD Simulator for Photonic Crystal","publicationTitle":"2008 DoD HPCMP Users Group Conference","doi":"10.1109/DoD.HPCMP.UGC.2008.85","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 DoD HPCMP Users Group Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4755828/4755829/04755885.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DoD.HPCMP.UGC.2008.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4755829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4755885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4755885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improved Parallel 3D FDTD Simulator for Photonic Crystal","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4755885/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10428776","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Parallel 3D FDTD Simulator for Photonic Crystal","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3515a319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064734S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4755828","isNumber":"4755829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4755828","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4755829","articleId":"4755885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4755937,"authors":[{"name":"Dae-Hyung Park","affiliation":["Computer Science and Neuroscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Dae-Hyung","lastName":"Park","id":"37575779200"},{"name":"Heiko Hoffmann","affiliation":["Computer Science and Neuroscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37583638900"},{"name":"Peter Pastor","affiliation":["Computer Science and Neuroscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Pastor","id":"37542415600"},{"name":"Stefan Schaal","affiliation":["Computer Science and Neuroscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schaal","id":"37282144700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2821-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2822-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-0572"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-0580"}],"articleNumber":"4755937","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2464},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4755937","abstract":"Robots in a human environment need to be compliant. This compliance requires that a preplanned movement can be adapted to an obstacle that may be moving or appearing unexpectedly. Here, we present a general framework for movement generation and mid-flight adaptation to obstacles. For robust motion generation, Ijspeert et al developed the framework of dynamic movement primitives [1], [2], [3], [4], which represent a demonstrated movement with a set of differential equations. These equations allow adding a perturbing force without sacrificing stability of the desired movement. We extend this framework such that arbitrary movements in end-effector space can be represented - which was not possible before. Furthermore, we include obstacle avoidance by adding to the equations of motion a repellent force - a gradient of a potential field centered around the obstacle.

The watermark is embedded in the high frequency sub-band of the host image at coarsest level. Although the schemes based on SVD are robust but fail under ambiguity attacks. In this attack, both the owner and attacker can extract their watermark from the watermarked image. To prevent ambiguity, the normalized mass matrix is formed and embedded in the host image. In extraction, normalized mass matrix is extracted first and compared with original one. If the similarity is found then the singular values are extracted to construct the watermark. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is able to withstand a variety of attacks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Watermarking Scheme Based on Multiresolution Fractional Fourier Transform","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756033/4756034/04756045.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust Watermarking Scheme Based on Multiresolution Fractional Fourier Transform","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4756045/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10428786","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Watermarking Scheme Based on Multiresolution Fractional Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"3476a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062041S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756033","isNumber":"4756034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756033","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4756034","articleId":"4756045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4756047,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The second is a noise filtering phase where the disadvantage of taking vector median in a single color space is addressed and a new algorithm based on performing vector median first in RGB space and then in HSI space is presented. The results of simulations performed on a set of standard test images on a wide range of noise corruption show that the proposed method is capable of detecting all the impulse noise pixels with almost zero false positive rates and removes noise while retaining finer image details.

The use of such data in applications results in some artifacts and poor spatial resolution. Therefore, before being used, the data are to be interpolated onto a regular grid. One of the methods achieving this objective is based on the Fourier reconstruction, which deals with the under-determined system of equations. The Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP) is a recently proposed greedy algorithm. Compared to the other recent algorithms like l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n- minimization techniques, StOMP admits certain promising features such as faster and simpler implementation even in large scale settings. The present work applies StOMP to the Fourier-based interpolation problem for the signals that have sparse Fourier spectra. The basic objective is to verify empirically the performance of the algorithm if, and how far, the measurement coordinates can be shifted from uniform distribution on the continuous interval. Taking kurtosis as a quantifier for the deviation of distribution from being uniform, we show numerically that the measurement coordinates can be significantly shifted from uniform distribution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Interpolation","Coordinate measuring machines","Geophysical measurements","Image reconstruction","Equations","Large-scale systems","Seismic measurements","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier analysis","greedy algorithms","interpolation","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled data regularization","data interpolation","Fourier signal reconstruction","stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit","greedy algorithm","sparse Fourier spectra"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data regularization","incomplete data","l1 minimization","matching pursuit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.30","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756033/4756034/04756065.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularization of Incompletely, Irregularly and Randomly Sampled Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Regularization of Incompletely, Irregularly and Randomly Sampled Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756065/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4756065/","accessionNumber":"10415973","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularization of Incompletely, Irregularly and Randomly Sampled Data","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"3476a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072779S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756033","isNumber":"4756034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756033","xplore-issue":"4756034","articleId":"4756065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4756068,"authors":[{"name":"Juliana G.

Traditional fusion methods, such as IHS, PCA and Brovey, can reach good spatial resolution results, but often cause spectral distortion problems. In the literature, it is possible to find some image fusion methods using frequency domain processing, like wavelet-based fusion methods. Although they preserve good spectral information, their spatial visual effects are not satisfactory. IHS fusion method enhanced by Fourier transform presents good spectral and spatial resolution results, but limits the number of spectral bands used in the fusion process to three. In this paper, a method based on Fourier transform is proposed in order to obtain good spatial and spectral resolutions, without limiting the number of bands. In order to compare the spatial and spectral effects of this new method with those of IHS, IHS enhanced by Fourier transform and wavelet-based methods, IKONOS panchromatic and multispectral images were used as the test data. Quantitative measurements such as correlation coefficient, discrepancy and Mean Structural Similarity index were applied to evaluate the quality of the fused images. The results have shown that the new method can keep almost the same spatial resolution as the panchromatic images, and its spectral effect is well preserved.","doi":"10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.108","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756033/4756034/04756068.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fourier Transform-based Approach to Fusion High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756068/","displayDocTitle":"A Fourier Transform-based Approach to Fusion High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415975","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4756068/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fourier Transform-based Approach to Fusion High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"3476a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060799S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756033","isNumber":"4756034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756033","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4756034","articleId":"4756068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4756077,"authors":[{"name":"Pradipta Roy","affiliation":["Optronics Centre, Integrated Test Range, Chandipur, India"],"firstName":"Pradipta","lastName":"Roy","id":"37652709500"},{"name":"Prabir Kumar Biswas","affiliation":["Department of E&ECE, IIT, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Prabir Kumar","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37279685600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3476-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4756077","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Labeling","Automata","Image segmentation","Image analysis","Object segmentation","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Shape","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines","image segmentation","parallel machines","video signal processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel VLSI architecture","connected component labeling","finite state machine based cell network","binary video frame image","image segmentation","image analysis","real time video object segmentation","parallel dedicated hardware","seeded region-growing algorithm","XILINX FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Connected component labeling of a binary image is an indispensable task for image segmentation and analysis. For real time video object segmentation, total processing time to label all the objects of an entire image is critical as it is constrained by inter frame temporal difference. Parallel dedicated hardware is necessary to solve this problem in real time. In this paper we have proposed a parallel VLSI architecture for fast connected component labeling of a binary video frame image. We have adopted a seeded region-growing algorithm, which is implemented in a state machine based cell network. The design is verified in XILINX FPGA with real time video image data containing different objects with different shapes and sizes. The worst-case labeling time for a full video frame is 5 ms (using a 32 MHz clock), which is well below the required inter frame timing interval of 40 ms.","doi":"10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.50","publicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756033/4756034/04756077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVGIP.2008.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756034","startPage":"238","endPage":"243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Implementation of Fast Connected Component Labeling Using Finite State Machine Based Cell Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Implementation of Fast Connected Component Labeling Using Finite State Machine Based Cell Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756077/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415981","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4756077/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Implementation of Fast Connected Component Labeling Using Finite State Machine Based Cell Network","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"3476a238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041199S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756033","isNumber":"4756034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756033","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4756034","articleId":"4756077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4756134,"authors":[{"name":"Cem Direkoglu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Cem","lastName":"Direkoglu","id":"38551232800"},{"name":"Mark S.

Using the LPGF, at different scales, represents the inner and central part of an object more than the boundary. On the other hand using the HPGF, at different scales, represents the boundary and exterior parts of an object more than the central part. Our algorithms are also organized to achieve size, translation and rotation invariance.

Subsequently, based on this teleservice model, we introduce and analyse a multi-component based resource allocation scheme (MC-RAS) for call and traffic management that exploits the multi-component nature of multimedia traffic. Practical network parameters were used to evaluate the performance of the scheme as compared with the standard approach based on the single multimedia stream flow. The proposed scheme shows better performance in terms of reducing blocking probabilities.","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2008.95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2008.95","startPage":"492","endPage":"497","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services, and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756388/4756389/04756477.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services, and Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-component Teleservice Model for Multimedia Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-component Teleservice Model for Multimedia Applications","conferenceDate":"16-19 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4756477/","accessionNumber":"10416629","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756477/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-component Teleservice Model for Multimedia Applications","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"3333a492.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061124S","chronDate":"16-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756388","isNumber":"4756389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756388","xplore-issue":"4756389","articleId":"4756477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4756483,"authors":[{"name":"Jyrki Akkanen","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyrki","lastName":"Akkanen","id":"37087676499"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3333-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2897"}],"articleNumber":"4756483","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Delay","Streaming media","Scheduling algorithm","Protocols","Buffer storage","Paper technology","Testing","Smart phones","Network servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["media streaming","peer-to-peer computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous scheduling","data-driven peer-to-peer media streaming","network simulator","smart phones network","live video content","protocol","end-to-end delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["peer-to-peer","streaming","data-driven"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756483","abstract":"The paper introduces a new approach to data-driven peer-to-peer media streaming. While classical algorithms send buffer maps and run scheduling periodically, we experiment by continuously sending incremental notifications of buffer contents and by running a continuous scheduling process. The approach has been tested both in a network simulator and in a small network of smart phones with live video content. The protocol seems to adapt quickly to changing data rate or churn without producing intolerable overhead. The approach leads to small latency and strong peer equality and may thus ease neighbor management. The end-to-end delay is small and one may alleviate a need for large buffers.","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2008.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2008.33","startPage":"537","endPage":"542","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services, and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756388/4756389/04756483.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 The Second International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services, and Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Scheduling for Data-Driven Peer-to-Peer Streaming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Scheduling for Data-Driven Peer-to-Peer Streaming","conferenceDate":"16-19 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4756483/","accessionNumber":"10444603","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756483/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Scheduling for Data-Driven Peer-to-Peer Streaming","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"3333a537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091775S","chronDate":"16-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756388","isNumber":"4756389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756388","xplore-issue":"4756389","articleId":"4756483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4756489,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Toorani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology (lUST), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Toorani","id":"37660493400"},{"name":"A.

However, many optimization problems involve more than several hundreds decision variables, even one thousand. To deal with these problems, a fast cooperative coevolutionary particle swarm optimizer (FCPSO) is proposed, which is constructed based on cooperative coevolutionary framework and particle swarm optimizer with simple mutation operator. Simulation experiments on several benchmark functions from one hundred to one thousand decision variables are presented. FCPSO can solve these unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions while the function evaluations needed only linearly increase with decision variables. Therefore, FCPSO is a competitive optimizer for large scale and complex problems.","doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2008.165","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756503/4756504/04756533.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2008.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Coevolutionary Particle Swarm Optimizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation","Collaborative work","Genetic mutations","Large-scale systems","Conferences","Computational intelligence","Computer industry","Information science","Information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable coevolutionary particle swarm optimizer","fast cooperative coevolutioanry particle swarm optimizer","mutation operator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Coevolutionary Particle Swarm Optimizer","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4756533/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416083","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Coevolutionary Particle Swarm Optimizer","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3490a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064794S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756503","isNumber":"4756504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756503","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4756504","articleId":"4756533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4756534,"authors":[{"name":"Songfeng Lu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Songfeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37656325000"},{"name":"Chengfu Sun","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Chengfu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37655428300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3490-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4756534","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Quantum computing","Sun","Educational institutions","Testing","Convergence","Clustering algorithms","Probability distribution","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","quantum computing","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coevolutionary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","hybrid cooperative search","convergence","local optima","global optima"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization","Hybrid Cooperative Search"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2008.137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2008.137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756504","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756503/4756504/04756534.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coevolutionary Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization with Hybrid Cooperative Search","abstract":"Based on the previous introduced quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), in this paper, a revised novel QPSO with hybrid cooperative search is proposed.

With the help of the cooperative search among different swarms, hybrid cooperative quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (HCQPSO) makes the swarms more efficient in global search. The experimental results on test functions show that HCQPSO with hybrid cooperative search outperforms the QPSO.

A test image is first divided into overlapped blocks and extracted PCNN time signature as the detection features, which a two-dimensional image is projected to a one-dimensional feature space. The test blocks are matched to a face template, which can be a random face, not related to the test faces, based on Euclidean distance threshold. The candidate face blocks are clustered to determine the face number included in a probe image and the size of the face areas. Skin color segmentation is used to reduce the search areas and to speed up the detection procedure. The method demonstrates successful face detection over a wide range of facial variations in scale, resolution, facial expressions, with or without glasses, in the presence of various illumination conditions as well as under complex background from outdoor photo collections. The simulation result proves that the method is translation, rotation and scale invariant as well as insensitive to illumination changes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756603/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10416148","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4756603/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Color Face Detection Using Unit-Linking Pulse Coupled Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Face Detection Using Unit-Linking Pulse Coupled Neural Network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3490a466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056072S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756503","isNumber":"4756504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756503","xplore-issue":"4756504","articleId":"4756603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4756640,"authors":[{"name":"Yunpeng Xiao","affiliation":["College of Software, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yunpeng","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37632323500"},{"name":"Yang Tao","affiliation":["College of Software, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Tao","id":"37290453500"},{"name":"Qian Li","affiliation":["Department of Academic Affairs, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Li","id":"37632560900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3490-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4756640","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"abstract":"As most Websites are designed for desktop PCs, it is extremely uncomfortable to browse these large pages on a wireless handheld device with small screen and limited user interface. So it is necessary to adapt these web pages to small screen devices. Besides, as the limited computing ability and capacity of storage of wireless handheld devices, it is also extremely challenging to deploy existing Web page adaptation engine. By referring to huge computing ability and storage resource of cloud computing infrastructure, a new wireless web access mode is proposed. Firstly, the system framework is present. Subsequently, the two key components of system are described in detail: the one is distributed Web page adaptation engine, which is designed for the purpose that the engine can be carried by computing cloud distributed and parallel; the other is distributed Web page blocks management based on cloud computing, which is proposed so that the Web page adaptation engine can be deployed reasonably. Moreover, a prototype system and a set of evaluation experiments have been implemented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756503/4756504/04756640.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"649","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2008.18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2008.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756504","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Wireless Web Access Mode Based on Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Web pages","Engines","Handheld computers","Web page design","Personal communication networks","User interfaces","Concurrent computing","Distributed computing","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","peer-to-peer computing","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless Web access mode","cloud computing","Web sites","Web page adaptation engine","distributed Web page blocks management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New Wireless Web Access Mode Based on Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4756640/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416180","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Wireless Web Access Mode Based on Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3490a645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048298S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756503","isNumber":"4756504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756503","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4756504","articleId":"4756640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4756644,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Dongming","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Dongming","id":"37660447200"},{"name":"Xia Kewen","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Kewen","id":"37542097800"},{"name":"Wang Baozhu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Baozhu","id":"37298899300"},{"name":"Gao Jinyong","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Jinyong","id":"37086031768"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3490-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4756644","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"Genetic algorithm get local optimal solution too easily and converge slowly on selection problem of mobile IP routing, in order to solve the optimization problem, an approach based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) is proposed, the approach take advantages of quantum computation such as strongly parallel calculating abilities, global convergence and rapidly operating speed.

Complexity of algorithms based on large-scale neural network affects the practicability and real-time performance of control algorithms. A kind of MIMO decouple control system based on double-neuron adaptive predictive and static decouple algorithm was proposed. Algorithms of adaptive predicative controller based on neurons were expounded in detail. One neuron was used as adaptive controller and 3 input variables related with error were used. Gradient descent method was used in modifying weights in the neuron network. The other neuron was used as predictor.

Density tracking error and error variation are chosen as the input variables of fuzzy logic control, and triangle curves are used for the membership functions of the fuzzy variables. Nine fuzzy control rules are established, and genetic optimization procedures are designed to tune the PI parameters. Finally, the mix controller is simulated.

The proposed coding scheme allows for consistently higher error-protection level as the code rate decreases. It is also shown that whilst the lower code rates outperforms the higher ones, in terms of larger free distance and lower BER, the SNR range covered is narrower at decreasing levels of BER. This implies the potential bandwidth efficiency to be gained if the higher code rates are used for lower-priority data bits.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4756503/4756714/04756873.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"737","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application","doi":"10.1109/PACIIA.2008.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIIA.2008.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4756714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4756873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER Performance Analysis of V-BLAST MIMO System with Joint Source and Channel Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Performance analysis","MIMO","Channel coding","Convolutional codes","Error correction codes","Numerical simulation","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","convolutional codes","error statistics","MIMO communication","multiplexing","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error rate performance analysis","V-BLAST MIMO system","joint source-channel coding","rate compatible punctured convolutional code","unequal error protection","multiplexing gain","signal-to-noise ratio range","bandwidth efficiency","Vertical Bell Laboratories Space-Time system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel codes","convolutional codes","MIMO system","RCPC","UEP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4756873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"BER Performance Analysis of V-BLAST MIMO System with Joint Source and Channel Coding","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4756873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416373","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Performance Analysis of V-BLAST MIMO System with Joint Source and Channel Coding","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3490c733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060964S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4756503","isNumber":"4756714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4756503","xplore-issue":"4756714","articleId":"4756873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4756876,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Jinsha","affiliation":["Department of electronics and telecommunication Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Jinsha","id":"37641624200"},{"name":"Shi Hongmei","affiliation":["Department of electronics and telecommunication Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Hongmei","id":"37540433200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3490-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4756876","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","WiMAX","Frequency synchronization","Physical layer","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Conferences","Computational intelligence","Communication industry","Computer industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","synchronisation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified symbol timing synchronization algorithm","WiMAX OFDM systems","worldwide interoperability for microwave access","IEEE 802.16e-2005","IEEE 802.16d-2004","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency-offset"]}],"abstract":"Worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) is standardized in the IEEE 802.16e-2005/802.16d-2004, the physical layer of WiMAX is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation which is particularly sensitive to the timing synchronization.

The primary and secondary windings of the transcutaneous transformer are positioned outside and inside the human body, respectively. In such a transformer, the alignment and gap may change with external positioning. As a result, the coupling coefficient of the transcutaneous transformer is also varying, and so are the two large leakage inductances and the mutual inductance. Resonant-tank circuits with varying resonant-frequency are formed from the transformer inductors and external capacitors. For a given range of coupling coefficients, an operating frequency corresponding to a particular coupling coefficient can be found, for which the voltage transfer function is insensitive to load. Prior works have used frequency modulation to regulate the output voltage under varying load and transformer coupling. The use of frequency modulation may require a wide control frequency range which may extend well above the load insensitive frequency. In this paper, study of the input-to-output voltage transfer function is carried out, and a control method is proposed to lock the switching frequency at just above the load insensitive frequency for optimized efficiency at heavy loads. Specifically, operation at above resonant of the resonant circuits is maintained under varying coupling-coefficient. Using a digital-phase-lock-loop (PLL), zero-voltage switching is achieved in a full-bridge converter which is also programmed to provide output voltage regulation via pulsewidth modulation (PWM). A prototype transcutaneous power regulator is built and found to to perform excellently with high efficiency and tight regulation under variations of the alignment or gap of the transcutaneous transformer, load and input voltage.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2006492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4768995/04757208.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2006492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Control of a Transcutaneous Power Regulator for Artificial Hearts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4757208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757208/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Control of a Transcutaneous Power Regulator for Artificial Hearts","volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10417062","pubMedId":"23853160","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4757208/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Design, and Control of a Transcutaneous Power Regulator for Artificial Hearts","sourcePdf":"tbcas-tse-2006492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084728S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4768995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"4768995","articleId":"4757208","onlineDate":"20 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4757209,"authors":[{"name":"Slawomir Koziel","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Reykjav\u00edk University, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4777655/4757209/4757209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Slawomir Koziel (M'03\u2013SM'07) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland, in 1995 and 2000, respectively, and the M.Sc. degrees in theoretical physics and mathematics and Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland, in 2000, 2002, and 2003, respectively.","He was a Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

With the increase in the received SINR, the throughput for the MIMO schemes [e.g., space-time block code (STBC) and Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time (V-BLAST)] can be further improved. We also show, through several properties, that the proposed joint beamforming and power control can increase the received SINR of each receive antenna so that the average SINR can converge to the target SINR, which, in turn, implies that the throughput can converge to the throughput requirement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04757214.pdf","startPage":"3850","endPage":"3855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2013355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2013355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4757214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-Based Switching Between Diversity and Multiplexing in MIMO Systems With Cochannel Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interchannel interference","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Array signal processing","Power control","Receiving antennas","Switches","Block codes","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","MIMO communication","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput-based switching","MIMO systems","cochannel interference","multiple-input-multiple-output systems","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","space-time block code","Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time","V-BLAST","receive antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","multiplexing","space-time block code (STBC)","Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time (V-BLAST)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-Based Switching Between Diversity and Multiplexing in MIMO Systems With Cochannel Interference","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4757214/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829102","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-Based Switching Between Diversity and Multiplexing in MIMO Systems With Cochannel Interference","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2013355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124635S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4757214","onlineDate":"20 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4757217,"authors":[{"name":"Tharaka Dissanayake","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Tharaka","lastName":"Dissanayake","id":"37303531200"},{"name":"Mehmet R.

centralized approaches. In this paper, we propose a suite of protocols that achieve a distributed planning and routing scheme for MANETs. The proposed suite, which is composed of three protocols, offers scalability and extends network lifetime. The first protocol, i.e., the fast distributed connected dominating set (FDDS), constructs the virtual backbone by designing a fast distributed hierarchical algorithm that finds a connected dominating set (CDS) in the network graph. The constructed virtual backbone takes into account the node's limited energy, mobility, and traffic pattern. The second protocol, i.e., FDDS-M, proposes a distributed maintenance protocol that preserves the integrity of the hierarchical structure constructed by FDDS. The third protocol, i.e., FDDS-R, uses an intelligent path-selection fuzzy logic controller that can easily be incorporated in any existing link state routing protocol to select energy-efficient routes. We conducted extensive simulations that compare the operational properties (energy efficiency and network lifetime) of our schemes with others. The results show that our proposed schemes can achieve scalability and energy efficiency and outperform some of well-known approaches in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2013354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04757218.pdf","startPage":"3796","endPage":"3801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2013354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Efficient Network Planning and Routing in Large-Scale MANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4757218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757218/","displayDocTitle":"On Efficient Network Planning and Routing in Large-Scale MANETs","volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829103","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4757218/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Efficient Network Planning and Routing in Large-Scale MANETs","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2013354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067902S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4757218","onlineDate":"20 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4757224,"authors":[{"name":"Ugo Russo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4757346/4757224/4757224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ugo Russo (S'07) was born in Palermo, Italy, in 1981.

A new time-series method extended that frequency range with a factor of thousand or more. The new algorithm has two requirements to give useful results. First, at least ten closest pairs of neighboring irregular observations should have a distance less than the minimum resampling distance for the chosen discrete-time frequency range. Second, a low-order time-series model should be appropriate to describe the global character of the data. The consequences and importance of this second demand are studied for irregular turbulence observations with narrow spectral details. Models of low orders are estimated from equidistant hot-wire observations and from irregularly sampled laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) data, which are obtained from the same turbulence process. The irregular data are resampled with the nearest neighbor method, both with and without slotting. Apart from the usual bias contributions of resampling irregular data, LDA data can give an additional spectral bias if the instantaneous sampling rate is correlated to the actual magnitude of the turbulent velocity. Making histograms of the amplitudes and the interarrival times provides useful information about irregularly sampled data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4757225/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10560727","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Practical Aspects of the Spectral Analysis of Irregularly Sampled Data With Time-Series Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Aspects of the Spectral Analysis of Irregularly Sampled Data With Time-Series Models","sourcePdf":"tim-broersen-2009201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045825S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4812252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4812252","articleId":"4757225","onlineDate":"20 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4757263,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4785249/4757263/4757263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaguang Zhang (M'04\u2013SM'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering from Northeastern Electric Power University, Jilin, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in thermal power engineering and automation from Southeastern University, Nanjing, China, in 1991.","He was with the Automatic Control Department, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1992, as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

Both network-induced delay and packet dropout are concerned. In the developed control scheme, the FE is used to estimate the states of the controlled plant for the purpose of effectively reducing the network burden. Based on the limited knowledge of a controlled plant in the presence of a network, a disturbance attenuation term is also employed to attenuate the influence of modeling errors and external disturbances on the system.

Following the review, a new simple and accurate analytical switching loss model is proposed for synchronous buck VRs. The model includes the impact of common source inductance and switch parasitic inductances on switching loss. The proposed model uses simple equations to calculate the rise and fall times and piecewise linear approximations of the high-side MOSFET voltage and current waveforms to allow quick and accurate calculation of switching loss in a synchronous buck VR. A simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (Spice) simulations are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the voltage source driver model operating in a 1-MHz synchronous buck VR at 12-V input, 1.3-V output. Switching loss was estimated with the proposed model and compared to Spice measurements. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2007845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812314","startPage":"700","endPage":"713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812314/04757277.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Switching Loss Model for Buck Voltage Regulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4757277/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Practical Switching Loss Model for Buck Voltage Regulators","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586866","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Switching Loss Model for Buck Voltage Regulators","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2007845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10296S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4812314","articleId":"4757277","onlineDate":"20 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4757280,"authors":[{"name":"Soon Tat Kong","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812316/4757280/4757280-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soon Tat Kong was born in Sarawak, Malaysia, in 1980.

The maximum efficiency of the motor is obtained by the evaluation of optimal rotor flux at any operating point. In addition, the electromagnetic torque is also improved while maintaining a fast dynamic response. In this research, a novel approach is used to evaluate the optimal rotor flux level. This approach is based on PSO. This research presents two speed control strategies. These are field-oriented controller (FOC) and FOC based on PSO. The strategies are implemented mathematically and experimentally. The simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the FOC based on PSO method saves more energy than the conventional FOC method.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.2011831","startPage":"12","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4785258/04757297.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.2011831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4785258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency Optimization of Two-Asymmetrical-Winding Induction Motor Based on Swarm Intelligence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Particle swarm optimization","Rotors","Synchronous motors","Torque","Stators","Inductance","Equations","Mathematical model","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","induction motors","machine vector control","machine windings","particle swarm optimisation","rotors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficiency optimization","two-asymmetrical-winding induction motor","swarm intelligence","particle swarm optimization","speed control","optimal rotor flux","electromagnetic torque","fast dynamic response","field-oriented controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field orientation","inverter circuits","losses minimization control","mathematical model of the two-phase induction motor","motor losses","particle swarm optimization (PSO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency Optimization of Two-Asymmetrical-Winding Induction Motor Based on Swarm Intelligence","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4757297/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10475511","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency Optimization of Two-Asymmetrical-Winding Induction Motor Based on Swarm Intelligence","sourcePdf":"tec-hegazy-2011831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071247S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4785258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4785258","articleId":"4757297","onlineDate":"20 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4757299,"authors":[{"name":"Devis Tuia","affiliation":["Institute of Geomatics and Analysis of Risk, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Devis","lastName":"Tuia","id":"37395181300"},{"name":"Gustavo Camps-Valls","affiliation":["Departamento d Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Escola T\u00e8cnica Superior d Enginyeria, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Camps-Valls","id":"38274160900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4757299","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1037},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote sensing","Image classification","Kernel","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Hyperspectral sensors","Hyperspectral imaging","Pixel","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","image classification","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semisupervised support vector machine","remote sensing images classification","training kernel representation","cluster kernels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bagged and cluster kernels","image classification","kernel methods","support vector (SV) machine (SVM)"]}],"abstract":"A semisupervised support vector machine is presented for the classification of remote sensing images.

This simplification is based on a system-level protocol that decouples the intracore logic design from the design of the intercore communication channels. Each core is encapsulated within a shell, a synthesized logic block that dynamically controls its operation to interface it with the rest of the SoC and absorb any latency variations on its I/O signals. In particular, a shell stalls a core whenever new valid data are not available on the input channels or a downlink core has requested a delay in the data production on the output channels. We study how knowledge about the internal logic structure of a core can be applied to the design of its shell to improve the overall system-level performance by avoiding unnecessary local stalling. We introduce the notion of functional independence condition (FIC) and present a novel circuit design of a generic shell template that can leverage FIC. We propose a procedure for the logic synthesis of a FIC-shell instance that is only based on the analysis of the intracore logic and does not require any input from the designers. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental analysis that shows the performance benefits and limited design overhead of the proposed technique. This includes the semicustom design of an SoC, an ultrawideband baseband transmitter, using a 90-nm industrial standard cell library.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4757328/04757329.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.2009157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.2009157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4757329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Local Intracore Information to Increase Global Performance in Block-Based Design of Systems-on-Chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic design","Delay","Circuit synthesis","Design methodology","System-on-a-chip","Intellectual property","Protocols","Communication channels","Control system synthesis","Signal synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial property","input-output programs","logic circuits","protocols","system-on-chip","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip design","system-level protocol","intracore logic design","intercore communication channels","I/O signals","output channels","data production","local stalling","functional independence condition","circuit design","ultrawideband baseband transmitter","logic synthesis","intellectual property core"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite state machines (FSMs)","latency-insensitive design (LID)","logic synthesis","sequential logic optimization","system-level design","system-on-chip (SoCs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Local Intracore Information to Increase Global Performance in Block-Based Design of Systems-on-Chip","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4757329/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416698","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Local Intracore Information to Increase Global Performance in Block-Based Design of Systems-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"tcad-li-2009157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097127S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4757328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4757328","articleId":"4757329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4757337,"authors":[{"name":"Kristofer Vorwerk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada","Actel Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4757328/4757337/4757337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kristofer Vorwerk (S'02\u2013M'04\u2013S'04) received the B.A.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Kennings.","He is currently a Staff Software Engineer with Actel Corporation, Mountain View, CA.

Embedded logic analysis, which employs on-chip storage units to acquire data in real time from the internal signals of the circuit-under-debug, has emerged as a powerful technique for improving observability during in-system debug.

These issues pose threats to the success of a large-scale software project such as ERP. This research adopts a case study approach to examine how poor project management can imperil the implementation of an ERP system. Having learned the lessons from the failure of its first ERP implementation, the company in this case reengineered its project management practices to successfully carry out its second ERP implementation. Many critical project management factors contributed to the failure and success of this company's ERP system. This study explores and identifies critical elements of project management that contributed to the success of the second ERP implementation. For those organizations adopting ERP, the findings provide a roadmap to follow in order to avoid making critical, but often underestimated, project management mistakes.","doi":"10.1109/TEM.2008.2009802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/17/4757356/04757373.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2008.2009802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing ERP Implementation Failure: A Project Management Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4757373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Managing ERP Implementation Failure: A Project Management Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757373/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10401582","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4757373/","volume":"56","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing ERP Implementation Failure: A Project Management Perspective","sourcePdf":"tem-yang-2009802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123706S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"17","isNumber":"4757356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4757356","articleId":"4757373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4757375,"authors":[{"name":"Annette Muetze","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4757374/4757375/4757375-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Annette Muetze (S'03\u2013M'04) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, in 1999, the Dipl.-Ing. degree in general engineering from the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Ecully, France, in 1999, and the Dr.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from Darmstadt University of Technology in 2004.","In 2004, she became an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison.

This HF CM current can be significantly reduced by purpose-designed CM chokes that are inserted in the drive at the inverter output. This paper discusses scaling issues related to the design of such CM chokes, of both wound and feed-through toroidal types. The requirements for the design of chokes for these applications can differ from those for CM chokes designed for use in the inverter input, such as those used for the purpose of electromagnetic interference filtering. This difference is notably due to the comparatively large magnitude of the currents involved. The developed correlations allow taking full advantage of the possibilities offered by such chokes to reduce the HF CM current and mitigate the resultant parasitic effects. The discussed relationships are derived analytically, and the results are supported by measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.2009494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4757374/04757375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.2009494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757374","startPage":"286","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling Issues for Common-Mode Chokes to Mitigate Ground Currents in Inverter-Based Drive Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4757375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scaling Issues for Common-Mode Chokes to Mitigate Ground Currents in Inverter-Based Drive Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10401583","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4757375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling Issues for Common-Mode Chokes to Mitigate Ground Currents in Inverter-Based Drive Systems","sourcePdf":"tia-muetze-2009494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078662S","chronDate":"Jan.-feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4757374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4757374","articleId":"4757375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4757376,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Piippo","affiliation":["ABB Oy Company, Helsinki, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4757374/4757376/4757376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antti Piippo received the M.Sc.(Eng.) and D.Sc.(Tech.) degrees from Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","From 2003 to 2007, he was with Helsinki University of Technology, where he was a Research Scientist with the Power Electronics Laboratory.

This information is used for the adaptation of the motor parameters: At low speeds, the stator resistance is estimated, whereas at medium and high speeds, the PM flux is estimated. Small-signal analysis is carried out to investigate the proposed method. The convergence of the parameter estimates is shown by simulations and laboratory experiments.

Previous studies have highlighted the importance of providing adequate energy storage in order to compensate for deep voltage sags of long duration in weak systems. With the choice of flywheel as a preferred energy storage device, the proposed solution utilizes a single AC/AC power converter for the grid interface as opposed to a more conventional AC/DC/AC converter, leading to higher power density and increased system reliability. This paper develops the dynamic model for the complete system, including the matrix converter in dual synchronous reference frames coupled to the flywheel machine and the grid, respectively. The dynamic model is used to design a vector control system that seamlessly integrates functions of compensating load voltage and managing energy storage during voltage sag and idling modes. The numerical simulation and experimental results from a laboratory-scale hardware prototype are presented to verify system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757381/","volume":"45","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4757381/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10416041","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Voltage Restorer Utilizing a Matrix Converter and Flywheel Energy Storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Voltage Restorer Utilizing a Matrix Converter and Flywheel Energy Storage","sourcePdf":"tia-wang-2009507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101583S","chronDate":"Jan.-feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4757374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4757374","articleId":"4757381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4757400,"authors":[{"name":"Rajendra R.

In addition to power quality conditioning, the APF can also be used for bidirectional active power exchange with the three-phase four-wire grid and, therefore, acts as a multifunctional compensator. This paper presents a four-leg shunt multifunctional grid-connected power quality compensator. The compensator reference currents are generated using the instantaneous p-q-r theory. This paper proposes a simple modification to the conventional theory to eliminate the source neutral current from the three-phase four-wire power system. A digital controller is used to implement dead-beat current control. The outputs of the digital current controller are used as reference voltages for a 3-D space vector modulator (3D-SVM). A new approach for pulse width modulation waveform generation in 3D-SVM is proposed. All the intermediate steps are discussed from the viewpoint of implementation on a digital signal processor field-programmable gate array platform. The multifunctional compensator is analyzed, simulated, and tested experimentally for the most practical conditions in the power system, and the results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757400/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-feb.  2009","volume":"45","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10401593","publicationDate":"Jan.-feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4757400/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multifunctional Four-Leg Grid-Connected Compensator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multifunctional Four-Leg Grid-Connected Compensator","sourcePdf":"tia-chandorkar-2009704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094677S","chronDate":"Jan.-feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4757374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4757374","articleId":"4757400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":4757413,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Taniguchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Bioscience, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4757374/4757413/4757413-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shun Taniguchi born in Kagawa, Japan, on September 7, 1983.

In the communication system, sigma-delta modulation is employed to compress data and to transmit the signal over the transmission channels between the controller and the controlled plant. The current control loop is based on the deadbeat control method, and the space vector method is employed to fire the switches of a PWM inverter. Simulation results show that the proposed system can compensate the possible noise in the transmission channels. In addition, the current controller is implemented in field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

This system consists of a series of monodirectional and bidirectional switch. If one or several bidirectional power switches of this inverter burn out or to become ruined by reason an over voltage or depreciation, it stays in the previous level. Indeed, for a three-level NP to occur a defect in bidirectional switch (middle switch), this system operate in two level mode before detecting defect. In this inverter model, we increase the security and the reliability of the power switches. The originality of this inverter is to remove clamping diodes per phase in comparison with the classical multilevel inverter model neutral point clamped (NPC): e.g. for three phase of an inverter with n-level we removed 6.(n-2) diode-clamp. The advantage of delete all clamping diodes is to decrease the conduction losses. The other originality of this work is a simple command strategy with a low switching frequency. At the end we compare simulated and experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4757998/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415234","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new multilevel inverter model NP without clamping diodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multilevel inverter model NP without clamping diodes","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041573S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4757998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4757999,"authors":[{"name":"Salem Rahmani","affiliation":["Canada Research Chair in Energy Conversion and Power Electronics CRC-ECP \u00c9cole de Technologie Suprieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Salem","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"37294419300"},{"name":"Abdelhamid Hamadi","affiliation":["Canada Research Chair in Energy Conversion and Power Electronics CRC-ECP \u00c9cole de Technologie Suprieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Hamadi","id":"38562273600"},{"name":"Kamal Al-Haddad","affiliation":["Canada Research Chair in Energy Conversion and Power Electronics CRC-ECP \u00c9cole de Technologie Suprieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al-Haddad","id":"37274676300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4757999","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4757999","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive filters","Resonance","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Reactive power","Harmonic distortion","Phase distortion","Voltage","Topology","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","harmonic analysis","nonlinear filters","passive filters","power factor correction","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single phase hybrid passive filter","resonance damping","harmonics compensation","reactive power compensation","distorted source conditions","power factor correction","harmonics analysis","frequency response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid passive filter","Voltage and Current harmonics compensation","Power factor correction","Resonance damping"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new single phase hybrid passive filter (SPHPF) for compensating load voltage and current harmonics, correct power factor, eliminate the chances of series and parallel resonance and eliminates large variation of power factor and terminal voltage with varying loads under stiff and distorted source conditions. The harmonics analysis is performed in order to observe the percentage reduction of total harmonic distortion for passive filter at various loads. The investigations are carried out to validate the performance of proposed SPHPF with detuned resonance, for effective and efficient operation under varying loads and source conditions. The topology of SPHPF is chosen to shift the resonance frequency of the resulting system below 80 Hz where no excitation is expected. The frequency response shows excellent damping characteristic for load harmonic current above 80 Hz, which indicates that the hybrid passive filtering performance of this topology is satisfactory. Experimental and simulation results show that the proposed passive filter can simultaneously compensate effectively all voltage and current harmonics and reactive power for large capacity nonlinear load.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4757999","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04757999.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"478","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4757999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new single phase hybrid passive filter to dampen resonances and compensate harmonics and reactive power under distorted source conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new single phase hybrid passive filter to dampen resonances and compensate harmonics and reactive power under distorted source conditions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4757999/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415235","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4757999/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new single phase hybrid passive filter to dampen resonances and compensate harmonics and reactive power under distorted source conditions","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044976S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4757999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4758009,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelaziz Zouidi","affiliation":["Equipe de recherche: Signal, Image et Commande Intelligente des Systemes Industriels (SICISI), Universite de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Zouidi","id":"37294420200"},{"name":"Farhat Fnaiech","affiliation":["Equipe de recherche: Signal, Image et Commande Intelligente des Systemes Industriels (SICISI), Universite de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Farhat","lastName":"Fnaiech","id":"37270216400"},{"name":"Kamal Al-Haddad","affiliation":["Canada Research Chair in Energy Conversion and Power Electronics CRC-ECPE, Ecole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al-Haddad","id":"37274676300"},{"name":"Salem Rahmani","affiliation":["Equipe de recherche: Signal, Image et Commande Intelligente des Systemes Industriels (SICISI), Universite de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Salem","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"37294419300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758009","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758009","abstract":"Intelligent techniques of harmonic detection or estimation are nowadays of a great interest in power system applications, their ability to deal with high non-linearities attract researchers to investigate the performance of these methods mainly based on artificial intelligence namely using artificial neural networks (ANNs).

A three-branch inverter, two high frequency isolation transformers, two output high frequency cycloconverters and two low-pass filters, compose the basic topology. This architecture has the advantage that the inverter middle branch is common to both channels of the amplifier, without compromising the channel independency, and reducing the number of devices. The objective is to obtain a compact, high power density and reliable system. This Single Conversion Stage Amplifier topology integrates in a single unit both the power supply and the D-class amplifier, conferring to the total system direct and more efficient power conversion and compactness due to the component reduction. Since the amplifier outputs are totally isolated, modular operation is possible among several amplifier units or even between the two channels of a same unit. The amplifier output filter specifications could be relaxed because the principle of operation duplicates the equivalent switching frequency. Another advantage is that the output cycloconverters switch with zero voltage, reducing switching losses. The proposed topology is described and analysed, with emphasis in the principle of operation, modulation techniques and design criteria.

Indeed, to increase the generated power and therefore the efficiency of a marine current turbine, a nonlinear controller has been proposed. DFIG has been already considered for similar applications particularly wind turbine systems using mainly PI controllers. However, such kinds of controllers do not adequately handle some of tidal resource characteristics such as turbulence and swell effects. Indeed, these may decrease marine current turbine performances. Moreover, DFIG parameter variations should be accounted for. Therefore, a robust nonlinear control strategy, namely high-order sliding mode control, is proposed. This control strategy relies on the resource and the marine turbine models that were validated by experimental data. The sensitivity of the proposed control strategy is analyzed regarding the swell effect as it is considered as the most disturbing one for the resource model. Tidal current data from the Raz de Sein (Brittany, France) are used to run simulations of a 7.5-kW prototype over various flow regimes. Simulation results are presented and fully analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","startPage":"1228","endPage":"1233","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758130.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758130","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sliding mode control","Wind turbines","Power generation","Rotors","Tides","Induction generators","Torque","Inductance","Marine technology","Kinetic energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","marine systems","nonlinear control systems","PI control","turbines","variable structure systems","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode control","marine current turbine","doubly-fed induction generators","nonlinear control","speed control","PI controllers","power 7.5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Marine current turbine (MCT)","doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)","modeling","nonlinear control","high-order sliding mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-order sliding mode control of DFIG-based marine current turbine","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415457","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4758130/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758130/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-order sliding mode control of DFIG-based marine current turbine","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063112S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4758132,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Leidhold","affiliation":["Department of Power Electronics and Control of Drives, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Leidhold","id":"37293988900"},{"name":"Peter Mutschler","affiliation":["Department of Power Electronics and Control of Drives, Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Mutschler","id":"37293981500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758132","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":466},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Rotors","Switching frequency","Frequency estimation","Synchronous motors","Magnetic anisotropy","Voltage","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Hardware","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic anisotropy","permanent magnet motors","position control","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher dynamics","sensorless position detection","rotor position","PM synchronous motors","magnetic anisotropy","square wave carrier","switching frequency"]}],"abstract":"Numerous methods have been published for sensorless detection of the rotor position in PM synchronous motors (PMSM) by evaluating the magnetic anisotropy. In this paper, the one based on the injection of an alternating voltage carrier is considered. It is able to detect the anisotropy, and by its means the rotorpsilas position, without any additional hardware or modifications on the samplings times. It will be shown that the observerpsilas dynamics is bounded by the carrier frequency. The carrier is usually sinusoidal and with a frequency of about 1/4 of the switching frequency or lower. As a measure to improve the dynamics of the position observation, a square wave carrier with the highest possible frequency, namely the switching frequency, will be used. In addition, the carrier response will be decoupled from the controlled q-current in order to avoid the usual bandpass filter. This filter would introduce a significant delay in the observer loop. The frequency increase, together with the removal of the filter allows a faster time response in the position estimation. Experimental results showing the improvements in the estimationpsilas dynamics are presented.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758132","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758132.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758132","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved method for higher dynamics in sensorless position detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improved method for higher dynamics in sensorless position detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758132/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758132/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415459","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved method for higher dynamics in sensorless position detection","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053354S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4758139,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Hee Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hong-Hee Lee","id":"37292584100"},{"name":"Hoang M.

The proposed method relies on the continuous monitoring of the amplitude of the three output error voltages and works in a two-stage approach. In a first stage, if an open-circuit fault arises in the power converter, the error voltage associated with the output phase which contains the faulty element will rise considerably, hence triggering the indication of the fault. In a second stage, the exact location of the faulty element across the faulty phase will be done by monitoring the output error voltage of that phase when the reference input current and output voltage vectors lie within specific combinations of sectors, according to a table constructed for this purpose. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed diagnostic technique is effective in the detection and location of the faulty switch in a period of time as fast as one-eighteenth of the electrical period of the supply voltage of the converter and can be used independently of the type of load, both in steady-state and transient conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4758145/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415482","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Output error voltages - a first method to detect and locate faults in matrix converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output error voltages - a first method to detect and locate faults in matrix converters","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121371S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4758151,"authors":[{"name":"Anton Dianov","affiliation":["Digital Appliance Division, Suwon-City, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Dianov","id":"37670634100"},{"name":"Kim Young-Kwan","affiliation":["Digital Appliance Division, Suwon-City, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Kim Young-Kwan","id":"38273101900"},{"name":"Lee Sang-Joon","affiliation":["Digital Appliance Division, Suwon-City, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Lee Sang-Joon","id":"38272115300"},{"name":"Lee Sang-Taek","affiliation":["Digital Appliance Division, Suwon-City, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"lastName":"Lee Sang-Taek","id":"38270269900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758151","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Reluctance motors","Permanent magnet motors","Torque","Synchronous motors","Induction motors","Stators","Robust control","Rotors","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","machine control","permanent magnet motors","robust control","synchronous motor drives","torque control","tuning","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust self-tuning MTPA tuning algorithm","maximum torque per ampere control algorithm","IPMSM drives","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor drives","speed controller","current control loops","stator current command signal","maximum torque control reference frame"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents robust self-tuning maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control algorithm for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives.

Experimental results show that our system can provide enough accuracy for photogrammetry.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758222/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10415104","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758222/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Photogrammetric system using visible light communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photogrammetric system using visible light communication","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087895S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4758238,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Karungaru","affiliation":["University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Karungaru","id":"37274047200"},{"name":"Keiji Fukuda","affiliation":["University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37648143700"},{"name":"Minoru Fukumi","affiliation":["University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Fukumi","id":"37274047400"},{"name":"Norio Akamatsu","affiliation":["University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Norio","lastName":"Akamatsu","id":"37274064200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758238","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Image matching","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Frequency","Image sensors","Fast Fourier transforms","Image analysis","Fourier transforms","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint images classification","neural networks","automated fingerprint identification systems","fingerprint minutiae","fingerprint patterns","fingerprint verification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758238","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758238.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of fingerprint images into individual classes using Neural Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a classification system for fingerprint images that is based on the number of registered fingerprint persons. Most automated fingerprint identification systems use prior classification of fingerprint for improvement of efficiency verification using minutiae as features. However, methods that use fingerprint minutiae needs improvement because they are limited to the number of classable data. Therefore, many fingerprints are classified together, consequently taking a long time to match and verify a given fingerprint. In this work, we propose a system that classifies fingerprint patterns into individual classes. Instead of the classification using minutiae, we propose a classification system that is based on individual features and the number of registered persons. Efficiency verification improves because we donpsilat need to compare an input fingerprint image to all registered fingerprint images using this system. The proposed system carries out classification using neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758238/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10415146","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758238/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of fingerprint images into individual classes using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of fingerprint images into individual classes using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047657S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4758239,"authors":[{"name":"Rainer Bartz","affiliation":["Cologne University of Applied Sciences, Cologne, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Bartz","id":"37397143400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758239","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758239","abstract":"This paper describes a scalable XML-based approach to store data and configurations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the purpose of documentation and exchange between scientific and production tools.

LED light sources are finding more applications than conventional light bulbs due to their compactness, lower heat dissipation, real-time color changing capability and most importantly, long life which is much longer life than that of conventional offline power converters. Conventional power converters normally use high voltage electrolytic capacitors as energy storage element which could have the shortest lifetime when compared to other components of the LED lighting system. In this paper, a new isolated PFC power pre-regulator is proposed. The pre-regulator allows the charge storage capacitor to be positioned on the secondary side of the isolation transformer. Longer lifetime low voltage and high capacitance value capacitors can therefore be used to extend the overall lifetime of the LED lighting system. Steady-state state-space averaging analysis is preformed for designing the converter. A prototype converter is built to verify performance of the proposed PFC LED preregulator.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758260","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758260.pdf","startPage":"1980","endPage":"1987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Isolated PFC Pre-Regulator for LED Lamps","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758260/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415182","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758260/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolated PFC Pre-Regulator for LED Lamps","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053766S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4758270,"authors":[{"name":"Aldo Boglietti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Aldo","lastName":"Boglietti","id":"37267752100"},{"name":"Michele Pastorelli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Pastorelli","id":"37284212000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758270","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1606},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Induction motors","Synchronous motors","Rotors","Traction motors","Torque","Lamination","Temperature","Stator windings","Electric variables control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","synchronous reluctance motors","stators","rotors","power 2.2 kW","power 4 kW","voltage 380 V","frequency 50 Hz"]}],"abstract":"The aim of this paper is to investigate and compare the performances of two induction motors and two transverse laminated synchronous reluctance motors (induction motor nameplate data: 2.2 and 4 kW, 380 V, 50 Hz, 4 pole).

The comparison is focused on the loss, as well as on the technologies needed for each of these systems. The study shows that both AC and DC schemes can provide feasible solutions for off-shore applications. Specifically, it is shown through analysis and simulation, that DC distribution always results in lower loss for a given voltage level and a given transmission cable. In fact, depending on the voltage and cable parameters, the DC system loss could be as low as 15 to 50% of that of the corresponding AC system. The latter loss nonetheless could be reduced by the use of proper compensation at the expense of an increased complexity and cost. The study also shows that higher voltages are desirable for high power and long distance power distribution. This is advantageous for the AC scheme, which can readily use transformers at both sending and receiving ends, but represents a disadvantage for the DC case given that high-voltage DC-DC converters are a less mature technology. To this end, a modular converter topology is proposed that could be used for high voltage DC power delivery achieving a lower cost and size, better controllability, and higher reliability.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758283","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758283.pdf","startPage":"2113","endPage":"2118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ac vs. dc distribution for off-shore power delivery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758283/","displayDocTitle":"Ac vs. dc distribution for off-shore power delivery","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758283/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10428580","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ac vs. dc distribution for off-shore power delivery","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03275S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4758287,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Coupled-inductors are used in this topology to extend the duty cycle. Therefore, the low-voltage rated and low resistance devices can be applied to minimize the conduction which makes the conduction losses significantly reduced. ZCS turn-on is achieved by the intrinsic leakage inductance of the coupled inductors so that the switching losses are reduced and the power density can be improved. The clamp mode passive lossless snubber is applied in this converter which makes this topology less complicated and more reliable compared to those using the active-clamp scheme. The clamp circuit recovers the leakage energy and eventually releases to the load which improves the efficiency further. Due to the current decreasing rate of the output rectifier controlled by the leakage inductance, the diode reverse-recovery problem is alleviated. Furthermore, interleaved clamp mode makes the load current auto-shared by each phase without additional current sharing module needed. The experimental results based on a 48 V to 380 V DC/DC prototype verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Coupling circuits","Circuit topology","Inductance","Zero current switching","Inductors","Switching loss","Snubbers","Rectifiers","Diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductance","inductors","rectifying circuits","switching convertors","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved boost converter","passive lossless clamp circuits","coupled-inductors","duty cycle","conduction losses","ZCS turn-on","intrinsic leakage inductance","switching losses","active-clamp scheme","output rectifier","diode reverse-recovery problem","voltage 48 V to 380 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interleaved boost converter","winding coupled inductor","clamping capacitor","current auto-sharing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758289","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758289.pdf","startPage":"2149","endPage":"2155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing and analysis of an interleaved boost converter with passive lossless clamp circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Designing and analysis of an interleaved boost converter with passive lossless clamp circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758289/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758289/","accessionNumber":"10428581","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing and analysis of an interleaved boost converter with passive lossless clamp circuits","confLoc":"Orlando, FL","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05749S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4758312,"authors":[{"name":"Bill Kramer","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37655073200"},{"name":"Sudipta Chakraborty","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Sudipta","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37308016900"},{"name":"Benjamin Kroposki","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Kroposki","id":"37282841700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758312","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2453},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid electric vehicles","Battery powered vehicles","Power electronics","Internal combustion engines","Fossil fuels","Vehicle driving","Traction motors","Fuel cell vehicles","Electric motors","Petroleum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","hybrid electric vehicles","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plug-in vehicles","vehicle-to-grid capability","hybrid vehicles","vehicle batteries charging","power electronic system","IEEE Standard 1547"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758312","abstract":"As hybrid vehicles gain popularity among the consumers, current research initiatives are focused towards developing plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles that can exploit utility power to charge vehicle batteries and therefore less dependent on the gasoline usage.

The conventional power electronics converters used for such applications have two stages, a diode bridge rectifier at the front end followed by a dc-dc boost converter. However, the extremely low output voltage of electromagnetic microgenerators does not allow diode bridge rectification. Even if possible, the losses in the front end diode bridge make the conventional power electronic interfaces quite inefficient. The proposed single stage converters directly boost the microgenerator low ac voltage to usable dc voltage level, and hence, achieve higher efficiency. The single stage ac-to-dc power conversion is achieved by utilizing the bidirectional current conduction capability of MOSFETs. Moreover, for optimum energy harvesting the power converter should be able to control the load resistance as seen by a microgenerator. The conventional converters are not conducive for such control. With the proposed converter topologies the optimal energy harvesting can be successfully realized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10415281","htmlLink":"/document/4758319/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient direct ac-to-dc converters for vibration-based low voltage energy harvesting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient direct ac-to-dc converters for vibration-based low voltage energy harvesting","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044162S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4758331,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Three types of motor drive models are actually implemented on the FPGA card of the RT-LAB based real-time simulator used: a Park (d-q) model along with two different implementations of finite element analysis (FEA) based models. The first FEA model, previously published, is an FPGA implementation of a FEA model with an inductance calculation routine running on an associated CPU of the real-time simulator. The second FEA model has its inductance routine coded in the FPGA. One of the main objectives of the paper will be to compare the performance of the two FEA models. By virtue of the faster, FPGA-located, inductance routine update rate of the new model, it is expected that its precision at very high speed will be greater than the previous model, which was shown to be limited to 400 Hz electric frequency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very-high speed control of an FPGA-based finite-element-analysis permanent magnet synchronous virtual motor drive system","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758334","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758334.pdf","startPage":"2411","endPage":"2416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Very-high speed control of an FPGA-based finite-element-analysis permanent magnet synchronous virtual motor drive system","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758334/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10428595","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very-high speed control of an FPGA-based finite-element-analysis permanent magnet synchronous virtual motor drive system","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059353S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4758338,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

We propose a hardware architecture system; using Tiny Neural Networks (TNN) specialized in image recognition. The generic TNN architecture allows expandability by means of mapping several Basic units (layers) and dynamic reconfiguration; depending on the application specific demands. One of the most important features of Tiny Neural Networks (TNN) is their learning ability. Weight modification and architecture reconfiguration can be carried out at run time. Our system performs shape identification by the interpretation of their singularities. This is achieved by interconnecting several specialized TNN. The results of several tests, in different conditions are reported in the paper. The system detects accurately a test shape in almost all the experiments performed. The paper also contains a detailed description of the system architecture and the processing steps. In order to validate the research, the system has been implemented and was configured as a perceptron network with backpropagation learning and applied to the recognition of shapes. Simulation results show that this architecture has significant performance benefits.","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758340.pdf","startPage":"2445","endPage":"2452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of an image recognition system based on Tiny Neural networks and on-line reconfiguration","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of an image recognition system based on Tiny Neural networks and on-line reconfiguration","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415310","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4758340/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of an image recognition system based on Tiny Neural networks and on-line reconfiguration","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063066S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4758341,"authors":[{"name":"Ma Jesus Diaz","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Alcal\u00e1 University, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ma Jesus","lastName":"Diaz","id":"37656020100"},{"name":"Emilio Bueno","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Alcal\u00e1 University, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Bueno","id":"37270955400"},{"name":"Raul Mateos","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Alcal\u00e1 University, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Raul","lastName":"Mateos","id":"37293744700"},{"name":"Francisco J.

The Petri net model, which is defined on top of the well-known place-transition Petri nets class, and represented in compliance with the PNML format, is the common link across the set of tools already developed (beta versions). These include a graphical editor, automatic code generators for different target languages (namely C and VHDL), tools for model composition and model decomposition (to support the usage of co-design techniques), and a configuration tool (where reconfigurable platforms, like FPGAs, and microcontroller architectures are considered as implementation platforms). The usage of some of the developed tools is briefly presented using an automation system example, in order to obtain specifications for a set of distributed controllers, and deployment into an FPGA-based implementation platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758345.pdf","startPage":"2477","endPage":"2482","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Petri nets tools framework supporting FPGA-based controller implementations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Petri nets","Embedded system","Productivity","Databases","Signal generators","Prototypes","Programmable control","Design engineering","Application software","Software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","electronic engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","Petri nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Petri nets tools framework","FPGA-based controller implementations","R&D FORDESIGN project","place-transition Petri nets","C language","VHDL","model composition","model decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Petri nets tools framework supporting FPGA-based controller implementations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415313","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Petri nets tools framework supporting FPGA-based controller implementations","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042623S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4758381,"authors":[{"name":"Wilson Cesar Santana","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de g\u00e9nie \u00e9lectrique, \u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wilson Cesar","lastName":"Santana","id":"38367598200"},{"name":"Kamal Al-Haddad","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de g\u00e9nie \u00e9lectrique, \u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al-Haddad","id":"37274676300"},{"name":"Luiz Eduardo Borges da Silva","affiliation":["Departamento de Eletr\u00f4nica, Instituto de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade Federal de Itajub\u00e1, Itajuba, Minas Gerais, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luiz Eduardo Borges","lastName":"da Silva","id":"38182371400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758381","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Resonance","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Voltage","Active filters","Capacitors","Frequency","Harmonic analysis","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","compensation","damping","distribution networks","electric impedance","least squares approximations","parameter estimation","power system control","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["characteristic harmonic impedance estimator","active resonance damper","distribution feeder","harmonic resistance","parameter estimator","electric power system","auto regressive moving average least-square","integrator","external input","noise model","optimized current compensation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758381","abstract":"This work presents a control algorithm for an active resonance damper.

The performance of the PLL should not be much affected under distorted grid conditions: the presence of harmonics, unbalance, noise, etc in the inputs should not distort PLL measurements. This paper presents an optimized design approach of PLLs, both for single-phase and three-phase systems. The loop filter of the PLL sets its dynamic response; the loop filter should be tuned in order to achieve a correct tradeoff between transient response and harmonics/noise cancellation. This paper proposes the use of notch filters inside the loop in order to optimize the PLL performance; this approach is suitable both for single-phase and three-phase PLLs. Another novel interesting proposal of this paper is the implementation of the digitally controlled oscillator (DCO): the digital model of a sinusoidal oscillator is implemented, instead trigonometric functions. This reduces the needed digital resources without reducing the performance. This approach is specially useful for DSP-based control of power converters. The proposed PLLs have been implemented and tested in a fixed point DSP (TI TMS320LF2407) and also in a floating point microprocessor (PowerPC of the dSpace DS1103). The systems have been tested with different distorted inputs in order to check the validity of the design approaches and good results have been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758447","startPage":"3052","endPage":"3057","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758447.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust phase locked loops optimized for DSP implementation in power quality applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust phase locked loops optimized for DSP implementation in power quality applications","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758447/","accessionNumber":"10415479","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758447/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust phase locked loops optimized for DSP implementation in power quality applications","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044348S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4758450,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In these systems, the mechanical anomalies like load troubles, great torque dynamic variations and torsional oscillations, result in the fatigue of the shaft driving electrical machine and other mechanical parts as bearings and gearboxes. Then, the permanent on-site mechanical performance has to be evaluated to predict the residual life time of each mechanical part on the base of combined mechanical loads affecting them. In this way, this paper proposes an electromagnetic torque estimation using non invasive measuring as a mean for mechanical monitoring of torsional stresses. Different electromagnetic torque estimations can be obtained from the induction machine mathematical representation and the simplest one in term of implementation is proposed for grid or inverter-fed machines.

The analysis is focused on the closed loop frequency response and Nyquist plots for all current controllers of interest. The system stability when the active power conditioner attempts compensating high order harmonics is investigated. To perform this analysis, the time delay introduced by the inverter and the sampling is taken into account in the current controller closed loop transfer function. This procedure demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of the delay compensation to maintain the whole system stability. Experimental results obtained for a 25 kVA shunt active power conditioner prototype are presented to confirm the theoretical analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758463.pdf","startPage":"3141","endPage":"3148","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain analysis of resonant current controllers for active power conditioners","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Resonance","Stability","Delay effects","Frequency response","Power system harmonics","Performance analysis","Inverters","Sampling methods","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","electric current control","frequency-domain analysis","harmonics suppression","machine control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","resonant current controllers","closed loop frequency response","Nyquist plots","system stability","high order harmonic compensation","time delay","closed loop transfer function","delay compensation","shunt active power conditioner prototype"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain analysis of resonant current controllers for active power conditioners","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758463/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10415507","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-domain analysis of resonant current controllers for active power conditioners","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09252S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4758470,"authors":[{"name":"Alian Chen","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Alian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277937600"},{"name":"Chenghui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Chenghui Zhang","id":"37087148143"},{"name":"Hao Ma","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hao Ma","id":"37087195779"},{"name":"Yan Deng","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yan Deng","id":"37087254807"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1766-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4758470","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":690},"abstract":"To decrease the number of clamping diodes and flying capacitors in multilevel inverters, a novel multilevel inverter topology with no clamping diodes and flying capacitors is proposed in the paper. The topology structure, operating principle, balance of the DC link capacitor voltages, and comparisons with the conventional multilevel topologies will be discussed. The number of power switching devices needed is same as the conventional multilevel inverters, i.e. 2(M-1) for an M-level single-phase inverter. With no clamping diodes and flying capacitors, the reliability is improved and the costs are saved. But two of the switching devices will block double of one DC link capacitor voltages at some voltage levels. So this novel topology is more suitable for medium voltage applications with low THD requirements. By using the method of hybrid clamped, the DC link capacitors can be balanced with easy control. Its validity is confirmed by simulations and experiments based on a five level inverter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Topology","Clamps","Diodes","Capacitors","Voltage","Leg","Stress","Power engineering and energy","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","harmonic distortion","invertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel inverter topology","topology structure","DC link capacitor voltages","power switching devices","THD requirements","five level inverter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2008.4758470","publicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 34th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749247/4757911/04758470.pdf","startPage":"3184","endPage":"3187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2008.4758470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel multilevel inverter topology with no clamping diodes and flying capacitors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel multilevel inverter topology with no clamping diodes and flying capacitors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758470/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758470/","accessionNumber":"10415529","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel multilevel inverter topology with no clamping diodes and flying capacitors","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162009-00559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046874S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749247","isNumber":"4757911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749247","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4757911","articleId":"4758470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4758473,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago A.

We directly compare two possible approaches: (i) detection through a simple ldquobrute-forcerdquo state-complexity reduction strategy and (ii) a more structured reduced-state sequence detection (RSSD) strategy. The performance of both state-complexity reduction techniques is evaluated considering two realistic optical transmission schemes, based on on-off keying (OOK) and optical duobinary modulation (ODBM), respectively. The detection algorithms are characterized considering the impact of the timing offset, the quantization scheme, and the amount of uncompensated CD. As one would expect, for a given number of states in MLSD receivers, the schemes based on RSSD exhibit better performance with respect to those based on simple brute-force state-complexity reduction. However, we show that MLSD schemes based on the use of brute-force state-complexity reduction are characterized by a better complexity/performance trade-off for low/medium CD values, whereas RSSD is the best choice for high CD values.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State-Complexity Reduction in MLSD Receivers for Optical Communications With Direct Photodetection","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.917319","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4758635/04758637.pdf","startPage":"3497","endPage":"3508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.917319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4758635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.1,  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2008","displayDocTitle":"State-Complexity Reduction in MLSD Receivers for Optical Communications With Direct Photodetection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"21","htmlLink":"/document/4758637/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2008","accessionNumber":"10429204","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-Complexity Reduction in MLSD Receivers for Optical Communications With Direct Photodetection","sourcePdf":"26jlt21-franceschini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199166S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4758635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4758635","articleId":"4758637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4758640,"authors":[{"name":"Veronica Toccafondo","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4758635/4758640/4758640-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Veronica Toccafondo was born in Turnhout, Belgium, in 1979.

The scheme is based on evanescent pump light coupling from a multimode low loss waveguide to a single mode active core. Multimode pump light is gradually coupled to the active waveguide, which is single mode at the signal wavelengths, providing population inversion along the whole amplifier length and overcoming the main limitation of conventional single mode pump butt-coupling in case of strongly absorbing active materials. We propose this pumping scheme at 477 nm for Si-nanocluster sensitized Erbium doped waveguide amplifiers, in which conventional butt-coupling is inefficient due to the strong pump absorption by the Si- nanoclusters , and top pumping by LED arrays is limited by the low pump intensity values achievable within the active region. The coupling between the multimode waveguide and the active core has been numerically studied for slab waveguide structures using a 2-D split-step finite element method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.1,  2008","htmlLink":"/document/4758640/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2008","accessionNumber":"10459846","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evanescent Multimode Longitudinal Pumping Scheme for Si-Nanocluster Sensitized Er<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$^{3+}$</tex> </formula>-Doped Waveguide Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evanescent Multimode Longitudinal Pumping Scheme for Si-Nanocluster Sensitized Er<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$^{3+}$</tex> </formula>-Doped Waveguide Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"26jlt21-toccafondo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06628S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4758635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4758635","articleId":"4758640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4758646,"authors":[{"name":"Yaguang Yang","affiliation":["Orbital Sciences Corporation, Dalles, VA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yaguang Yang received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from the Control Engineering Department, Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Electrical Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, in 1996.","He is a senior principal GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) engineer at Orbital Sciences Corporation.

Due to the square-law nonlinearity and its interaction with the linear pre- and postfilters, the understanding of this seemingly simple structure has been elusive, gradually evolving over a succession of studies, culminating in the models by Lee and Shim and Forestieri. Here we adopt a new approach to this old problem, applying Volterra nonlinear theory to obtain fresh insight deriving a simplified model streamlining the pseudoanalytic simulations. Volterra series is a powerful mathematical tool for simulating nonlinear systems, applied here to quadratic optical detection in an unconventional way, by deriving a mixed frequency-time representation, leading to a simple and compact quadratic form in the combined signal-plus-noise signal spectra, albeit not computationally efficient. Next, Forestieri's results, which used distinct bases for the signal and noise, are rederived using the insightful Volterra formalism. Finally, we reformulate the model using an expansion of both signal and noise in a common harmonic basis over a sliding window of duration equal to the ISI system memory. This final version of the optically amplified receiver model is most computationally efficient, provides the most compact description, and lends itself to intuitive interpretation. Applications of the new method include accurate determination of the bit error ratio of amplitude-shift keying, frequency-shift keying, and differential phase-shift keying transmission systems in the linear optical link propagation regime, including the effects of dispersion and fully accounting for intersymbol interference. The theory developed here is naturally extensible to advanced optical equalization techniques, involving Volterra nonlinear optoelectronic equalizers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Optical detectors","Optical receivers","Nonlinear optics","Optical noise","Computational modeling","Power system modeling","Optical computing","Intersymbol interference","Preamplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","differential phase shift keying","error statistics","frequency shift keying","intersymbol interference","nonlinear filters","nonlinear optics","optical filters","optical links","optical noise","optical receivers","photodetectors","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optically amplified receiver","optical preamplifier","optical prefilter","photodetector","electrical postfilter","square-law nonlinearity","Volterra nonlinear theory","pseudoanalytic simulations","Volterra series","quadratic optical detection","signal-plus-noise signal spectra","bit error ratio","amplitude-shift keying transmission systems","frequency-shift keying transmission systems","differential phase-shift keying transmission systems","linear optical link propagation regime","dispersion effects","intersymbol interference","optical equalization techniques","Volterra nonlinear optoelectronic equalizers","optical amplification","optical communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude-shift keying","bit error ratio","electrical postdetection filter","electronic equalization","intersymbol interference","optical amplification","optical communication","optical filter","power spectrum","Volterra series"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.925031","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4758647/04758655.pdf","startPage":"3677","endPage":"3693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4758647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.925031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optically Amplified Direct Detection With Pre- and Postfiltering: A Volterra Series Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optically Amplified Direct Detection With Pre- and Postfiltering: A Volterra Series Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758655/","volume":"26","issue":"22","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4758655/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10444881","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.15,  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optically Amplified Direct Detection With Pre- and Postfiltering: A Volterra Series Approach","sourcePdf":"26jlt22-nazarathy3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090281S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4758647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4758647","articleId":"4758655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4758657,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Hao Tien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4758647/4758657/4758657-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Hao Tien received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C, in 2005, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interests include optical communications and wireless communications."]},"firstName":"Jen-Hao","lastName":"Tien","id":"37648898300"},{"name":"Guu-Chang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4758647/4758657/4758657-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Guu-Chang Yang (S'88\u2013M'92\u2013SM'05) received the B.S. degree from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1985 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, in 1989 and 1992, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 1988 to 1992, he was a Research Assistant with the System Research Center, University of Maryland.

The system has been accurately analyzed taking into account the presence of optical amplifier spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, electronic receiver noise, photodiode shot-noise and also multiple access interference (MAI). The application of optical tapped-delay lines in the receiver as the CDMA-decoder has also been investigated. In terms of spreading code, a newly introduced prime code family named as double-padded modified prime code has been utilized. A comprehensive set of results in the literatures showed that the performance of the binary system is approximately 3 dB better than intensity modulations. Therefore, in our following proposed transceiver architecture we have also employed binary Pol-SK modulation. Our results indicate that the proposed architecture consumes less power while enhances the system capacity. Moreover, since the optical beam power is constant, the system has immunity against the self- and cross-phase modulations. Above all, the polarization-based scheme is more promising for very-long-haul high-speed transmissions over the OCDMA networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver Architecture for Incoherent Optical CDMA Networks Based on Polarization Modulation","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.928523","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4758661/04758668.pdf","startPage":"3820","endPage":"3828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.928523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4758661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4758668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4758668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.15,  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2008","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver Architecture for Incoherent Optical CDMA Networks Based on Polarization Modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/4758668/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2008","accessionNumber":"10444889","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transceiver Architecture for Incoherent Optical CDMA Networks Based on Polarization Modulation","sourcePdf":"26jlt24-karbassian3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065775S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4758661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4758661","articleId":"4758668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4759628,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4759625/4759628/4759628-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Wang received the PhD degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2004.

One of the major problems in cluster analysis is the determination of the number of clusters in unlabeled data, which is a basic input for most clustering algorithms. In this paper we investigate a new method called DBE (dark block extraction) for automatically estimating the number of clusters in unlabeled data sets, which is based on an existing algorithm for visual assessment of cluster tendency (VAT) of a data set, using several common image and signal processing techniques. Basic steps include: 1) generating a VAT image of an input dissimilarity matrix; 2) performing image segmentation on the VAT image to obtain a binary image, followed by directional morphological filtering; 3) applying a distance transform to the filtered binary image and projecting the pixel values onto the main diagonal axis of the image to form a projection signal; 4) smoothing the projection signal, computing its first-order derivative, and then detecting major peaks and valleys in the resulting signal to decide the number of clusters. Our new DBE method is nearly \"automatic\", depending on just one easy-to-set parameter. Several numerical and real-world examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of DBE.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2008.158","startPage":"335","endPage":"350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4759625","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4759625/04759628.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically Determining the Number of Clusters in Unlabeled Data Sets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4759628/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatically Determining the Number of Clusters in Unlabeled Data Sets","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4759628/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10416751","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically Determining the Number of Clusters in Unlabeled Data Sets","sourcePdf":"ttk2009030335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100247S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4759625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4759625","articleId":"4759628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
