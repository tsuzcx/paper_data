This summary points out an important defect of FM discriminators which affects the data accuracy of the telemeter but which is rarely recognized. The system study deals with generalized optimum filtering for transient signals applicable to commutated signals and operators such as discrimination. The solution for particular applications with respect to the phase-locked loop or optimum-demodulation system is offered. With these applications available, noise and transient signals are studied to see how the system fits the practical system. Normalized charts are made which may be applied to any standard telemetering channel that may be designed. A comparison of this system with ordinary discriminators shows a large threshold improvement and a reduction in over-all system error. Graphs of the comparison of these effects are also included.

In this paper, we first identify and formalize a new attack, in which the attacker could exploit the information about the presence or absence of a specific person to infer his meter readings. This attack, coined as human-factor-aware differential aggregation (HDA) attack, cannot be addressed in existing privacy-preserving aggregation protocols proposed for smart grids. We give a formal definition on it and propose two novel protocols, including basic scheme and advanced scheme, to achieve privacy-preserving smart metering data aggregation and to resist the HDA attack. Our protocol ensures that smart meters periodically upload encrypted measurements to a (electricity) supplier/aggregator such that the aggregator is able to derive the aggregated statistics of all meter measurements but is unable to learn any information about the human activities. We present the formal security analysis for the proposed protocol to guarantee the strong privacy. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of our protocol in a Java-based implementation under different parameters. The performance and utility analysis shows that our protocol is simple, efficient, and practical.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/6819870/06541956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819870","startPage":"598","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-Factor-Aware Privacy-Preserving Aggregation in Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6541956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Human-Factor-Aware Privacy-Preserving Aggregation in Smart Grid","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6541956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331795","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6541956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61033014, 60970110, 60972034, 61 003218 and 61272444"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China A3 Foresight Program","grantNumber":"61161140320"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Fund of the Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20100073120065"},{"fundingName":"National Fundamental Research Development Program of China (973)","grantNumber":"2012CB723401"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-Factor-Aware Privacy-Preserving Aggregation in Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"jsyst-cao-2260937-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121313S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6819870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6819870","articleId":"6541956","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6541958,"authors":[{"name":"Ravinder S.

The cost effective chemical etching is adopted for wafer thinning and the transfer printing approach, to transfer quasi 1-D structures such as micro/nanoscale wires and ribbons, that is adapted for transferring large ultra-thin flex-chips (widths 4.5-15 mm, lengths 8-36 mm, and thickness \u2248 15 \u03bcm). The post-processing capability is demonstrated with passive structures such as metal interconnects realized on the flex-chips before carrying out the chip thinning step. The resistance values of metal interconnects do not show any appreciable change because of bending of chips for the tested range viz., radius of curvature 9 mm and above. Further, the bending mechanics of silicon membranes on foil is investigated to evaluate the bending limits before a mechanical fracture/failure occurs. The distinct advantages of this paper are: attaining bendability through post-processing of chips, cost effective fabrication process, and easy transfer of chips to the flexible substrates without using conventional and sophisticated equipment such as pick and place set up.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2269028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6583958/06541958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2269028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583958","startPage":"4030","endPage":"4037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bendable Ultra-Thin Chips on Flexible Foils","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6541958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bendable Ultra-Thin Chips on Flexible Foils","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6541958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13748105","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6541958/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bendable Ultra-Thin Chips on Flexible Foils","sourcePdf":"jsen-dahiya-2269028-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079004S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6583958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6583958","articleId":"6541958","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6541970,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Martin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6714460/6541970/6541970-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Martin was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1986.

A multilayer codebook-based background subtraction (MCBS) model is proposed for video sequences to detect moving objects. Combining the multilayer block-based strategy and the adaptive feature extraction from blocks of various sizes, the proposed method can remove most of the nonstationary (dynamic) background and significantly increase the processing efficiency. Moreover, the pixel-based classification is adopted for refining the results from the block-based background subtraction, which can further classify pixels as foreground, shadows, and highlights. As a result, the proposed scheme can provide a high precision and efficient processing speed to meet the requirements of real-time moving object detection.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2269011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2269011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6615982/06541979.pdf","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6615982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6541979/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Fast Background Subtraction Based on a Multilayer Codebook Model for Moving Object Detection","volume":"23","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13797072","htmlLink":"/document/6541979/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Background Subtraction Based on a Multilayer Codebook Model for Moving Object Detection","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-juo-2269011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094264S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6615982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6615982","articleId":"6541979","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6541983,"authors":[{"name":"Milad Falahi","affiliation":["Consulting and Analysis Group, Itron, Inc., Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/6589217/6541983/6541983-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Milad Falahi (S'06\u2013M'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from K.

As a result, EV charging will put an extra burden on the distribution grid and adjustments need to be made in some cases. On the other hand, EVs have the potential to support the grid as well. This paper presents a single-phase bidirectional charger topology which pairs up a photovoltaic (PV) source with an EV charger resulting in production cost reduction. The presented topology is then used for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. The main focus of this paper is on power quality services which only slightly discharge the battery. Among these services, it studies the possibility of local reactive injection of EVs connected to the grid through a single-phase charger to compensate for voltage drops caused by motor startup or inductive loads. It also studies the possibility of active power injection of EVs for short time periods during PV transients in cloudy weather to keep the system stable. It also studies the potential of EVs to help during low voltage ride-through of the PV sources. The studies are performed using Simulink simulations and a real-time implementation in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of power quality V2G services with small wear on the EV battery.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Potential Power Quality Benefits of Electric Vehicles","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2013.2263848","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/6589217/06541983.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2013.2263848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6589217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6541983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6541983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Potential Power Quality Benefits of Electric Vehicles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6541983/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13778323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential Power Quality Benefits of Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tste-falahi-2263848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088753S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"6589217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6589217","articleId":"6541983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6541985,"authors":[{"name":"Wasim Huleihel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6588613/6541985/6541985-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wasim Huleihel received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in 2012 and 2013, respectively.","Currently, he is working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the Technion Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

The permeability and the permittivity of a toroidal test sample are determined by measuring the reflection coefficients of a shorted coaxial transmission line and by using Newton's minimization algorithm. The permeabilities of two samples with different concentrations of cobalt nanoparticles are measured, and the validity of the shorted transmission line method is confirmed by comparing the results to a two-port transmission line approach. The sensitivity of the shorted line method to different measurement parameters is investigated in detail, and the connection between the spatial dimensions of the sample and the measurement uncertainty is studied. The bandwidth of the method is limited by the cavity resonance at the upper end of the frequency range and by the reduction of the sensitivity at the lower end. This is important because in magnetic materials research the sample sizes are generally small, which sets a limit to the lowest measurement frequency using transmission line methods. The reduction in sensitivity is demonstrated by measuring the permeability of three Teflon samples (each having different lengths), and by developing a theoretical model for the measurement errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6541988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6541988/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13697393","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measuring the Microwave Magnetic Permeability of Small Samples Using the Short-Circuit Transmission Line Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring the Microwave Magnetic Permeability of Small Samples Using the Short-Circuit Transmission Line Method","sourcePdf":"tim-vepsalainen-2259111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051151S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6576154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6576154","articleId":"6541988","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542004,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["Graduate University for Advanced Studies, National Institute of Informatics, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6615982/6542004/6542004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi Liu (S'11) received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from the University of Science and Technology of China, Anhui, China, in 2009.

Previous IMVS works focus on efficient compression techniques that facilitate interactive view switching. In this paper, in addition to the loss-resilient aspect during network streaming we address how to design efficient coding tools and optimize frame structure for transmission to facilitate view switching and contain error propagation in differentially coded video due to packet losses. We first design a new unified distributed source coding (uDSC) frame-a new coding tool that simultaneously offers view switching and loss-resilient capabilities-for periodic insertion into the multiview frame structure. After inserting uDSC-frames into the coding structure, we schedule packets for network transmission in a rate-distortion optimal manner for both wireless multicast and wired unicast streaming scenarios. For wireless multicast over a Gilbert-Elliott loss model, frames in a group of pictures are packetized and reordered, so that uDSC frames are correctly decoded with high probability, mitigating error propagation. For wired unicast, we use a Markov decision process to optimize packet transmission to minimize expected distortion given a bandwidth constraint. Experimental results show that systems that insert uDSC frames and optimize packet transmission can outperform other competing coding schemes by up to 2.8 and 11.6 dB in wireless multicast and wired unicast streaming scenarios, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2269019","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6615982/06542004.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2269019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6615982","startPage":"1781","endPage":"1794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Distributed Source Coding for Interactive Multiview Video Streaming Over Lossy Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Distributed Source Coding for Interactive Multiview Video Streaming Over Lossy Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13797069","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542004/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Distributed Source Coding for Interactive Multiview Video Streaming Over Lossy Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-liu-2269019-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127794S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6615982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6615982","articleId":"6542004","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6542009,"authors":[{"name":"Ruili Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6583962/6542009/6542009-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruili Wu (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2010.

A pseudo-differential power amplifier (PA) is designed using two integrated SiGe power cells fabricated in a 0.35- \u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS technology with through-silicon-via (TSV). In the continuous-wave (CW) measurement, the PA achieves a saturated output power (POUT) of around 2 W with power-added efficiency (PAE) above 65% across the bandwidth of 0.7-1.0 GHz. To optimize the ET-PA system performance, several envelope shaping methods such as dc shifting, envelope scaling, envelope clipping, and envelope attenuation at back-off have been investigated carefully. A highly efficient monolithic CMOS envelope modulator (EM) integrated circuit (IC) is designed in a 0.35- \u03bcm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process to mate with our SiGe PA. With the LTE 16 QAM 5/10/20-MHz input signals, our ET-PA system achieves around 28 dBm linear POUT, passing the stringent LTE linearity specs such as the spectrum emission mask with an average composite system PAE of 42.3%/41.1%/40.2%, respectively. No predistortion is applied in this work.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6583962/06542009.pdf","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2265501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2265501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Silicon-Based Envelope-Tracking Power Amplifier Design With Envelope Shaping for Broadband Wireless Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","Through-silicon vias","Linearity","Radio frequency","Gain","Modulation","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","bipolar MMIC","differential amplifiers","field effect MMIC","Ge-Si alloys","Long Term Evolution","modulators","three-dimensional integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["envelope tracking power amplifier","envelope shaping","broadband wireless application","pseudodifferential power amplifier","power cell","BiCMOS technology","through silicon via","continuous wave measurement","saturated output power","DC shifting","envelope scaling","envelope clipping","envelope attenuation","monolithic CMOS envelope modulator","bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process","LTE 16 QAM input signal","frequency 0.7 GHz to 1 GHz","size 0.35 mum","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Envelope-tracking (ET)","envelope modulator (EM)","envelope shaping method","long-term evolution (LTE)","SiGe power amplifier (SiGe PA)","through-silicon-via (TSV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Silicon-Based Envelope-Tracking Power Amplifier Design With Envelope Shaping for Broadband Wireless Applications","volume":"48","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6542009/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13747604","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Silicon-Based Envelope-Tracking Power Amplifier Design With Envelope Shaping for Broadband Wireless Applications","sourcePdf":"jssc-wu-2265501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11535S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6583962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6583962","articleId":"6542009","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542012,"authors":[{"name":"John Paul Strachan","affiliation":["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6542005/6542012/6542012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["John Paul Strachan (M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in applied physics from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 2007.","He is a Researcher with HP Labs, Palo Alto, CA, USA, and his interests include probing ionic, electronic, and magnetic properties for device applications."]},"firstName":"John Paul","lastName":"Strachan","id":"37544914500"},{"name":"Antonio C.

We have presented novel block-based structures for separable and non-separable filters with less memory footprint by memory sharing and memory-reuse along with appropriate scheduling of computations and design of storage architecture. The proposed structures involve L times less storage per output (SPO), and nearly L times less energy consumption per output (EPO) compared with the existing structures, where L is the input block-size. They involve L times more arithmetic resources than the best of the corresponding existing structures, and produce L times more throughput with less memory band-width (MBW) than others. We have also proposed separate generic structures for separable and non-separable filter-banks, and a unified structure of filter-bank constituting symmetric and general filters. The proposed unified structure for 6 parallel filters involves nearly 3.6L times more multipliers, 3L times more adders, (N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-N+2) less registers than similar existing unified structure, and computes 6L times more filter outputs per cycle with 6L times less MBW than the existing design, where N is FIR filter size in each dimension.

Pansharpening is the process of synthesizing a high spatial resolution multispectral image from a low spatial resolution multispectral image and a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image. The method uses total variation to regularize an ill-posed problem dictated by a widely used explicit image formation model. This model is based on the assumptions that a linear combination of the bands of the pansharpened image gives the PAN image and that a decimation of the pansharpened image gives the original multispectral image. Experimental results are based on two real datasets and the quantitative quality of the pansharpened images is evaluated using a number of spatial and spectral metrics, some of which have been recently proposed and do not need a reference image. The proposed method compares favorably to other well-known methods for pansharpening and produces images of excellent spatial and spectral quality.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2013.2257669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6658878/06542015.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2013.2257669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6658878","startPage":"318","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Pansharpening Algorithm Based on Total Variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Pansharpening Algorithm Based on Total Variation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542015/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13887951","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542015/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Pansharpening Algorithm Based on Total Variation","sourcePdf":"lgrs-sveinsson-2257669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076392S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6658878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6658878","articleId":"6542015","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6542018,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electron Devices and Circuits and the Competence Center on Integrated Circuits in Communications, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6583962/6542018/6542018-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gang Liu (M'12) received the M.Sc. and Dr-Ing. degree from Ulm University, Ulm, Germany, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.","He has been with the Institute of Electron Devices and Circuits, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany, since 2007, where he is currently a Senior Research Assistant.

First, we divide the jamming scene template into sub-templates according to the depth of focus in the range dimension. Next, each sub-template is decomposed into the slow-time-dependent and slow-time-independent terms in the range frequency-azimuth time domain. The slow-time-independent terms are generated off-line while the slow-time-dependent terms are generated by real-time 1-D frequency modulation. Then, the sub-templates are convolved with the intercepted SAR signals simultaneously. Finally, fast deceptive jamming is achieved by incorporating all the sub-templates together. In the proposed method, the two-step realization of the sub-templates and the parallel sub-block processing improves the algorithm efficiency. The simulation results prove the validity of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2259178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2259178","startPage":"4486","endPage":"4495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6565380/06542029.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Large Scene Deceptive Jamming Method for Space-Borne SAR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Large Scene Deceptive Jamming Method for Space-Borne SAR","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","volume":"51","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542029/","accessionNumber":"13686323","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542029/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Large Scene Deceptive Jamming Method for Space-Borne SAR","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhou-2259178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12163S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6565380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6565380","articleId":"6542029","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542030,"authors":[{"name":"Sorin P.

The fundamental frequency Colpitts VCO covers a 12% tuning range between 218 and 246 GHz (the highest for SiGe HBTs) with up to -3.6-dBm output power and 0.8% efficiency. The 300-GHz signal source, consisting of a Colpitts-Clapp VCO followed by a buffer amplifier and a doubler, shows -1.7-dBm output power around 290 GHz, -101-dBc/Hz phase noise at 10-MHz offset, 7.5% tuning range, and 0.4% efficiency. Finally, the push-push Colpitts-Clapp VCO exhibits the highest operation frequency, from 309 to 325 GHz, but with reduced efficiency of only 0.07% and 5% tuning range.

A conclusion is drawn that the energy in dc-link capacitor cannot be kept constant in dynamic process when the system operates in rectifier mode, even in ideal case. Meanwhile, the minimum dc-link voltage deviation is analyzed. Accordingly, a predictive dc-link voltage control scheme based on energy balance is proposed, while the grid current is regulated by deadbeat predictive control. A prediction method for output power is also introduced. Furthermore, a small-signal model with the control delay is adopted to analyze the stability and robustness of the control strategy. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate both good dynamic and steady-state performances of the rectifier-inverter system with the proposed control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6714460/06542032.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2013.2269037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2013.2269037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6714460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved DC-Link Voltage Fast Control Scheme for a PWM Rectifier-Inverter System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Capacitors","Power generation","Pulse width modulation","Inverters","Vectors","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power capacitors","predictive control","PWM invertors","PWM rectifiers","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive dc-link voltage control","rectifier mode","dc-link capacitor","pulse width modulation","energy balance","PWM rectifier-inverter system","DC-link voltage fast control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-link voltage control","energy balance model","induction motor","pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier\u2013inverter system","small dc-link capacitor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Improved DC-Link Voltage Fast Control Scheme for a PWM Rectifier-Inverter System","volume":"50","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6542032/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14040704","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved DC-Link Voltage Fast Control Scheme for a PWM Rectifier-Inverter System","sourcePdf":"tia-yin-2269037-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109861S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6714460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6714460","articleId":"6542032","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6542035,"authors":[{"name":"Anh-Huy Phan","affiliation":["Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Wako, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6587530/6542035/6542035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anh-Huy Phan (M'13) received the master's degree from Hochiminh University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan, in 2011.","He worked as Deputy Head of the Research and Development Department, Broadcast Research and Application Center, Vietnam Television, and is currently a Research Scientist at the Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing, and a Visiting Research Scientist with the Toyota Collaboration Center, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN.

Unfortunately, the algorithms become computationally demanding, and they are often not applicable to higher order and relatively large scale tensors. In this paper, by exploiting the uniqueness of CPD and the relation of a tensor in Kruskal form and its unfolded tensor, we propose a fast approach to deal with this problem. Instead of directly factorizing the high order data tensor, the method decomposes an unfolded tensor with lower order, e.g., order-3 tensor. On the basis of the order-3 estimated tensor, a structured Kruskal tensor, of the same dimension as the data tensor, is then generated, and decomposed to find the final solution using fast algorithms for the structured CPD. In addition, strategies to unfold tensors are suggested and practically verified in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2269046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6587530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2269046","endPage":"4860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6587530/06542035.pdf","startPage":"4847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Decomposition of High-Order Tensors Through Tensor Reshaping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542035/","displayDocTitle":"CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Decomposition of High-Order Tensors Through Tensor Reshaping","volume":"61","issue":"19","accessionNumber":"13820977","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542035/","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Decomposition of High-Order Tensors Through Tensor Reshaping","sourcePdf":"tsp-phan-2269046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150719S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6587530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6587530","articleId":"6542035","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542050,"authors":[{"name":"Chuanhou Gao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6823190/6542050/6542050-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuanhou Gao (M\u201909\u2013SM\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in chemical engineering from the Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree in operational research and cybernetics from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, in 2004.","From June 2004 until May 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University.

To further enhance their practical applications, this paper is concerned with the transparency and comprehensibility of blast furnace black-box models. A fuzzy-based support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm is proposed to perform the tasks of determining the controllable bound from the real data, of reducing feature from extensive candidate inputs, and of training the SVM model parameters. Based on these results, a fuzzy-based blast furnace SVM three-class classifier is constructed to serve for the classification problem according to the output lower than its controlled bound, within the controlled bound and higher than the controlled bound. Further, rule extraction is made to achieve the understandability of the constructed SVM classifier. Through two typical real blast furnace cases, the extracted rules can work well in classifying the hot metal silicon content into low, proper, and high range with high transparency, as well as encouraging agreements between the predicted values and the real ones. Moreover, there needs to be very little information on the blast furnace variables when implementing every rule in practice. The extracted rules provide a more explicit and direct indication for the blast furnace operators and, thus, may serve better for decision-making with blast furnace control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542050/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349501","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rule Extraction From Fuzzy-Based Blast Furnace SVM Multiclassifier for Decision-Making","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11271326 and 61290321"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rule Extraction From Fuzzy-Based Blast Furnace SVM Multiclassifier for Decision-Making","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-gao-2269145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146306S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6823190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6823190","articleId":"6542050","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542188,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoung Joon Kim","affiliation":["Ultra Precision System Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, 305-343, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung Joon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280365000"},{"name":"Min Suk Song","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min Suk","lastName":"Song","id":"37403902100"},{"name":"Jae Hak Lee","affiliation":["Ultra Precision System Division, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Hak","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599576700"},{"name":"Jun Yeob Song","affiliation":["Ultra Precision System Division, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun Yeob","lastName":"Song","id":"37403227900"},{"name":"Kyung-Wook Paik","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-Wook","lastName":"Paik","id":"37283301500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4644-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4645-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4643-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542188","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542188","abstract":"Palladium (Pd) is an important alloying element of Au bonding wire which plays as solid solution-type alloying effect in Au matrix.

Low-frequency stability is obtained by enforcing the Maxwell divergence laws explicitly, by means of a discrete Helmholtz decomposition. Numerical examples demonstrate the stability and low error of the suggested approach.","doi":"10.1109/ESTC.2012.6542195","publicationTitle":"2012 4th Electronic System-Integration Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th Electronic System-Integration Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6478870/6522698/06542195.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTC.2012.6542195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6522698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An E-B mixed finite element method for axially uniform electromagnetic waveguides","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542195/","displayDocTitle":"An E-B mixed finite element method for axially uniform electromagnetic waveguides","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542195/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An E-B mixed finite element method for axially uniform electromagnetic waveguides","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"PAP18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119834S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6478870","isNumber":"6522698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6478870","xplore-issue":"6522698","articleId":"6542195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542256,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Lun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Lun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37065817700"},{"name":"Yu-Kuen Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Kuen","lastName":"Lai","id":"37070414200"},{"name":"Wei-Chih Hu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Chih","lastName":"Hu","id":"37273484600"},{"name":"Wen-Yaw Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Electronics and Information Technology, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Yaw","lastName":"Chung","id":"37280298900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5627-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4960-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542256","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware design languages","Field programmable gate arrays","Adders","Computer architecture","Testing","Education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","digital integrated circuits","educational courses","electronic engineering computing","electronic engineering education","further education","hardware description languages","integrated circuit design","monolithic integrated circuits","semiconductor industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based instruction","digital integrated circuit design course","nonmajor undergraduate","semiconductor industry","digital IC design methodology","hardware description language","physical architecture","HDL code","truth table","5-level agreement questionnaire","case-based engineering course"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Case-based instruction","FPGA","HDL","IC design course","i-learning","Non-major","Undergraduate","Verilog"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542256","abstract":"With the rapid growth of semiconductor industry, there are more and more non-major students hope to learn digital integration circuit (IC) design methodology to improve the performance of their systems. However, the digital IC design methodology becomes more and more abstract to be studied because it tends to hardware description language (HDL) base. It is difficult for undergraduates to study. In this paper, an initial study of using case-based instruction in digital IC design course is described. The proposed case-base course consists of example cases, ten labs, and two projects. Each case includes illustrations of physical architecture, HDL codes, truth tables, waveform, and comments. Students can understand the meaning of HDL by referring to physical architecture, truth table, and waveform with HDL codes. It helps students to understand HDL more realistically rather than abstractively especially for non-major undergraduates. To investigate the effect of case-based instruction for non-major undergraduates, a specific class was constructed by 56 % major and 44 % non-major undergraduates. In the end of the course, both major and non-major undergraduates verified all practical labs and projects successfully. The average scores of agreement are 4.56 by major students and 4.44 by non-major students with a 5-level agreement questionnaire. The results of questionnaire show that most of students liked case-based instruction and looked forward to study other case-based engineering courses in the future.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542221","publicationTitle":"2013 Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542218/6542221/06542256.pdf","doi":"10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.21","startPage":"172","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Case-Based Instruction of Digital Integrated Circuit Design Courses for Non-major Undergraduates","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542256/","displayDocTitle":"Case-Based Instruction of Digital Integrated Circuit Design Courses for Non-major Undergraduates","htmlLink":"/document/6542256/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 March 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13596896","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Case-Based Instruction of Digital Integrated Circuit Design Courses for Non-major Undergraduates","confLoc":"Macau, Macao","sourcePdf":"4960a172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084891S","chronDate":"21-24 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542218","isNumber":"6542221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542218","xplore-issue":"6542221","articleId":"6542256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542425,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Cappelletti","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Cappelletti","id":"37070313700"},{"name":"Nishanth Sastry","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Nishanth","lastName":"Sastry","id":"37317838600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0234-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-5015-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542425","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"abstract":"This work introduces IARank, a novel, simple and accurate model to continuously rank influential Twitter users in real-time. Our model is based on the information amplification potential of a user, the capacity of the user to increase the audience of a tweet or another username that they find interesting, by retweets or mentions. We incorporate information amplification using two factors, the first of which indicates the tendency of a user to be retweeted or mentioned, and the second of which is proportional to the size of the audience of the retweets or mentions. We distinguish between cumulative influence acquired by a user over time, and an important tweet made by an otherwise not-important user, which deserves attention instantaneously, and devise our ranking scheme based on both notions of influence. We show that our methods produce rankings similar to PageRank, which is the basis for several other successful rankings of Twitter users. However, as opposed to PageRank-like algorithms, which take non-trivial time to converge, our method produces rankings in near-real time. We validate our results with a user-study, which shows that our method ranks top users similar to a manual ranking produced by the users themselves. Further, our ranking marginally outperformed PageRank, with 80% of the Top 5 most important users being classified as relevant to the event, whereas, PageRank had 60% of the Top 5 users marked as relevant. However, PageRank produces slightly better rankings, which correlates better with the user-produced rankings, when considering users beyond the top 5.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social networking (online)","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IARank model","user ranking","Twitter","user information amplification potential","user cumulative influence","influence notion","PageRank","user-produced ranking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Twitter","information amplification","real time rank","influence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SocialInformatics.2012.82","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Social Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Social Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542300/6542407/06542425.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SocialInformatics.2012.82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IARank: Ranking Users on Twitter in Near Real-Time, Based on Their Information Amplification Potential","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IARank: Ranking Users on Twitter in Near Real-Time, Based on Their Information Amplification Potential","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542425/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542425/","accessionNumber":"13583467","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IARank: Ranking Users on Twitter in Near Real-Time, Based on Their Information Amplification Potential","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"5015a070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043095S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6542300","isNumber":"6542407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542300","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6542407","articleId":"6542425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542519,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Wei Lin","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Chung-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37062110200"},{"name":"Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli","id":"38271978500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0219-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-5014-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542519","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3329},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyber-Security for the Controller Area Network (CAN) Communication Protocol","abstract":"We propose a security mechanism to help prevent cyber-attacks (masquerade and replay) in vehicles with architecture based on Controller Area Network (CAN).

In this paper, we focus on a security mechanism which keeps the bus utilization as low as possible.

First, an analysis framework is proposed to relate complex attack attributes to detection and business aspects. Second, the framework is used to define a development roadmap for designing advanced intrusion detection systems, such systems can analyze network traffic and client data at multiple network locations using both signature and anomaly detection methods derived from the intelligent data analysis field. Third, a test case is provided showing the potential power of the proposed development roadmap.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Cyber Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542298/6542512/06542526.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Cyber Security","doi":"10.1109/CyberSecurity.2012.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberSecurity.2012.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542512","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systems for Detecting Advanced Persistent Threats: A Development Roadmap Using Intelligent Data Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","computer network security","digital signatures","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["persistent threat detection","cyber-attack attributes","account analysis method","link analysis method","business aspects","intrusion detection system design","network traffic analysis","network locations","client data","signature detection method","anomaly detection method","intelligent data analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intrusion detection","advanced persistent threats","development roadmap","intelligent data analysis","cyber security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Systems for Detecting Advanced Persistent Threats: A Development Roadmap Using Intelligent Data Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542526/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13583698","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systems for Detecting Advanced Persistent Threats: A Development Roadmap Using Intelligent Data Analysis","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"5014a054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075993S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6542298","isNumber":"6542512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542298","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6542512","articleId":"6542526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542536,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Abadie","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Systems, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Abadie","id":"38529317800"},{"name":"Duminda Wijesekera","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Systems, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Duminda","lastName":"Wijesekera","id":"37269730600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0219-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-5014-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542536","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","software radio","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio attack surface","software defined radios","cognitive radio potential","spectrum access challenges","security considerations","SDR infrastructure","holistic approach","vulnerabilities","denial of service","attack graphs","evidence graphs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["software defined radio","cognitive radio","risk engine","attack graphs"]}],"abstract":"The cognitive radio is an emerging technology that holds great promise due to its adaptive nature and ability to exploit the advantages inherent to software defined radios (SDR). The cognitive radio's potential to address spectrum access challenges resulting from an exponential increase in the number of network devices will make it a leading technology of the next decade. For this reason, it is imperative to investigate the security considerations of the cognitive radio in its infancy rather than attempt to address them at maturity. Though research in the vulnerabilities of cognitive radio exists, few explore the threat vectors against both the cognitive engine and the underlying SDR infrastructure within which it operates. This paper takes such a holistic approach, and then further contributes to the research area by offering three misuse cases that portray how the vulnerabilities discussed could be exploited. These cases visualize the risk environment based on a denial of service, an advanced persistent threat, and an insider threat and will allow for security practitioners to anticipate how their organizations may be impacted. Moreover, by introducing a simulation of the threat one can use existing principles to analyze its prosecution (i.e. attack graphs, evidence graphs, etc.).","doi":"10.1109/CyberSecurity.2012.24","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Cyber Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542298/6542512/06542536.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberSecurity.2012.24","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Cyber Security","startPage":"136","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging an Inventory of the Cognitive Radio Attack Surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging an Inventory of the Cognitive Radio Attack Surface","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542536/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542536/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13597010","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging an Inventory of the Cognitive Radio Attack Surface","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"5014a136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06509S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6542298","isNumber":"6542512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542298","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6542512","articleId":"6542536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542602,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Sojer","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems, Fortiss GmbH, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Sojer","id":"37597140400"},{"name":"Frank Reichenbach","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Center, Billingstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Reichenbach","id":"37298882300"},{"name":"Stein-Erik Ellevseth","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Center, Billingstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Stein-Erik","lastName":"Ellevseth","id":"37070205400"},{"name":"Christian Buckl","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems, Fortiss GmbH, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Buckl","id":"37296897900"},{"name":"Alois Knoll","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching bei Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Knoll","id":"37276234100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5746-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4962-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542602","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Runtime","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Safety","Computational modeling","Embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","program compilers","safety-critical software","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven approach","runtime reliability analysis","execution time","state space explosion","code generation","safety-critical embedded systems","low-end computers","changing environmental conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["safety","reliabilty","embedded systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542602","doi":"10.1109/LADC.2013.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LADC.2013.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542587","publicationTitle":"2013 Sixth Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Sixth Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542299/6542587/06542602.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Driven Approach for Runtime Reliability Analysis","abstract":"Runtime reliability analysis has proven to be a valuable technique to enhance the overall reliability of safety-critical systems. It has the potential to close the dependability gap that has been identified by Laprie. However, existing approaches suffer from either too complex and therefore error-prone input languages or from long execution time due to the state space explosion of the underlying analysis techniques. In this paper, we present an approach for runtime reliability analysis, which handles both problems. It provides a compact metamodel that can be used to describe all necessary information. Moreover, it provides analysis algorithms that can be automatically parameterized by code generation. These algorithms are runtime efficient so that they can be executed even on low-end computers, e.g., safety-critical embedded systems, to adapt the system to changing environmental conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542602/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13583443","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Approach for Runtime Reliability Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Approach for Runtime Reliability Analysis","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4962a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049644S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542299","isNumber":"6542587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542299","xplore-issue":"6542587","articleId":"6542602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6542629,"authors":[{"name":"Liyue Fan","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6871455/6542629/fan-96-small.gif","p":["Liyue Fan is a Ph.D. candidate with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.

However, releasing time-series data with standard differential privacy mechanism has limited utility due to high correlation between data values. We propose FAST, a novel framework to release real-time aggregate statistics under differential privacy based on filtering and adaptive sampling. To minimize the overall privacy cost, FAST adaptively samples long time-series according to the detected data dynamics. To improve the accuracy of data release per time stamp, FAST predicts data values at non-sampling points and corrects noisy observations at sampling points. Our experiments with real-world as well as synthetic data sets confirm that FAST improves the accuracy of released aggregates even under small privacy cost and can be used to enable a wide range of monitoring applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6871455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2013.96","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6871455/06542629.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2106","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2013.96","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Approach to Real-Time Aggregate Monitoring With Differential Privacy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Approach to Real-Time Aggregate Monitoring With Differential Privacy","volume":"26","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6542629/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14525936","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Approach to Real-Time Aggregate Monitoring With Differential Privacy","sourcePdf":"tkde-fan-96-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096216S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6871455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6871455","articleId":"6542629","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542643,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Kim","affiliation":["Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Dennis Kim received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), CA, USA, in 2005.

Closed-form expressions for the noise-equivalent angular rate spectrum as well as the integrated angular rate (angle) variance are derived to explore the effects of modal frequency mismatch, closed-loop bandwidth, and the spectra of noise sources appearing at the sensor's input and output. It is shown that noise sources located at the output of the sensor's electromechanical transfer function create angle white noise in the closed-loop sensor. The angle white noise dominates the integrated rate behavior until it crosses the angle random walk asymptote at integration times exceeding the sensor's open-loop time constant. Even though the closed-loop sensor asymptotically recovers the angle random walk figure associated with the mode-matched open-loop sensor, the results can be used to quantify the larger integrated rate variance that is produced as a consequence of extending the sensor's bandwidth through feedback. A parameter, called the effective bandwidth, is introduced to capture the relative importance of the input noise versus output noise in determining the noise-equivalent rate spectrum. It is shown that the rate noise spectrum is robust to frequency mismatch as long as it does not exceed the effective bandwidth parameter. Empirical data obtained with a high performance MEMS vibratory gyro shows excellent agreement with the model predictions for a variety of sensor configurations including frequency-matched, frequency-mismatched, modified bandwidth, and manipulated input noise intensity cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Analysis of Vibratory Gyro Noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2269797","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6609078/06542643.pdf","startPage":"4361","endPage":"4374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2269797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Analysis of Vibratory Gyro Noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6542643/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796326","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Analysis of Vibratory Gyro Noise","sourcePdf":"jsen-mcloskey-2269797-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068333S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6609078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6609078","articleId":"6542643","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542644,"authors":[{"name":"Rongtao Su","affiliation":["College of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Rongtao","lastName":"Su","id":"38243287500"},{"name":"Pu Zhou","affiliation":["College of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37306233800"},{"name":"Xiaolin Wang","affiliation":["College of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311501400"},{"name":"Pengfei Ma","affiliation":["College of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Ma","id":"38243565100"},{"name":"Xiaojun Xu","affiliation":["College of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37308492400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6542644","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542644","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Power lasers","Optimized production technology","Measurement by laser beam","Power generation","Cost function","Laser feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed optical techniques","laser beams","laser mode locking","light coherence","optical fibre amplifiers","optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actively coherent beam combining","single-frequency nanosecond fiber amplifiers","low-repetition-rate","stochastic parallel gradient descent algorithm","pulse width","signal leakage","phase locking","pulsed-pumped laser","wavelength 1083 nm","frequency 5 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent beam combining (CBC)","fiber-optics amplifiers and oscillators","single-frequency lasers","optical pulses"]}],"abstract":"We report on an experiment of active coherent beam combining (CBC) of two single-frequency nanosecond fiber amplifiers with repetition rate of several kilohertz using stochastic parallel gradient descent algorithm.

This concept consists of realizing only the blades of a conventional wind turbine (CWT) in the form of a power kite flying at high speed perpendicular to the wind. On the kite are mounted a turbine, an electrical generator, and a power electronics converter. The electric power generated is transmitted via a medium voltage cable to the ground. Because of the high flight speed of the power kite, several times the actual wind speed, only a very small swept area of the turbine is required according to Betz's Law and/or a turbine of low weight for the generation of a given electric power. Moreover, because of the high turbine rotational speed, no gear transmission is necessary and the size of the generator is also reduced. For takeoff and landing of the power kite, the turbines act as propellers and the generators as motors, i.e., electric power is supplied so that the system can be maneuvered like a helicopter. In the present work, the configuration of power electronics converters for the implementation of a 100 kW AWT is considered. The major aspect here is the trade-off between power-to-weight ratio (W/kg) and efficiency. The dependence of cable weight and cable losses on the voltage level of power transmission is investigated, and a comparison is made between low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) versions of generators. Furthermore, the interdependence of the weight and efficiency of a bidirectional dual active bridge dc-dc converter for coupling the rectified output voltage of a LV generator to the MV cable is discussed. On the basis of this discussion, the concept offering the best possible compromise of weight and efficiency in the power electronics system is selected and a model of the control behavior is derived for both the power flow directions. A control structure is then proposed and dimensioned. Furthermore, questions of electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety are treated. In conclusion, the essential results of this paper are summarized, and an outlook on future research is given. To enable the reader to make simplified calculations and a comparison of a CWT with an AWT, the aerodynamic fundamentals of both the systems are summarized in highly simplified form in an Appendix, and numerical values are given for the 100 kW system discussed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13679028","htmlLink":"/document/6542652/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Conceptualization and Multiobjective Optimization of the Electric System of an Airborne Wind Turbine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conceptualization and Multiobjective Optimization of the Electric System of an Airborne Wind Turbine","sourcePdf":"jestpe-friedli-2269672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157723S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6572818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6572818","articleId":"6542652","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542653,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Iosifidis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Iosifidis","id":"37601485000"},{"name":"Anastasios Tefas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Tefas","id":"37299690600"},{"name":"Ioannis Pitas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Pitas","id":"37276557400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"6542653","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1310},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542653","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel method aiming at view-independent human action recognition.

The tag is composed of a receiver UWB antenna connected to a broadband amplifier. Its output is connected to a cross-polarized transmit antenna. In order to increase the battery lifetime, an UHF link is used to wake up the microcontroller. It modulates the radar cross section of the tag by turning the amplifier bias on and off. The amplitude of the reflected UWB pulse sent by the UWB reader is modulated as a result. The basic theory of operation of ultra-wideband radio identification systems is explained in this paper. A proof of concept using commercial components and experimental results obtained with an ultra-wideband radar are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active UWB Reflector for RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2269473","endPage":"4774","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6588318/06542657.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"4767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2269473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6588318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Ultra wideband antennas","Radiofrequency identification","Detectors","Radar cross-sections","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcontrollers","radar antennas","radiofrequency identification","transmitting antennas","ultra wideband antennas","ultra wideband communication","ultra wideband radar","wideband amplifiers","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active UWB reflector","RFID","wireless sensor networks","active ultrawideband reflector","radiofrequency identification","receiver UWB antenna","broadband amplifier","cross-polarized transmit antenna","battery lifetime","UHF link","microcontroller","radar cross section","UWB pulse","UWB reader","ultrawideband radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active antennas","radio frequency identification (RFID)","transponder","ultra-wideband (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active UWB Reflector for RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6542657/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2013","accessionNumber":"13747987","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active UWB Reflector for RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tap-lazaro-2269473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073796S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6588318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6588318","articleId":"6542657","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6542671,"authors":[{"name":"Yana Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao City, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6823190/6542671/6542671-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yana Yang received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2011, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D degree in electrical engineering.","Her research interests include nonlinear control systems and teleoperation systems design."]},"firstName":"Yana","lastName":"Yang","id":"38513385700"},{"name":"Changchun Hua","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao City, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6823190/6542671/6542671-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Changchun Hua (M\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdaoi, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2005.","He was a Research Fellow with the National University of Singapore, Singapore, from 2006 to 2007.

Then, the adaptive fuzzy-logic system is employed to approximate the system uncertainties, and the corresponding adaptive fuzzy NFTSM controller is designed. By constructing Lyapunov function, the stability and finite-time synchronization performance are proved with the new controller in the presence of system uncertainties and external disturbances. Compared with the traditional teleoperation design method, the new control scheme achieves better transient-state performance and steady-state performance. Finally, the simulations are performed and the comparisons are shown among the proposed method, the P+d method, the PD+d method, the DFF method, and the classic TSM FTSM.

The IIF methodology is used to detect autoimmune diseases by searching for antibodies in the patient serum but, unfortunately, it is still a subjective method that depends too heavily on the experience and expertise of the physician. This has been the motivation behind the recent initial developments of computer aided diagnosis systems in this field. The contest aimed to bring together researchers interested in the performance evaluation of algorithms for IIF image analysis: 28 different recognition systems able to automatically recognize the staining pattern of cells within IIF images were tested on the same undisclosed dataset. In particular, the dataset takes into account the six staining patterns that occur most frequently in the daily diagnostic practice: centromere, nucleolar, homogeneous, fine speckled, coarse speckled, and cytoplasmic. In the paper, we briefly describe all the submitted methods, analyze the obtained results, and discuss the design choices conditioning the performance of each method.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2268163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6613573/06542690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2268163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6613573","startPage":"1878","endPage":"1889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking HEp-2 Cells Classification Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Benchmarking HEp-2 Cells Classification Methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796224","pubMedId":"23797238","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542690/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benchmarking HEp-2 Cells Classification Methods","sourcePdf":"tmi-percannella-2268163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131277S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6613573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"6613573","articleId":"6542690","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542703,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis D.

It is established that the task of identifying source-informative sensors boils down to estimating the support of the sparse covariance factors. To this end, a novel sparsity-aware matrix decomposition framework is developed that can recover the support of the sparse factors of a matrix. Relying on norm-one regularization a centralized formulation is first derived, when sensors are fully connected. Then, the notion of missing covariance entries is employed to develop a distributed sparsity-aware matrix decomposition scheme. The associated minimization problems are solved using computationally efficient coordinate descent iterations combined with matrix deflation mechanisms. A simple scheme is also developed to set appropriately the sparsity-adjusting coefficients. The distributed framework can provably recover the support of the covariance factors when field sources do not overlap, while each subset of sensors sensing a specific source form a connected communication graph. Different from existing approaches, the novel utilization of covariance sparsity allows distributed informative sensor identification, without requiring data model parameters. Numerical tests corroborate that the novel factorization schemes work well even when the sources overlap.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2269044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578576","startPage":"4610","endPage":"4624","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6578576/06542703.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Informative-Sensor Identification via Sparsity-Aware Matrix Decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542703/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed Informative-Sensor Identification via Sparsity-Aware Matrix Decomposition","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13820954","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"18","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Informative-Sensor Identification via Sparsity-Aware Matrix Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tsp-schizas-2269044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137618S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6578576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6578576","articleId":"6542703","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6542711,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Govoreanu","affiliation":["CMOST-MDD, Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6564406/6542711/6542711-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bogdan Govoreanu (M'05\u2013SM'11) received the Ph.D. degree in applied sciences from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2004.","He is currently a Principal Scientist with Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, Leuven."]},"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Govoreanu","id":"37281621100"},{"name":"Sergiu Clima","affiliation":["CMOST-MDD, Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Sergiu Clima received the Ph.D. degree in computational chemistry from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, in 2007.","He joined the First-Principles Modeling Group, Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Leuven, Belgium, as a First-Principles Simulations Researcher."]},"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Clima","id":"37568184200"},{"name":"Iuliana P.

The assessment utilizes three assessment instruments to characterize legged mobility, which are the timed up-and-go test, the Ten-Meter Walk Test (10 MWT), and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), which collectively assess the subject's ability to stand, walk, turn, and sit. The exertion associated with each assessment instrument was assessed using the Physiological Cost Index. Results indicate that the subject was able to perform the respective assessment instruments 25%, 70%, and 80% faster with the exoskeleton relative to the KAFOs for the timed up-and-go test, the 10 MWT, and the 6 MWT, respectively. Measurements of exertion indicate that the exoskeleton requires 1.6, 5.2, and 3.2 times less exertion than the KAFOs for each respective assessment instrument. The results indicate that the enhancement in speed and reduction in exertion are more significant during walking than during gait transitions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Preliminary Assessment of Legged Mobility Provided by a Lower Limb Exoskeleton for Persons With Paraplegia","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2268320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/6807532/06542712.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2268320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6807532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Preliminary Assessment of Legged Mobility Provided by a Lower Limb Exoskeleton for Persons With Paraplegia","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6542712/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267684","pubMedId":"23797285","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Preliminary Assessment of Legged Mobility Provided by a Lower Limb Exoskeleton for Persons With Paraplegia","sourcePdf":"tnsre-farris-2268320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109491S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6807532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6807532","articleId":"6542712","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6542713,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Narbudowicz","affiliation":["Dublin Institute of Technology, Antenna & High Frequency Research Centre, Dublin 8, Ireland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Narbudowicz","id":"37396534000"},{"name":"Xiulong Bao","affiliation":["Dublin Institute of Technology, Antenna & High Frequency Research Centre, Dublin 8, Ireland"],"firstName":"Xiulong","lastName":"Bao","id":"37306415200"},{"name":"Max J.

Different from macrocellular networks, femtocells, which are run by an operator, can provide three access modes, i.e., open, closed, and hybrid access. As a compromise of both open and closed access mode, hybrid mode is considered the most efficient for both operators and customers. In hybrid access mode, a femtocell normally prioritizes different types of users, and users always prefer to choose the femtocell with the best signal quality for better service and saving power, giving rise to a unique mutual preference. This unique mutual preference relationship between femtocells and users makes the admission control much more challenging, and no current approach considers this mutual preference when hybrid femtocells are accessed by many users. In this paper, we model a mutual selection admission (MSA) problem for hybrid femtocells and users, aiming to find a stable matching, where both the preference of femtocells and that of users are satisfied under a backhaul capacity constraint. We show that the problem of seeking an optimal stable matching with maximum cardinality is NP-hard, and we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for solving the MSA problem by seeking a matching with different levels of stability. With extensive simulations, we show that the MSA algorithm can always find a stable matching and have a great rate gain compared with hybrid access for a wide range of users and femtocells.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2269151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6656889/06542726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2269151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6656889","startPage":"4555","endPage":"4564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Mutual-Preference-Based Admission Control Mechanism for Hybrid Femtocells System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Mutual-Preference-Based Admission Control Mechanism for Hybrid Femtocells System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542726/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13881055","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542726/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Mutual-Preference-Based Admission Control Mechanism for Hybrid Femtocells System","sourcePdf":"tvt-cui-2269151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12676S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6656889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6656889","articleId":"6542726","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542727,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Luo","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6680673/6542727/6542727-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wang Luo received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the Intelligent Visual Information Processing and Communication Laboratory, UESTC, in 2012.","He has been with the State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China, since 2012.

Different from the existing author-topic model in which each author and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over topics and words, in AGTM, each genre, author, and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over authors, topics, and words, respectively. The bias of the distribution of the authors with respect to the topics can be rectified by incorporating the distribution of the genres with respect to the authors. Therefore, the classification accuracy of documents is improved when the information of genre is introduced. By representing the images with several visual words, the AGTM can be used for satellite image annotation.

In the conventional methods, high-level spectral parameters, such as mel-cepstra or line spectral pairs, are adopted as the features for hidden Markov model (HMM)-based parametric speech synthesis. Our proposed method described in this paper improves the conventional method in two ways. First, distributions of low-level, un-transformed spectral envelopes (extracted by the STRAIGHT vocoder) are used as the parameters for synthesis. Second, instead of using single Gaussian distribution, we adopt the graphical models with multiple hidden variables, including restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) and deep belief networks (DBN), to represent the distribution of the low-level spectral envelopes at each HMM state. At the synthesis time, the spectral envelopes are predicted from the RBM-HMMs or the DBN-HMMs of the input sentence following the maximum output probability parameter generation criterion with the constraints of the dynamic features. A Gaussian approximation is applied to the marginal distribution of the visible stochastic variables in the RBM or DBN at each HMM state in order to achieve a closed-form solution to the parameter generation problem. Our experimental results show that both RBM-HMM and DBN-HMM are able to generate spectral envelope parameter sequences better than the conventional Gaussian-HMM with superior generalization capabilities and that DBN-HMM and RBM-HMM perform similarly due possibly to the use of Gaussian approximation. As a result, our proposed method can significantly alleviate the over-smoothing effect and improve the naturalness of the conventional HMM-based speech synthesis system using mel-cepstra.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13686292","htmlLink":"/document/6542729/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Spectral Envelopes Using Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks for Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Spectral Envelopes Using Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks for Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tasl-ling-2269291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081544S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6565391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6565391","articleId":"6542729","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6542737,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278409600"},{"name":"Yu-Ling Hou","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ling","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086632879"},{"name":"Te-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Division, Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Tan-Yuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Te-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37419936500"},{"name":"Kuo-Hsin Chen","affiliation":["Department of General Surgery, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Hsin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086633693"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"6542737","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1024},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542737","abstract":"Since the mortality rate of breast cancer in women is gradually increasing, a well-designed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system can assist doctors in early diagnosis of the breast cancer. In this paper, a breast nodule CAD system is developed, and this system aims for a high-performance classifier for characterizing breast nodules as either benign or malignant on an ultrasonic image. A fuzzy cerebellar model neural network (FCMNN) CAD system is developed. Since the FCMNN contains the layers with overlapped membership functions, it possesses more generalization ability than a conventional fuzzy neural network. Moreover, a FCMNN can be viewed as a generation of a fuzzy neural network; if each layer of FCMNN is reduced to contain only one different neuron, then the FCMNN can be reduced to a fuzzy neural network. Thus, it is used to develop a CAD system; this is a novel research on a breast nodule ultrasound image CAD system using an FCMNN. The testing of 65 practical ultrasound images demonstrates that the proposed FCMNN CAD system can distinguish benign or malignant breast nodules with relatively high accuracy (more than 90%), and the intensive experimental results where the resulting classifier outperforms other classifiers, such as a support vector machine and a neural network by using the N -folds cross-validation method are shown. The experimental results are even higher than doctor's diagnosis; therefore, the proposed diagnostic system can serve as an assistant system to help doctors correctly diagnose breast nodules.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2269149","startPage":"693","endPage":"699","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/6823190/06542737.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2269149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breast Nodules Computer-Aided Diagnostic System Design Using Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Ultrasonic imaging","Breast cancer","Feature extraction","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","CAD","fuzzy neural nets","medical image processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast nodules computer-aided diagnostic system design","fuzzy cerebellar model neural networks","mortality rate","breast cancer","high-performance classifier","breast nodule ultrasound image CAD system","FCMNN CAD system","N -folds cross-validation method","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breast nodule classification","cerebellar model neural network","fuzzy system","ultrasound image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Breast Nodules Computer-Aided Diagnostic System Design Using Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Neural Networks","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6542737/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14349509","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC 98-2221-E-155-058-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breast Nodules Computer-Aided Diagnostic System Design Using Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lin-2269149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176752S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6823190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6823190","articleId":"6542737","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6542740,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Ma","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Ma","id":"37401705300"},{"name":"Marco Liserre","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Liserre","id":"37272424200"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"6542740","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1246},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage fluctuations","Wind power generation","Loading","Wind turbines","Circuit faults","Reactive power","Wind speed"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","power generation faults","power grids","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operating conditions","loading conditions","three-level neutral-point-clamp","grid faults","grid side","wind turbine","low-voltage ride-through requirements","LVRT requirements","thermal loading","3L-NPC wind power converter","thermal distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-voltage ride through (LVRT)","multilevel converter","thermal loading","wind power generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542740","abstract":"In order to fulfill the growing demands from the grid side, full-scale power converters are becoming popular in the wind turbine system. The low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) requirements may not only cause control problems but also result in overstressed components for the power converter. However, the thermal loading of the wind power converter under various grid faults is still not yet clarified, particularly at megawatt power level. In this paper, the impacts by three types of grid faults to a three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) wind power converter in terms of operating and loading conditions are analytically solved and simulated. It has been found that the operating and loading conditions of the converter under LVRT strongly depend on the types/severity values of grid voltage dips and also the chosen control algorithms. The thermal distribution among the three phases of the converter may be quite uneven, and some devices are much more stressed than the normal operating condition.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2013.2269894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2013.2269894","startPage":"520","endPage":"530","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6714460/06542740.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6714460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operating and Loading Conditions of a Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Wind Power Converter Under Various Grid Faults","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Operating and Loading Conditions of a Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Wind Power Converter Under Various Grid Faults","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2014","volume":"50","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14032738","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542740/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operating and Loading Conditions of a Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Wind Power Converter Under Various Grid Faults","sourcePdf":"tia-ma-2269894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055186S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","isNumber":"6714460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"34","articleId":"6542740","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6542745,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Magno","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6644298/6542745/6542745-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Magno (M'13) received the M.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.","He is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the MicrelLab group, University of Bologna.

The primary design goal is to devise a system capable of persistent operation for the duration of the life cycle of a target structure. It should be deployable during the construction phase and reconfigurable thereafter, suitable for continuous long-term monitoring. In addition to selecting the most energy efficient useful components to ensure the lowest possible power consumption, it is necessary to consider sources of energy other than, or complementary to, batteries. Thus, the platform incorporates multisource energy harvesting, electrochemical fuel cell (FC), energy storage, recharging capability, and intelligent operation through real-time energy information exchange with the primary controller. It is shown that, with appropriate integration, the device will have sufficient energy to operate perpetually in a distributed WSHM application. This conclusion is demonstrated through experimental results, simulations, and empirical measurements that demonstrate the high-efficiency energy conversion of the harvesters (up to 86%) and low-power characteristics of the platform (less than 1 mW in sleep mode). It is shown that energy autonomy is comfortably achievable for duty cycles up to 0.75%, meeting the demands of the application, and up to 1.5%, invoking the FC.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2267694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2267694","startPage":"1871","endPage":"1881","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6644298/06542745.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6644298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Wireless Monitoring Through Intelligent Hybrid Energy Supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Extended Wireless Monitoring Through Intelligent Hybrid Energy Supply","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2013","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542745/","accessionNumber":"13852223","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542745/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Wireless Monitoring Through Intelligent Hybrid Energy Supply","sourcePdf":"tie-magno-2267694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199512S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6644298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6644298","articleId":"6542745","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542746,"authors":[{"name":"Ansuman Adhikary","affiliation":["Ming-Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ansuman Adhikary received the B.Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2003 and the M.Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 2009, all in Electrical Engineering.

JSDM achieves significant savings both in the downlink training and in the CSIT uplink feedback, thus making the use of large antenna arrays at the base station potentially suitable also for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems, for which uplink/downlink channel reciprocity cannot be exploited. In the proposed scheme, the multiuser MIMO downlink precoder is obtained by concatenating a prebeamforming matrix, which depends only on the channel second-order statistics, with a classical multiuser precoder, based on the instantaneous knowledge of the resulting reduced dimensional \u201ceffective\u201d channel matrix. We prove a simple condition under which JSDM incurs no loss of optimality with respect to the full CSIT case. For linear uniformly spaced arrays, we show that such condition is approached in the large number of antennas limit. For this case, we use Szego's asymptotic theory of Toeplitz matrices to show that a DFT-based prebeamforming matrix is near-optimal, requiring only coarse information about the users angles of arrival and angular spread. Finally, we extend these ideas to the case of a 2-D base station antenna array, with 3-D beamforming, including multiple beams in the elevation angle direction. We provide guidelines for the prebeamforming optimization and calculate the system spectral efficiency under proportional fairness and max-min fairness criteria, showing extremely attractive performance. Our numerical results are obtained via asymptotic random matrix theory, avoiding lengthy Monte Carlo simulations and providing accurate results for realistic (finite) number of antennas and users.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2269476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2269476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6595627/06542746.pdf","startPage":"6441","endPage":"6463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing\u2014The Large-Scale Array Regime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing\u2014The Large-Scale Array Regime","volume":"59","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542746/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13767502","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542746/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing\u2014The Large-Scale Array Regime","sourcePdf":"tit-caire-2269476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146592S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"823","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6542746","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6542749,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6588613/6542749/6542749-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gan Zheng (S'05\u2013M'09\u2013SM'12) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Tianjin University, China, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, both in electronic and information engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2008.","He then worked as a Research Associate at University College London (UCL), London, UK.

This is an unfavorable scenario for secrecy performance as the system is interference-limited. In the literature, assuming that the receiver operates in half duplex (HD) mode, the aforementioned problem has been addressed via use of cooperating nodes who act as jammers to confound the eavesdropper. This paper investigates an alternative solution, which assumes the availability of a full duplex (FD) receiver. In particular, while receiving data, the receiver transmits jamming noise to degrade the eavesdropper channel. The proposed self-protection scheme eliminates the need for external helpers and provides system robustness. For the case in which global channel state information is available, we aim to design the optimal jamming covariance matrix that maximizes the secrecy rate and mitigates loop interference associated with the FD operation. We consider both fixed and optimal linear receiver design at the destination, and show that the optimal jamming covariance matrix is rank-1, and can be found via an efficient 1-D search. For the case in which only statistical information on the eavesdropper channel is available, the optimal power allocation is studied in terms of ergodic and outage secrecy rates. Simulation results verify the analysis and demonstrate substantial performance gain over conventional HD operation at the destination.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2269049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2269049","startPage":"4962","endPage":"4974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6588613/06542749.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6588613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Physical Layer Secrecy Using Full-Duplex Jamming Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Improving Physical Layer Secrecy Using Full-Duplex Jamming Receivers","volume":"61","issue":"20","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13748093","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542749/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Physical Layer Secrecy Using Full-Duplex Jamming Receivers","sourcePdf":"tsp-zheng-2269049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102919S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6588613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"6588613","articleId":"6542749","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6542754,"authors":[{"name":"Qihui Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6656889/6542754/6542754-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qihui Wu (SM'12) received the B.S. degree in communications engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communications and information system from the PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1994, 1997, and 2000, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the PLA University of Science and Technology.

Most existing algorithms, which were originally designed for static channels, are costly and inefficient in the presence of time-varying channels. First, we formulate this problem as a noncooperative game, in which the utility of each player is defined as a function of its experienced expected weighted interference. This game is proven to be an exact potential game with the considered network utility (the expected weighted aggregate interference) serving as the potential function. However, most game-theoretic algorithms are not suitable for the considered network, since they are coupled, i.e., the updating procedure is relying on the actions or payoffs of other players. Then, we propose a simple, completely distributed, and uncoupled stochastic learning algorithm, with which the users learn the desirable channel selections from their individual trial-payoff history. It is analytically shown that the proposed algorithm converges to pure strategy Nash equilibrium in time-varying radio environment; moreover, it achieves optimal channel selection profiles and makes the network interference-free for underloaded or equally loaded scenarios, while achieving, on average, near-optimal performance for overloaded scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Channel Selection in Time-Varying Radio Environment: Interference Mitigation Game With Uncoupled Stochastic Learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2269152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6656889/06542754.pdf","startPage":"4524","endPage":"4538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2269152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6656889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Channel Selection in Time-Varying Radio Environment: Interference Mitigation Game With Uncoupled Stochastic Learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6542754/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13881085","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Channel Selection in Time-Varying Radio Environment: Interference Mitigation Game With Uncoupled Stochastic Learning","sourcePdf":"tvt-xu-2269152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139166S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6656889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6656889","articleId":"6542754","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542758,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel C.

As femtocells are customer-deployed without proper network planning, their interference environment tends to be much more complicated than traditional cellular networks. In this paper, we design a decentralized asynchronous inter-cell coordination method to deal with inter-macrocell interference and inter-femtocell interference. Based on this method, we propose a hierarchical scheme to solve the cross-tier interference problems in macro/femtocell heterogeneous networks. The simulation results show that this scheme can stably allocate subcarriers among cells in a distributed manner, and that it is adaptive to traffic loads and on-offs of femtocell base stations. The target of interference coordination is achieved, and a good spatial multiplexing efficiency can be attained.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542769","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542769.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decentralized interference coordination method for OFDMA femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542769/","displayDocTitle":"A decentralized interference coordination method for OFDMA femtocell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13583561","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542769/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decentralized interference coordination method for OFDMA femtocell networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"ADecentralizedInterferenceCoordinationMethodf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098122S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542770,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Bennis","affiliation":["Entre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542770/6542770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Bennis received his M.

In particular, an application to the case in which small cell networks aim to mitigate the interference caused to the macrocell network, while maximizing their own spectral efficiencies, is presented. The proposed mechanism is based on new notions of reinforcement learning (RL) through which small cells jointly estimate their time-average performance and optimize their probability distributions with which they judiciously choose their transmit configurations. Here, a minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is guaranteed at the macrocell user equipment (UE), while the small cells maximize their individual performances. The proposed RL procedure is fully distributed as every small cell base station requires only an observation of its instantaneous performance which can be obtained from its UE. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed mechanism always converges to an epsilon Nash equilibrium when all small cells share the same interest. In addition, this mechanism is shown to possess better convergence properties and incur less overhead than existing techniques such as best response dynamics, fictitious play or classical RL. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the theoretical findings, highlighting the inherent tradeoffs facing small cells, namely exploration/exploitation, myopic/foresighted behavior and complete/incomplete information.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.060513.120959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06542770.pdf","startPage":"3202","endPage":"3212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.060513.120959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Organization in Small Cell Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Self-Organization in Small Cell Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542770/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13674026","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542770/","volume":"12","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Organization in Small Cell Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"3202-tw1307-bennis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091086S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542770","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6542771,"authors":[{"name":"Elsayed Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542771/6542771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Elsayed Ahmed received his B.

The key challenge in practical full-duplex systems is uncancelled self-interference signal, which is caused by a combination of hardware and implementation imperfections. Thus, we first present a signal model which captures the effect of significant impairments such as oscillator phase noise, low-noise amplifier noise figure, mixer noise, and analog-to-digital converter quantization noise. Using the detailed signal model, we study the rate gain region, which is defined as the region of received signal-of-interest strength where full-duplex systems outperform half-duplex systems in terms of achievable rate. The rate gain region is derived as a piecewise linear approximation in log-domain, and numerical results show that the approximation closely matches the exact region. Our analysis shows that when phase noise dominates mixer and quantization noise, full-duplex systems can use either active analog cancellation or baseband digital cancellation to achieve near-identical rate gain regions. Finally, as a design example, we numerically investigate the full-duplex system performance and rate gain region in typical indoor environments for practical wireless applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","volume":"12","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13674027","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542771/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rate Gain Region and Design Tradeoffs for Full-Duplex Wireless Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Gain Region and Design Tradeoffs for Full-Duplex Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"3556-tw1307-elsay.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064603S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542771","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6542772,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542772/6542772-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tong Xue (S'12) received the B.

Sparsity of the sensor data in three domains due to time correlation, space correlation and multiple access are being utilized. We first provide an in-depth analysis on the CS-based medium access control schemes from a physical layer perspective and reveal the impact of communication signal-to-noise ratio on the reconstruction performance. We show the process of the sensor data converted to the modulated symbols for physical layer transmission and how the modulated symbols being recovered via compressed sensing. This paper further identifies the decision problem of distinguishing between active and inactive transmitters after symbol recovery and shows a comprehensive performance comparison between carrier sense multiple access and the proposed CS-based scheme. Second, a network data recovery scheme that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of communication throughput and show that enhanced performance can be obtained by utilizing the sensed signal's temporal and spatial correlations.","doi":"10.1109/TW.2013.060413.121184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06542772.pdf","startPage":"3399","endPage":"3411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TW.2013.060413.121184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Access and Data Reconstruction in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542772/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Access and Data Reconstruction in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Compressed Sensing","volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674028","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542772/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Access and Data Reconstruction in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"3399-tw1307-xue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086716S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542772","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542773,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Hsien Wang","affiliation":["MediaTek, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542773/6542773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shu-Hsien Wang received her B.S. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2006, and Ph.D. degree in the Institute of Communications Engineering at National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2013.

The proposed CSCA policy consists of two key elements: (i) a decentralized channel selection policy that allows each SU to utilize knowledge of both the spectrum occupancy information and its local channel state information to make local channel access decisions and (ii) a channel reservation policy that allows each SU to compete for use of its selected channel by emitting short reservation packets at the beginning of each frame. In the reservation period, a channel-aware splitting algorithm is utilized to resolve collision among SUs that are competing for the same channel. The splitting procedure is optimized with respect to SUs' channel selection policy and ensures that the SU with the best channel quality prevails when collision is resolved. The CSCA policy is derived with the goal of maximizing the SU's throughput subject to a constraint on the probability of collision with primary users (PUs). To satisfy the collision probability constraint, a minimum channel gain threshold is set on each channel to limit the probability that the channel is accessed by SUs. An iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters in the channel selection and reservation policies, and a low-complexity policy is devised for use in systems with large numbers of channels. The proposed CSCA policies allow SUs to exploit optimally the tradeoff between spectrum availability and channel quality.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.060313.121676","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06542773.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.060313.121676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3458","endPage":"3472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Exploitation of Spectrum and Channel State Information for Channel Reservation and Selection in Interweave Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Exploitation of Spectrum and Channel State Information for Channel Reservation and Selection in Interweave Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542773/","volume":"12","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6542773/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674029","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Exploitation of Spectrum and Channel State Information for Channel Reservation and Selection in Interweave Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3458-tw1307-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113866S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542773","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6542774,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542774/6542774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Li received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, New Mexico, USA, in 2009.

Joint transmit and relay precoding design problems are investigated for multicasting multiple data streams based on two design criteria. In the first scheme, we aim at minimizing the maximal mean-squared error (MSE) of the signal waveform estimation among all receivers subjecting to power constraints at the transmitter and the relay node. This problem is highly nonconvex with matrix variables and the exactly optimal solution is very hard to obtain. We develop an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the transmitter, relay, and receiver matrices through solving convex subproblems. By exploiting the optimal structure of the relay precoding matrix, we then propose a low complexity solution which decouples the optimization of the transmitter and relay matrices under the (moderately) high first-hop signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) assumption. In the second scheme, we propose a total transmission power minimization strategy subjecting to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By using the optimal structure of the relay precoding matrix and the (moderately) high first-hop SNR assumption, we show that this problem can be solved using the semidefinite programming (SDP) technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Interestingly, we show that for the special case of single data stream multicasting, the relay precoding matrix optimization problem can be equivalently converted to the transmit beamforming problem for single-hop multicasting systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.060413.121817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06542775.pdf","startPage":"3544","endPage":"3555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.060413.121817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding Design for MIMO Relay Multicasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542775/","displayDocTitle":"Precoding Design for MIMO Relay Multicasting","volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674030","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542775/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding Design for MIMO Relay Multicasting","sourcePdf":"3544-tw1307-khan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07779S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542775","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6542776,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoge Huang","affiliation":["Group of Information and Communication Systems (GSIC), Institute of Robotics and Information & CommunicationTechnologies (IRTIC), University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542776/6542776-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoge Huang received her B.

The resulting optimization problem for each cognitive user is non-convex, thus leading to a non-convex game, which presents a new challenge when analyzing the equilibria of this game where each cognitive user represents a player. In order to deal with the non-convexity of the game, we use a new relaxed equilibria concept, namely, quasi-Nash equilibrium (QNE). A QNE is a solution of a variational inequality obtained under the first-order optimality conditions of the player's problems, while retaining the convex constraints in the variational inequality problem. In this work, we state the sufficient conditions for the existence of the QNE for the proposed game. Specifically, under the so-called linear independent constraint qualification, we prove that the achieved QNE coincides with the NE. Moreover, a distributed primal-dual interior point optimization algorithm that converges to a QNE of the proposed game is provided in the paper, which is shown from the simulations to yield a considerable performance improvement with respect to an alternating direction optimization algorithm and a deterministic game.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.060413.121158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","startPage":"3326","endPage":"3337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06542776.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-Nash Equilibria for Non-Convex Distributed Power Allocation Games in Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542776/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Nash Equilibria for Non-Convex Distributed Power Allocation Games in Cognitive Radios","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674031","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Nash Equilibria for Non-Convex Distributed Power Allocation Games in Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"3326-tw1307-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098774S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542776","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6542777,"authors":[{"name":"Vijayvaradharaj T.

Assuming that the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying scheme is adopted, this network is shown to be equivalent to a two-user interference channel (IC). By deploying two IC decoding schemes, i.e., single-user decoding and joint decoding, respectively, we characterize the achievable rate regions with a two-stage iterative optimization method: First, we fix the source power pair and maximize the sum rate over the relay combining vector; second, we fix the relay combining vector and optimize the source power pair. Specifically, for single-user decoding, we design a new routine to compute the optimal solution for the first subproblem, which is more efficient than the existing scheme; and for the second subproblem, we develop an iterative algorithm, with the closed-form solution for each iteration. Furthermore, it is revealed that the AF scheme with relay conferencing achieves the full degree-of-freedom (DoF), which outperforms the case without relay conferencing. Finally, simulation results show that relay conferencing can significantly improve the system performance under certain channel conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542781/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674035","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Source Power Allocation and Relaying Design for Two-Hop Interference Networks with Relay Conferencing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source Power Allocation and Relaying Design for Two-Hop Interference Networks with Relay Conferencing","sourcePdf":"3213-tw1307-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107977S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542781","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542782,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The spectrum coordination can be fulfilled either via existing cognitive radio interface with time division or via a separate dedicated radio, i.e., a common control interface (CCI), continuously. CR nodes with CCI can instantly exchange licensed user detection information and cease frame transmission, while spectrum coordination can only be performed after the frame transmission period without CCI. Nevertheless, the impact of CCI incorporation into CR nodes in terms of common performance metrics must be thoroughly assessed to evaluate the worthiness of additional radio cost. In this paper, an analytical framework is presented to assess the impact of CCI incorporation into CR nodes for spectrum handoff. The developed framework enables analyzing potential benefits and disadvantages of employing CCI for spectrum handoff, in terms of achievable delay, energy consumption, spectrum utilization and event estimation performance. Extensive performance evaluations are presented to illustrate the impact of CCI utilization on efficiency of spectrum handoff. The network and communication regimes that would yield having CCI favorable are characterized in terms of spectrum conditions and CR parameters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Delays","Cognitive radio","Estimation","Distortion","Random variables","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","mobility management (mobile radio)","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dedicated radio utilization","spectrum handoff","spectrum efficiency","cognitive radio networks","licensed user detection information exchange","spectrum coordination","common control channel","cognitive radio interface","time division","separate dedicated radio","common control interface","CCI","CR nodes","frame transmission period","radio cost","achievable delay","energy consumption","spectrum utilization","event estimation performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum handoff","common control interface","frame transmission duration","spectrum efficiency","energy efficiency","cognitive radio sensor networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TW.2013.060413.121073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7244275/06542782.pdf","startPage":"5251","endPage":"5259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TW.2013.060413.121073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dedicated Radio Utilization for Spectrum Handoff and Efficiency in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dedicated Radio Utilization for Spectrum Handoff and Efficiency in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542782/","volume":"14","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15451995","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dedicated Radio Utilization for Spectrum Handoff and Efficiency in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"TW-Jul-12-1073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018284S","chronDate":"September  2015","isNumber":"7244275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6542782","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6542783,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Osman","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542783/6542783-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassan Osman (M'10) received his BSc in Telecommunication Engineering and his MSc in ICT from the University of Bologna, Italy in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

It has been demonstrated that distributed antenna systems (DASs) improve the performance of the indoor environment by covering dead spots. In this paper, the achievable rate is investigated for indoor high data rate wireless transmission in high buildings when DASs are employed. In the system, radio transmission/reception within one or several neighbouring floors is controlled by one central unit (CU) exploiting the entire system bandwidth. In order to efficiently use the spectrum, the same frequency channels are reused among floors controlled by different CUs. The radio signals in high buildings can propagate vertically and reach the neighbouring floors. Therefore, the performance of the system is limited by cochannel interference. Direct propagation inside the building and reflection from nearby buildings are considered in the channel model. The achievable rate of the system is evaluated through analysis and simulation. The impact of representative system parameters on the achievable rate, including the number of remote antenna units (RAUs), the frequency reuse factor, the floor penetration loss, the path loss exponent, and the Nakagami fading parameter, is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674036","htmlLink":"/document/6542783/","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Rate Evaluation of In-Building Distributed Antenna Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Rate Evaluation of In-Building Distributed Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"3510-tw1307-osman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084597S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542783","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542784,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar Zafar","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542784/6542784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ammar Zafar S'12) received his B.E. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

To achieve this objective, the first and second hops are scheduled opportunistically based on the channel state information. The joint scheduling problem is formulated as maximizing the weighted sum of the long term achievable rates of the users under a stability constraint, which means that in the long term the rate received by the relay should equal the rate transmitted by it, in addition to power constraints. We show that this problem is equivalent to a single-hop broadcast channel by treating the source as a virtual user with an optimal weight that maintains the stability constraint. We show how to obtain the source weight either off-line based on channel statistics or on real-time based on channel measurements. Furthermore, we consider special cases including the maximum sum-rate scheduler and the proportional fair scheduler. We also show how to extend the scheme into one that allows multiple user scheduling via superposition coding with successive decoding. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed joint scheduling scheme enlarges the rate region as compared to scheduling schemes that exploit the diversity gains partially.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13679327","htmlLink":"/document/6542784/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Multi-User Diversity and Multi-Hop Diversity in Dual-Hop Broadcast Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Multi-User Diversity and Multi-Hop Diversity in Dual-Hop Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"3314-tw1307-zafar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125849S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542784","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542786,"authors":[{"name":"Daegun Oh","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542786/6542786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daegun Oh received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electronics Engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005, 2007, and 2010 respectively.

For the shift invariant TOA estimation, the received signals must be transformed into a sinusoidal form. When the received signals are perturbed by a CFO, the frequency of the transformed sinusoids is also shifted such that the TOA estimation results are biased. The TOA-induced phase shift of the multi-band chirp signals is determined according to the parameters of the signal, while the CFO-induced phase shift is only proportional to the elapsed time. Based on this property, the proposed ELSITE algorithm achieves robust TOA estimation against CFO from the signal subspace of the stacked matrix. The root mean square error of the proposed algorithm was analyzed and verified in both an AWGN channel and a multipath channel with CFO via Monte-Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.060413.112013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06542786.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.060413.112013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","startPage":"3130","endPage":"3139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional ESPRIT-Like Shift-Invariant TOA Estimation Algorithm Using Multi-Band Chirp Signals Robust to Carrier Frequency Offset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional ESPRIT-Like Shift-Invariant TOA Estimation Algorithm Using Multi-Band Chirp Signals Robust to Carrier Frequency Offset","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13679328","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542786/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional ESPRIT-Like Shift-Invariant TOA Estimation Algorithm Using Multi-Band Chirp Signals Robust to Carrier Frequency Offset","sourcePdf":"3130-tw1307-oh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083044S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542786","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542787,"authors":[{"name":"Salil Kashyap","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6542787/6542787-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Salil Kashyap received his Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communication Eng. from NERIST, Itanagar in 2007 and Master of Technology degree in Digital Signal Processing from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati in 2009.

We analyze a comprehensive new model for AS that captures several key features about its operation in wideband orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. These include the use of channel-aware frequency-domain scheduling (FDS) in conjunction with AS, the hardware constraint that a user must transmit using the same antenna over all its assigned subcarriers, and the scheduling constraint that the subcarriers assigned to a user must be contiguous. The model also captures the novel dual pilot training scheme that is used in LTE, in which a coarse system bandwidth-wide sounding reference signal is used to acquire relatively noisy channel state information (CSI) for AS and FDS, and a dense narrow-band demodulation reference signal is used to acquire accurate CSI for data demodulation. We analyze the symbol error probability when AS is done in conjunction with the channel-unaware, but fair, round-robin scheduling and with channel-aware greedy FDS. Our results quantify how effective joint AS-FDS is in dispersive environments, the interactions between the above features, and the ability of the user to lower SRS power with minimal performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.060313.121742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06542787.pdf","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.060313.121742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Antenna Selection and Frequency-Domain Scheduling in OFDMA Systems with Imperfect Estimates from Dual Pilot Training Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542787/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Antenna Selection and Frequency-Domain Scheduling in OFDMA Systems with Imperfect Estimates from Dual Pilot Training Scheme","volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674037","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542787/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Antenna Selection and Frequency-Domain Scheduling in OFDMA Systems with Imperfect Estimates from Dual Pilot Training Scheme","sourcePdf":"3473-tw1307-salil.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089731S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6542787","onlineDate":"18 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542794,"authors":[{"name":"Li Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Gao","id":"37070133900"},{"name":"Haifeng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37712804000"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"},{"name":"Yanhui Lu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanhui","lastName":"Lu","id":"37656766200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542794","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","quality of service","radio spectrum management","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint design","cognitive radio networks","CR system","radio spectrum utilization","spectrum sharing scheme","cooperative game","quality of service","QoS","secondary users","SU","admission control scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sharing","cooperative game","access control"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sharing is one of the most crucial techniques in cognitive radio (CR) system.

novel spectrum-aware routing protocol for multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) technology is a new communication paradigm that can be a solution to the spectrum scarcity problem. The new spectrum usage pattern necessitates corresponding routing protocols to exploit the available spectrum opportunistically. In this paper, we propose a novel Spectrum-Aware Routing Protocol (SARP) for multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks. SARP integrates channel choice with route discovery to cope with dynamic spectrum by considering the actions of PUs. In addition, a local route maintenance and recovery mechanism is presented to deal with sudden appearance of PUs. Rerouting probability and channel usage ratio are introduced to evaluate the performance of this routing protocol. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces rerouting probability obviously and increases channel usage ratio of SUs significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542813/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13583588","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542813/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel spectrum-aware routing protocol for multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel spectrum-aware routing protocol for multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"ANovelSpectrumAwareRoutingProtocolforMultihop.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048672S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542817,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406086600"},{"name":"Xiaodong Ji","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Ji","id":"37590162400"},{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542817","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Long Term Evolution","optimisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rank adaptive beamforming scheme","TDD LTE system","imperfect CSI","Long Term Evolution system","channel state information","user equipments","UE","channel quality indicator","CQI threshold","channel eigenvalue ratio threshold","channel estimation error","rank adaptation","hybrid automatic repeat request","HARQ feedback","current transmission mode","information transmission mode","parameter optimization","beamforming rank adaptation","spectrum efficiency"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rank adaptive beamforming scheme for TDD LTE system with imperfect CSI","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542817.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542817","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542817","abstract":"A rank adaptive beamforming scheme for Long Term Evolution (LTE) system with imperfect channel state information (CSI) is proposed in this paper, where the rank of user equipments (UEs) is adapted based on two configurable thresholds: channel quality indicator (CQI) threshold and channel eigenvalue ratio threshold.

Moreover, the adaptation parameter of eigenvalue ratio threshold can be optimized based on hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback information and current transmission mode.

In this paper, a novel adaptive transmission scheme used in OFDM system is proposed to increase the system capacity by adaptively adjusting the transmission mode depending on channel parameters. In FDD mode, channel estimation is needed to feedback to the transmitter, which brings delay. Channel parameters of current frame are used to determine the modulation scheme of the next frame. When the multiplicity of Doppler frequency and frame length is below 0.022, current channel parameters can be used to determine the modulation mode of the next frame. When the multiplicity of Doppler frequency and frame length is below 0.2, the prediction of the channel parameters of the next frame is used for modulation mode. When the multiplicity of Doppler frequency and frame length is above 0.2, average SINR is used to determine the modulation mode. Simulations results show that this adaptive modulation scheme can achieve good performance with low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542831","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542831.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive transmission scheme for OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive transmission scheme for OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542831/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596681","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542831/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive transmission scheme for OFDM system","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"AdaptiveTransmissionSchemeforOFDMSystem.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072692S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542832,"authors":[{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Liniin Hou","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liniin","lastName":"Hou","id":"37070416200"},{"name":"Luping Ma","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Luping","lastName":"Ma","id":"37070066100"},{"name":"Lei Shen","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37287404100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542832","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood decoder","decoding complexity","transmit antenna","base station","M receive antennas","multiuser multiple input multiple output system","MU-MIMO system","affine projection decoders"]}],"abstract":"For uplink of Multiuser (MU) Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with M receive antennas at base station and one transmit antenna at each user, in this paper, new decoders, namely affine projection decoders, are proposed.

In this paper, we consider OFDMA networks which can fully guarantee the confidential message transmission for each user. We present a malicious and active eavesdropper, which is registered in the OFDMA network and reports a false channel state information (CSI) to the base station (BS) in order to obtain chance of eavesdrop. The detriment to the system security caused by the false CSI attack is evaluated. To combat the attack of the malicious user, a defence scheme at the BS, namely, CSI compensation, is proposed and its efficiency is analyzed. Numerical studies show that the proposed defence scheme can effectively reduce the eavesdrop probability and secrecy loss.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542843","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542843.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of false CSI attack by a malicious user in OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of false CSI attack by a malicious user in OFDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542843/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596693","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6542843/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of false CSI attack by a malicious user in OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"AnalysisofFalseCSIAttackbyaMaliciousUserinOFD.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056786S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542845,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Li","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Li","id":"37836093300"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37070262900"},{"name":"Yongqiang Hei","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Hei","id":"37870280100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542845","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"abstract":"The performance of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems is significantly influenced by Antenna Gain Imbalance (AGI). A novel AGI detection method using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is present in this paper. Based on the establishment of the AGI model, the AGI detection problem is described as an optimization problem considering multi-user channel information. The PSO algorithm is introduced to minimize fitness function expressed by the mean square error of the AGI parameters through adjusting the positions of the particles. Further, the convergence condition is obtained from swarm size and iteration number. The simulation results show that the PSO algorithm is much better than statistic method and can obtain nearly the same performance as the optimal method with low complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing

in two-way orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) relay system. In this paper, we propose a novel asymmetric network coding scheme for two-way OFDM relay system with power allocation to improve the throughput and bit error rate (BER) performance. In the multiple access channel (MAC) phase, the relay receives asymmetric data from two terminals, respectively. The Max-Min power allocation is used to improve the system BER performance during the MAC phase. In the broadcast (BC) phase, a novel asymmetric network coding scheme based on the thought of adaptive modulation (AM) is proposed. The stronger link can reliably transmit more data by using higher-order modulation. The weaker link can adaptively reduce the modulation order with the help of bit-inserting zero approach and well-designed signal constellation and bit labeling, hence, improve the transmission reliability. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme outperforms the symbol-inserting zeros scheme in BER and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542846","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542846.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric network coding for two-way OFDM relay system with power allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542846/","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric network coding for two-way OFDM relay system with power allocation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596696","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542846/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric network coding for two-way OFDM relay system with power allocation","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"AsymmetricNetworkCodingforTwoWayOFDMRelaySyst.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046616S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542852,"authors":[{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn \u00d6ftersten","affiliation":["Universite du Luxembourg, Luxembourg, LU"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"\u00d6ftersten"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542852","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel capacity","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel parameters","variance-profiled Gaussian matrices","free probability theory","asymptotic closed-form expressions","ergodic capacity","dual-hop system","multiple antenna transceivers","spectral efficiency","relay channels","dual-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO multiple-access channels","capacity analysis"]}],"abstract":"Relay channels have been heavily studied during the last decades as a means of improving spectral efficiency, availability and coverage in combination with multiple antenna transceivers. Relay channels can comprise many hops but the most practical approach at the time being would be a dual-hop system. In addition, the simplest method of relaying in terms of complexity is amplify and forward. In this direction, we investigate the ergodic capacity of a dual-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO MAC and we derive asymptotic closed-form expressions based on the principles of free probability theory. We extend the current literature by proposing a analytical model which can accommodate variance-profiled Gaussian matrices.

We compare their bit error rate (BER) performance, receiver complexities as well as peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) in different scenarios. Simulations show that O-OFDM-IDMA is more power efficient than O-OFDMA, especially for higher throughput, at the cost of higher computational complexity. The PAPRs of O-OFDM-IDMA and O-OFDMA do not show much difference. Those results provide a useful guidance for the design of future networks based on VLC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542858.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of optical OFDM-IDMA and optical OFDMA for uplink visible light communications","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher computational complexity cost","higher throughput","multicarrier transmission schemes","VLC channels","uplink visible light communications","optical orthogonal frequency division multiple access","optical OFDMA","optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing interleave division multiple access","optical OFDM-IDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of optical OFDM-IDMA and optical OFDMA for uplink visible light communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542858/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596704","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of optical OFDM-IDMA and optical OFDMA for uplink visible light communications","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"ComparisonofOpticalOFDMIDMAandOpticalOFDMAfor.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058615S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542860,"authors":[{"name":"Yejun He","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yejun","lastName":"He","id":"37398856500"},{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37899492000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542860","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542860","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QC LDPC codes","GPU","shortened cycle elimination algorithm","quasicyclic low density parity check","graphic processing unit","cycle statistics algorithm","base matrices","girth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QC-LDPC","girth","Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)","Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)"]}],"abstract":"Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for increasing girth, a shortened cycle elimination algorithm to construct Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check (QC-LDPC) codes with large girth based on the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) is presented.

For each BS, we partition the antennas into two clusters, with one cluster serving an in-cell user, and the second clusters of all BSs cooperatively serving a cell-edge user in the network. To do so, an interference cancelation scheme is devised to prevent the interference to the in-cell user from the cell-edge user. Then, we derive a suboptimal joint precoding based on the concept of signal-to-leakage plus noise ratio (SLNR) and present a power allocation method over the two clusters of antennas assuming that the second antenna clusters of the BSs have the same transmit power. Finally, the other similar transmission scheme is proposed to improve the performance of the cell-edge user.

In BCS, a Bayesian hierarchy is established utilizing Bayesian inference, thus gives the reconstruction algorithm plenty of robust and flexibility. When dealing with distributed scenario, Bayesian hierarchy is also an effective method. Not only can statistic model be built on the sparse signal itself, but also the inter-correlation between distributed signals can be exploited from statistic viewpoint. Based on BCS, connection between distributed signals is studied and utilized. By adopting spike and slab model, a Bayesian hierarchy including inter-correlation is established to model the distributed compressive sensing (DCS) architecture. With the help of Gibbs sampler, the hierarchy becomes solvable. Simulation results show it has a manifest promotion to reconstruction performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542872.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Bayesian Compressive Sensing using Gibbs sampler","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed Bayesian compressive sensing","Gibbs sampler","s-parse signal","Bayesian hierarchy","Bayesian inference","reconstruction algorithm","statistic model","spike and slab model","distributed compressive sensing architecture","DCS architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed","Compressive Sensing","Gibbs Sampler","Spike and Slab"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Bayesian Compressive Sensing using Gibbs sampler","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542872/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13583608","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Bayesian Compressive Sensing using Gibbs sampler","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"DistributedBayesianCompressiveSensingUsingGib.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073178S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6542877,"authors":[{"name":"Shujing Xie","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shujing","lastName":"Xie","id":"37674355100"},{"name":"Lianfeng Shen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lianfeng","lastName":"Shen","id":"37287404700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542877","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-threshold energy detection","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","noise uncertainty environment","AWGN channel","Rayleigh channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","double-threshold","noise uncertainty","variance","energy detection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-threshold energy detection of spectrum sensing for cognitive radio under noise uncertainty environment","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542877","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542877","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the energy detection for spectrum sensing under noise uncertainty environment.

The strategy is applied in AWGN and Rayleigh channels with obvious improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13583612","htmlLink":"/document/6542877/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Double-threshold energy detection of spectrum sensing for cognitive radio under noise uncertainty environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-threshold energy detection of spectrum sensing for cognitive radio under noise uncertainty environment","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"DoublethresholdEnergyDetectionofSpectrumSensi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052916S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6542879,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843700"},{"name":"Alan Hylton","affiliation":["NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Hylton","id":"37070338400"},{"name":"James Budinger","affiliation":["NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Budinger","id":"37542660700"},{"name":"Jennifer Nappier","affiliation":["NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Nappier","id":"38667364800"},{"name":"Joseph Downey","affiliation":["NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Downey","id":"38072935000"},{"name":"Daniel Raible","affiliation":["NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Raible","id":"38075618100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542879","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","optical communication","optical links","photon counting","pulse position modulation","space communication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-pulse pulse position modulation","DPPM","deep-space optical communications","wave-front distortion","photon counting detector","optical wireless systems","Z-channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dual-pulse pulse position modulation (DPPM)","strong turbulence","negative-exponential fading","bit/symbol error rate","energy efficiency","bandwidth efficiency","channel capacity"]}],"abstract":"Due to its simplicity and robustness against wave-front distortion, pulse position modulation (PPM) with photon counting detector has been seriously considered for long-haul optical wireless systems.

The capacity of the turbulent FSO channel modeled as a Z-channel is evaluated, and throughput, bandwidth efficiency and energy efficiency of Dual-pulse and single-pulse PPM are subsequently assessed. It is shown that, under a set of practical constraints including pulse width and pulse repetition frequency (PRF), dual-pulse PPM enables a better channel utilization and hence a higher throughput than its single-pulse counterpart.

In particular, a slotted sensing-transmission model which incorporates both the energy detection and the feedback transmission based on the S-K scheme is considered. The power consumption and error probability of the S-K coding scheme due to the interference from the primary user are quantitatively analyzed.

The CSI feedback for scheduling is considered as a channel direction quantization with feedback delay effect. Inspired by the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) based user scheduling, we present an improved user selection scheme by using a modified signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based metric under only quantized CSI feedback with a channel quality information (CQI) indicator. Different from the traditional ZF-based beamforming(BF), we find that a simple channel-norm based CQI feedback will be sufficient for our modified SLNR-based scheduling. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling under outdated and quantized CSI feedback.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542890","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542890.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced multiuser scheduling using modified SLNR metric with outdated partial CSI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced multiuser scheduling using modified SLNR metric with outdated partial CSI","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6542890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596718","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542890/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced multiuser scheduling using modified SLNR metric with outdated partial CSI","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"EnhancedMultiuserSchedulingUsingModifiedSLNRM.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.194367S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6542891,"authors":[{"name":"Zelang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zelang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38239775600"},{"name":"Huifang Chen","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Huifang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293466200"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542891","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","fading channels","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic capacity region","uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access network","fading channel","optimal resource allocation","convex optimization theory","weighted ergodic sum rate maximization problem","continuous rate adaption","discrete rate adaption","per-user power constraint","two-user uplink OFDMA network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ergodic capacity region","convex optimization","uplink OFDMA network","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the resource allocation policy and algorithm for the uplink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) network over the fading channel is studied.

For the optical system or ultra-high speed wireless data transfer system, it is hard to gain soft LLRs which need to be supplied by ultra-high speed A/D converters, so the hard decision decoder is important for these systems. Similar with Gallager's bit-flipping algorithm for LDPC, the Weighted Bit Flip Voting (WBFV) algorithm has been proposed to decode GLDPC with only the hard decision which proved to be good performance. But the finding of max vote in the algorithm is intractability for the hardware implementation. If we find the max from thousands of data (code length is usually thousands) serially, thousands of cycles needed result to large latency; a lot of compare modules needed for parallel finding of the max, result to large resource. In this paper, we proposed an improved and simplified WBFV algorithm which without max voting finding is easy for hardware implementation. The proposed improved algorithm not only has no performance loss, but also speeds up the iteration convergence. Then we proposed a full parallel GLDPC decoder design for our algorithm with very low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542910","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542910.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Weighted Bit Flip Voting decoding algorithm for generalized LDPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542910/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Weighted Bit Flip Voting decoding algorithm for generalized LDPC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596738","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542910/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Weighted Bit Flip Voting decoding algorithm for generalized LDPC","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"ImprovedWeightedBitFlipVotingDecodingAlgorith.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040717S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6542911,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405852800"},{"name":"Mu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37070172700"},{"name":"Xujing Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xujing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37599609500"},{"name":"Zulin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zulin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404933700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542911","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","decoding","error statistics","matrix algebra","parity check codes","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waterfall thresholds","positive impacts","BER curves","trapping set elimination","belief propagation decoding algorithms","RC-constrained parity-check matrices","algebraic low-density parity-check codes","algebraic LDPC codes","nontrivial redundant rows","gain 0.2 dB"]}],"abstract":"One of the most interesting features of some algebraic LDPC codes is that their RC-constrained parity-check matrices have several or many redundant rows.

Because of the attractive properties it has, such as controllable PAPR, capability to exploit the signal space diversity, etc., V-OFDM has drawn more and more attention recently. At the receiver end, the conventional coherent receiver usually assumes separated detector and channel estimator, which limits the system performance. The integrated MAP (IMAP) receiver, proposed by Luo and Huang for V-BLAST and OFDM, combines the detector and channel estimator and is shown to have better performance than the separated ones. In this paper, we exploit the principal of I MAP, and develop the receiving algorithm for V-OFDM. By utilizing the special structure of the V-OFDM signal, we propose some methods to simplify the IMAP receiver. In the simulations, we show that the developed IMAP receiver performs much better than the receiver composed of separated conventional MAP (CMAP) detector and MMSE channel estimator, where both of them assume the same knowledge of the channel correlation statistical information and noise variance. Further, it is shown that when the sub-block size of V-OFDM is 4 and using 2 sub-blocks as pilots, the performance gap between the IMAP receiver, which has only statistical channel information, and the CMAP receiver with perfect instantaneous channel state information is less than 0.5dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated MAP detector with statistical channel information for vector OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542913","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542913.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Integrated MAP detector with statistical channel information for vector OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542913/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596741","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated MAP detector with statistical channel information for vector OFDM systems","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"IntegratedMAPDetectorwithStatisticalChannelIn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062476S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542915,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wu","id":"38543044200"},{"name":"Hailun Xia","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hailun","lastName":"Xia","id":"37599360300"},{"name":"Chunyan Feng","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunyan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289215100"},{"name":"Sainan Li","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sainan","lastName":"Li","id":"38542691900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542915","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","game theory","gradient methods","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference mitigation","two tier OFDMA femtocell networks","potential game based distributed power control algorithm","SINR","utility function","macrocell","global optimization problem","local optimization problem","gradient projection response criterion","rational power allocation","resource block"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interference mitigation","OFDMA femtocell","potential game","gradient projection","power control"]}],"abstract":"The problem of interference mitigation in two-tier downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) femtocell networks is considered in this paper.

Based on gradient projection response criterion, dynamically rational power allocation for each resource block is performed, achieving the coordination of interference between macrocell and femtocell and increasing system capacity.

In contrast to the conventional research on two-way relay systems, we combine a multi-hop relay system with a bi-directional relay system which further enhances the system performance. By decoupling the original highly non-convex problem into three sub-problems, we propose an iterative algorithm to alternatively optimize relay precoders and receivers. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed iterative algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of bit-error-rate (BER).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint MMSE precoding design in multi-hop bi-directional MIMO relay systems","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542921","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542921.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint MMSE precoding design in multi-hop bi-directional MIMO relay systems","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542921/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596749","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint MMSE precoding design in multi-hop bi-directional MIMO relay systems","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"JointMMSEPrecodingDesigninMultiHopBiDirection.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068666S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542922,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Deng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Deng","id":"37070030100"},{"name":"Rongqing Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongqing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37711217200"},{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingyang","lastName":"Song","id":"37288632100"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37278605300"},{"name":"Guang Yang","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37070010800"},{"name":"Bingli Jiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingli","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37282213500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542922","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distributed algorithms","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","game theory","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint power control-subchannel allocation","distributed auction game","cross-tier interference mitigation problem","co-tier interference mitigation problem","two-tier OFDMA femtocell network","femtocell base station","femtocell BS","auction-based distributed algorithm","subchannel resource allocation","computational complexity","power consumption"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the co-tier and cross-tier interference mitigation problem using power control in a two-tier OFDMA femtocell network.

The simulation results show that the optimal number of cognitive radios and maximal normalized sensing throughput can be obtained by the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542927","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542927.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542927","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint spectrum sensing and user selection strategy for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint spectrum sensing and user selection strategy for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542927/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542927/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596755","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint spectrum sensing and user selection strategy for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"JointSpectrumSensingandUserSelectionStrategyf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041729S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542928,"authors":[{"name":"Jintao Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Jintao","lastName":"Li","id":"37070334100"},{"name":"YiBin Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"YiBin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37070406800"},{"name":"Hui Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yu","id":"37401022100"},{"name":"Yunfeng Guan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Guan","id":"37290140800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542928","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542928","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","modulation coding","parity check codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC coded modulation system","Rayleigh fading channels","low-density-parity-check coded modulation system","expand-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding and demapping","BEICM-ID scheme","bit nodes","multisymbols","check nodes","symbol nodes","total error correcting ability","performance gain","256-QAM modulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel scheme of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) coded modulation system called bit-expand-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding and demapping (BEICM-ID) over Rayleigh fading channels.

Some methods discussed previously in optimization of CDMA signatures and receivers may be applied to the multiuser MIMO systems, to design the linear beamforming and receiving vectors. With a general multiuser MIMO system model, we present three different design methods based on three different criteria: (i) Minimizing the effective TSC among all users; (ii) Minimizing the total mean square error (MSE); (iii) Maximizing the sum capacity of the system.

An optimization problem is formed to minimize the handoff call dropping probability with a hard constraint on the new call blocking probability, and then is rewritten to another problem where only the new call blocking probability is involved. An analytical expression of the new call blocking probability is derived through modeling the channel occupancy situation of the system (including primary user network and CRN) through a one-dimension continuous time Markov chain instead of the commonly used two-dimension one. Then, the optimal number of reserved channels is determined by solving the aforementioned rewritten problem. The computational complexity of the proposed method is very low which enables its applications in high dynamic scenarios like CRNs.

We also compare this new algorithm with the near-optimal EE algorithm, maximum-power-decrease-first (MPDF), which is proposed in [9]. The proposed algorithm differs from the MPDF algorithm in terms of the number of waterfilling for subcarrier allocation. The waterfilling operation in our proposed algorithm is not related to the number of users so that it reduces the computational complexity significantly. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm approach the EE performance of the MPDF algorithm with lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542934","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542934.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity energy-efficient resource allocation in OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542934/","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity energy-efficient resource allocation in OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596762","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542934/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity energy-efficient resource allocation in OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"LowComplexityEnergyEfficientResourceAllocatio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044612S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542935,"authors":[{"name":"Guochen Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guochen","lastName":"Liu","id":"38519286400"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Xiuhong Su","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiuhong","lastName":"Su","id":"38520007500"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542935","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","MIMO communication","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity zero-forcing coordinated beamforming scheme","adaptive-perturbation","multicell MIMO networks","null space perturbation","intercell interference elimination","channel response","time-correlation","singular-value-decomposition","channel matrix","specific rate loss","base stations","interference strength","fixed perturbation step length"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coordinated beamforming","perturbation theory","inter-cell interference","zero-forcing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive coordinated zero-forcing beamforming scheme based on null space perturbation is proposed for eliminating the inter-cell interference in multi-cell MIMO networks.

Different from traditional schemes, which tries to detect each packet before network coding them, VBLAST-PNC detects the summation of the two packets before network coding. In particular, after firstly detecting the second layer signal in 2-by-2 MIMO system with VBLAST, we only cancel part of the detected signal, rather than canceling all the components, from the first layer. Then we directly map the obtained signal, which is a weighted summation of the first layer and the second layer, to the network coding form. With such partial interference cancellation, the error propagation effect is significantly mitigated and the performance is thus improved as shown in simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO physical layer network coding based on VBLAST detection","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542939","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542939.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MIMO physical layer network coding based on VBLAST detection","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542939/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596767","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO physical layer network coding based on VBLAST detection","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"MIMOPhysicalLayerNetworkCodingBasedonVBLASTDe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069325S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542940,"authors":[{"name":"Lihong Liu","affiliation":["E.E.

Then we derive two predictors based on the proposed model, which select data for auto-regressive (AR) modeling in different ways. The first predictor, called the best data predictor, chooses the desired data set via minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of prediction model. Yet the second predictor, called reduced-complexity subset predictor, chooses the data in a heuristic way, which aims to reduce the computational complexity. Both of the two predictors can exploit the temporal and spatial correlation adaptively.

Potential available spectrum for CRS can be from multiple primary radio systems (PRSs) with different spectrum prices, and secondary users (SUs) with heterogenous usage modes, interference punishments and service types. Choosing which primary network to access for SU brings the network selection problem. This scenario generates new opportunities for CRS to improve the system performance by exploiting heterogenous characteristics of PRSs. In this paper, we first use continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model to describe the network selection problem and derive the performance metrics. Then we intuitively propose Random and Greedy network selection strategies under this framework. Motivated by the drawbacks of those strategies, we categorize the service types of SU into Real-Time Services (RTS) and Non-Real-Time Services (NRTS) and propose an optimal network selection algorithm to maximize performance metrics based on policy iterations.

In particular, by exploiting the time-frequency relationship of OFDM, a noncoherent detector is proposed for phase-shift keying modulated signals. The proposed noncoherent detector uses only one OFDM block signal for data detection, and therefore is suitable for relatively fast time-varying environments. We show that the noncoherent detection can be cast as a quadratic maximization problem, which can be efficiently solved by the convex approximation technique, namely, semidefinite relaxation. Simulation results demonstrate that the noncoherent detector exhibits near-coherent performance and outperforms channel-estimation-aided detection methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542952.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent amplify-and-forward cooperative OFDM in block fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","convex programming","cooperative communication","fading channels","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","quadratic programming","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent amplify-and-forward cooperative OFDM system","noncoherent detection methods","frequency-selective block fading channels","phase-shift keying modulated signals","OFDM block signal","data detection","fast time-varying environments","quadratic maximization problem","convex approximation technique","semidefinite relaxation","channel-estimation-aided detection methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","amplify-and-forward","cooperative communication","noncoherent detection","block fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent amplify-and-forward cooperative OFDM in block fading channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542952/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596780","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent amplify-and-forward cooperative OFDM in block fading channels","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"NoncoherentAmplifyandForwardCooperativeOFDMin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.163457S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542955,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijiang Chang","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zhijiang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37709209500"},{"name":"Georgi Gaydadjiev","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Georgi","lastName":"Gaydadjiev","id":"37265500000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc networks","routing protocols","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network topology unstability","load balancing","proactive routing protocols","network deployment","path lifetime","route reconstruction","communication overhead reduction","ad hoc routing table calculation","intermediate nodes","power saving","network utilization problems","shortest path first-based routing algorithm","intelligent mobile terminals","mobile networking","mobile ad hoc network","improved MANET network utilization"]}],"abstract":"Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a new opportunity for mobile networking using intelligent mobile terminals. However, the widely used shortest path first based routing algorithm leads to various network utilization problems. Mobile terminals have limited power, hence, power saving should be considered when terminals serve as intermediate nodes in MANET. Furthermore, ad hoc routing table calculation is distributed among all network terminals. Therefore, we also need to construct stable paths with longer lifetime in order to reduce the communication overhead introduced by route reconstruction. A less evenly distributed traffic exhausts power on the nodes in the center of the network and leads to shorter path lifetime. Such a network deployment is not fair for the internal nodes. The above problems exist for all routing protocols especially proactive routing protocols based on shortest path first algorithm OLSR. In this paper we study the MANET network utilization in term of load distribution and path lifetime. Our careful simulation results demonstrate that the standard shortest path first algorithm leads to worse load balancing and reduced path lifetime compared to our proposal. When the most unstable network topology is considered, our proposal achieves better network utilization by reducing the peak transmission per node by 15% and the standard deviation of transmission per node by 50%. The average lifetime for established paths is doubled under the most unstable topology.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542955.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On improved MANET network utilization","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542955","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"On improved MANET network utilization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542955/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13596783","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6542955/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On improved MANET network utilization","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"OnImprovedMANETNetworkUtilization.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095022S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6542957,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofu Wu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaofu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293518500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542957","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","concatenated codes","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplicative-repetition code analysis","polar code","binary erasure channels","concatenated codes","nonbinary LDPC codes","maximum-likelihood decoding","BEC","ML decoding","distance profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiplicative-repetition codes","polar codes","maximum-likelihood decoding","binary erasure channels"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the analysis of multiplicative-repetition code and polar code over binary erasure channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542957","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542957","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542957.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","abstract":"It was recently shown that the multiplicative-repetition codes can achieve surprising excellent performance when concatenated with non-binary LDPC codes.

iterative decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE) for discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-precoded orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). The star 16QAM scheme achieves more efficient modulation compared to square 16QAM in that it decreases the actual required average received signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) satisfying the target average BLER considering the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal for a low channel coding rate. Hence, the feature of the paper is that we apply iterative DDCE using soft-decision symbol estimation based on the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of an extrinsic probability at the Max-Log-MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) decoder output to achieve an efficient modulation scheme with a low required average received SNR. Computer simulation results show that for the star 16QAM scheme, the average BLER using the iterative DDCE is very close to that with ideal channel estimation for a low channel coding rate such as an R = 1/3 turbo code. We also show that when iterative DDCE is employed, the (8, 8) star 16QAM scheme decreases the required average received SNR considering the cubic metric at the average BLER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n by approximately 0.7 dB compared to the square 16QAM scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of star 16QAM using iterative decision-directed channel estimation for DFT-precoded OFDMA","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542979","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06542979.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6542979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance of star 16QAM using iterative decision-directed channel estimation for DFT-precoded OFDMA","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542979/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596807","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of star 16QAM using iterative decision-directed channel estimation for DFT-precoded OFDMA","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"PerformanceofStar16QAMUsingIterativeDecisionD.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05179S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6542980,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hao","id":"37070133300"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292907900"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542980","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","telecommunication signalling","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","11-bit signalling information","7-bit signalling scheme","DVB-T2 standard","orthogonal Walsh sequence","OFDM system","physical layer signalling transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","physical layer signalling","Walsh sequences"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel physical layer signalling method for OFDM systems, where the signalling information is conveyed by a pair of orthogonal Walsh sequences.

For the channel state information (CSI), we assume that the CSI for the legitimate link is available and the CSI for the wiretap channel is imperfect. Our system design goal is to optimize the worst-case performance of the network under the situation: minimizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at the eavesdropper and meanwhile guaranteeing the SINR at legitimate receiver. Thus the spatial distribution of jamming signals and the beamforming vector of source are jointly optimized under a total power constraint. As this optimization problem is difficult to tackle, a method is proposed with proofs to obtain exact solver of it. Our analysis reveals that optimizing the beamforming vector of source is a better strategy compared to optimizing the spatial covariance matrix of information signals. Numerical results affirm this and show the advantage of robust transmit designs compared to a non-robust approach in lowering the SINR at the eavesdropper in the presence of channel uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6542988/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13596816","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6542988/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust QoS-based transmit beamforming design in MISO wiretap channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust QoS-based transmit beamforming design in MISO wiretap channels","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"RobustQoSBasedTransmitBeamformingDesigninMISO.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071822S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6542988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6542990,"authors":[{"name":"Lan Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37288310700"},{"name":"Xinggan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xinggan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38007367400"},{"name":"Yechao Bai","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yechao","lastName":"Bai","id":"38003883200"},{"name":"Pengcheng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37402801500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6542990","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","quality of service","video coding","video communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable video broadcast","multiuser OFDM systems","multiuser wireless channels","quality-of-services","QoS requirements","scarce radio resources","scalable video coding","OFDM technique","diverse requirements","heterogeneous mobile users","cross-layer resource allocation scheme","scalable video transmission","video quality layers","base layer","multiple-enhancement layers","suboptimal subcarrier allocation algorithm","bit allocation algorithm","power allocation algorithm","total transmit power minimization","video quality","single-layer coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Scalable video coding","Resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Video transmission on multiuser wireless channels faces great challenges due to diverse Quality of services (QoS) requirements, harsh wireless channels and scarce radio resources.

However, the recursive feedback encoding method will introduce error propagation in the case where the channel frequency response (CFR) has abrupt changes between adjacent subcarriers. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a periodic recursive feedback encoding method in this paper. Through using a full-size codebook periodically across subcarriers, the error propagation problem can be avoided. Additionally, we propose a modified clustering method to reduce the feedback load. In this method, the receiver informs the transmitter of new optimal precoding matrix only when the current optimal precoding matrix is different from the former, which makes the feedback more efficient. Simulation results demonstrate the effective of our proposed approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on feedback reduction techniques in MIMO-OFDM beamforming systems","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543001","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06543001.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6543001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6543001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Study on feedback reduction techniques in MIMO-OFDM beamforming systems","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6543001/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596829","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on feedback reduction techniques in MIMO-OFDM beamforming systems","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"StudyonFeedbackReductionTechniquesinMIMOOFDMB.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091309S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6543001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6543006,"authors":[{"name":"De-Li Jia","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"De-Li","lastName":"Jia","id":"37070239700"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Shao-Qian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Shao-Qian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6543006","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna arrays","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO transmission modes","downlink LTE systems","multiple transmission modes","multiple-input multi-output systems","communication link","3GPP LTE standards","interferences","downlink multicell LTE environment","transmit-receive antenna correlation","neighboring cells"]}],"abstract":"Multiple transmission modes are allowed to be used in multiple-input multi-output (MIMO) LTE systems. Some previous literatures suggested that with the same transmission power, different MIMO transmission modes have different interferences on desired communication link. However, these works only considered ideal communication environment, none of them investigated the case in practical environment according to 3GPP LTE standards. Until now, the impact of different MIMO transmission modes in LTE network is still not known. In this paper, we investigate the interferences of different MIMO modes. Our works show that in downlink multi-cell LTE environment, different MIMO modes would generate different interference under different transmit/receive antenna correlation cases. Our study demonstrates that the transmission mode deployed at neighboring cells is also a factor which affects the performance of desired link.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543006","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06543006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The interference of MIMO transmission modes in downlink LTE systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6543006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The interference of MIMO transmission modes in downlink LTE systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6543006/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596834","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6543006/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The interference of MIMO transmission modes in downlink LTE systems","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"TheInterferenceofMIMOTransmissionModesinDownl.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143394S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6543006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6543011,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Shen","affiliation":["Communications Theory, Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Shen","id":"38495458300"},{"name":"Eduard Jorswieck","affiliation":["Communications Theory, Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Jorswieck","id":"37275005700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6543011","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"abstract":"Femtocells deployed in the Macrocell network provide better indoor coverage to the user equipments (UEs) with low power consumption and maintenance cost from the wireless system vendor. The industrial vendors show great interest in the access mode, called the hybrid access, in which the macrocell UEs (MUEs) can be served by the nearby Femtocell Access Point (FAP). By adopting hybrid access in the femtocell, the system energy efficiency is improved due to the short distance between the FAP and MUEs while at the same time, the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements are better guaranteed. However, both the Macrocell base station (MBS) and the FAP are rational and selfish, who maximize their own utility. The framework to successively apply the hybrid access in femtocell and fulfill the QoS requirement of each UE is of great importance. In this paper, we propose a compensation framework with universal nonlinear pricing, which serves to optimize the power allocation in uplink transmission, to motivate the hybrid access. The optimal compensation price and the number of acceptable MUEs are provided, where the utility of the MBS and FAP are maximized, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06543011.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6543011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User-centric compensation framework with universal pricing for hybrid femtocell networks","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","compensation","femtocellular radio","indoor radio","optimisation","pricing","quality of service","radio equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user centric compensation framework","MBS","optimal compensation price","uplink transmission","power allocation optimization","universal nonlinear pricing","macrocell base station","QoS","quality of service","FAP","energy efficiency","hybrid access","femtocell access point","MUE","macrocell UE","industrial vendor","wireless system vendor","user equipment","indoor coverage","macrocell network","hybrid femtocell network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QoS requirement","compensation function","pricing","hybrid access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6543011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"User-centric compensation framework with universal pricing for hybrid femtocell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6543011/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596839","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User-centric compensation framework with universal pricing for hybrid femtocell networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"UsercentricCompensationFrameworkwithUniversal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058572S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6543011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6543016,"authors":[{"name":"Feiran Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feiran","lastName":"Wang","id":"37070181800"},{"name":"Chen Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Xu","id":"38519031900"},{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingyang","lastName":"Song","id":"37288632100"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Houston, Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37278605300"},{"name":"Baoxian Zhang","affiliation":["Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Baoxian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37070460300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6543016","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1124},"abstract":"Device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks brings significant benefits to resource utilization, improving user's throughput and extending battery life of user equipments.

In this paper, we propose a novel joint radio resource and power allocation scheme to improve the performance of the system in the uplink period. Energy efficiency is considered as our optimization objective since devices are handheld equipments with limited battery life. We formulate the the allocation problem as a reverse iterative combinatorial auction game. In the auction, radio resources occupied by cellular users are considered as bidders competing for D2D packages and their corresponding transmit power. We propose an algorithm to solve the allocation problem as an auction game. We also perform numerical simulations to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526528/6542768/06543016.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2012.6543016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6543016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient radio resource and power allocation for device-to-device communication underlaying cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","iterative methods","mobile handsets","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient radio resource allocation scheme","energy-efficient radio power allocation scheme","device-to-device communication","cellular networks","D2D communication","interference","uplink period","handheld equipments","reverse iterative combinatorial auction game","cellular users","bidders","numerical simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6543016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient radio resource and power allocation for device-to-device communication underlaying cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6543016/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13596844","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient radio resource and power allocation for device-to-device communication underlaying cellular networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"EnergyEfficientRadioResourceandPowerAllocatio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045684S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6543016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6543019,"authors":[{"name":"Jhin-Fang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhin-Fang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281261900"},{"name":"Wen-Cheng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Cheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"38548569800"},{"name":"Yan-Cheng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yan-Cheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37595558400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5830-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5829-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6543019","dbTime":"48 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","radar receivers","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gm-C bandpass filter chip design","wireless application","Butterworth bandpass filter","leap frog Gm-C structure","intermediate frequency receiver","IF receiver","differential Nauta transconductors","frequency range","single-to-differential converter","differential output","filter usage","frequency 100 MHz","frequency 20 MHz","size 0.35 mum","voltage 3.3 V","frequency 94.45 MHz","frequency 25 MHz","size 0.475 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["band-pass filter","Nauta transconductors","Gm-C"]}],"abstract":"A sixth-order Butterworth bandpass filter using a leap-frog G\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n-C structure for wireless applications is proposed.

Monte Carlo simulation results show that, dual-relay cooperative transmission strategy further increases conflict-free transmission time of secondary users than single-relay cooperative transmission and reduce BER Dual-relay cooperative transmission significantly improves the transmission performance of system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6543023/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13596851","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6543023/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A cooperative transmission scheme of secondary user in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cooperative transmission scheme of secondary user in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"ACooperativeTransmissionSchemeofSecondaryUser.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050803S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526528","isNumber":"6542768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526528","xplore-issue":"6542768","articleId":"6543023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6543038,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Gisquet","affiliation":["Canon Research France, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Gisquet","id":"37070078500"},{"name":"Edouard Fran\u00e7ois","affiliation":["Canon Research France, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Edouard","lastName":"Fran\u00e7ois","id":"37294820700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4965-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6037-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-0314"}],"articleNumber":"6543038","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Encoding","Predictive models","Image reconstruction","Correlation","Transforms","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","image coding","linear parameters","luma samples","chroma samples","linear model","luma signal","chroma signal","HEVC standardization project","LM mode","interchannel coding mode","model correction","cross channel chroma prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HEVC","video coding","cross-channel predictin","LM mode"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6543038","abstract":"A new inter-channel coding mode named LM mode has been intensively explored in the HEVC standardization project.

As expected, the improvement on coding efficiency is obtained at the expense of more intensive computation complexity. In this paper, based on an overall analysis of computation complexity in HEVC encoder, a low complexity rate distortion optimization (RDO) coding scheme is proposed by reducing the number of available candidates for evaluation in terms of the intra prediction mode decision, reference frame selection and CU splitting. With the proposed scheme, the RDO technique of HEVC can be implemented in a low-complexity way for complexity-constrained encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the original HEVC reference encoder implementation, the proposed algorithms can achieve about 30% reduced encoding time on average with ignorable coding performance degradation (0.8%).","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2013.15","publicationTitle":"2013 Data Compression Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542297/6543027/06543043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2013.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6543027","startPage":"73","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Rate Distortion Optimization for HEVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6543043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Rate Distortion Optimization for HEVC","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6543043/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 March 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13596906","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6543043/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Rate Distortion Optimization for HEVC","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"4965a073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067418S","chronDate":"20-22 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542297","isNumber":"6543027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542297","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6543027","articleId":"6543043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6543069,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38241230600"},{"name":"Debin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Debin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277017000"},{"name":"Feng Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37414830600"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37275735100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4965-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6037-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-0314"}],"articleNumber":"6543069","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":941},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Compressed sensing","Adaptation models","Image coding","Vectors","Transforms","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","convergence","fractals","image coding","image representation","image sampling","iterative methods","Nyquist criterion","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structural group sparse representation","image compressive sensing recovery","signal decoding","Nyquist sampling theory","natural signal nonstationarity","sparse signal","SGSR","image sparsity","image self-similarity","adaptive group domain","iterative thresholding algorithm","optimization","convergence","iterative shrinkage algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","image recovery","sparsity","structural group sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"Compressive Sensing (CS) theory shows that a signal can be decoded from many fewer measurements than suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory, when the signal is sparse in some domain. Most of conventional CS recovery approaches, however, exploited a set of fixed bases (e.g. DCT, wavelet, contour let and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal, which are irrespective of the nonstationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity, thus resulting in poor rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery via structural group sparse representation (SGSR) modeling, which enforces image sparsity and self-similarity simultaneously under a unified framework in an adaptive group domain, thus greatly confining the CS solution space. In addition, an efficient iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm based technique is developed to solve the above optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel CS recovery strategy achieves significant performance improvements over the current state-of-the-art schemes and exhibits nice convergence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural Group Sparse Representation for Image Compressive Sensing Recovery","publicationTitle":"2013 Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2013.41","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542297/6543027/06543069.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2013.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6543027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6543069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6543069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Structural Group Sparse Representation for Image Compressive Sensing Recovery","conferenceDate":"20-22 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6543069/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13596932","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural Group Sparse Representation for Image Compressive Sensing Recovery","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"4965a331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088505S","chronDate":"20-22 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542297","isNumber":"6543027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542297","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6543027","articleId":"6543069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6543089,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37069977500"},{"name":"Marcin Rutkowski","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Rutkowski","id":"37070364600"},{"name":"Christopher Fenner","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Fenner","id":"37070187000"},{"name":"Robert C.

Numerical computations have accelerated significantly since 2005 thanks to two complementary, silicon-enabled trends: multi-core processing and single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) accelerators. Unfortunately, due to fundamental limitations of physics, these two trends could not be accompanied by a corresponding increase in memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth. High-performance computing (HPC) is the proverbial \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d of multi-core processing. When HPC hits a multi-core will likely encounter a similar limit in few years. We describe the computationally efficient (Fig 1b) and adaptive APplication AXceleration (APAX) numerical encoding method to reduce the memory wall for integers and floating-point operands. APAX achieves encoding rates between 3:1 and 10:1 without changing the dataset's statistical or spectral characteristics. APAX encoding takes advantage of three characteristics of all numerical sequences: peak-to-average ratio, oversampling, and effective number of bits (ENOB). Uncertainty quantification and spectral methods quantify the degree of uncertainty (accuracy) in numerical datasets. APAX profiler creates a rate-correlation graph with recommended operating signals, and fundamental limit, consumer point, provides 18 quantitative metrics comparing the original and decoded displays input and residual spectra with a residual histogram.

However, challenge that still remains is to prove the convergence of this class of learning algorithms since the geometrical structure of the data space is considered. This paper presents the convergence properties of the graph regularized NMF learning algorithms. In the analysis, we focus on the study of Euclidian distance based algorithms. The structures of the fixed points are presented. The non-divergence of the learning algorithms is analyzed by constructing invariant sets for update rules. Based on Lyapunov indirect method, the stability of the algorithms is discussed in detail. The analysis shows that this class of NMF algorithms can converge to their fixed points under some given conditions. In the simulations, theoretical results presented in the paper are confirmed. For different initializations and data sets, variations of cost functions and decomposition data in the learning are presented to show the convergence features of the discussed NMF update rules, and the convergence speed of the algorithms is also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2013.98","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6871455/06544182.pdf","startPage":"2151","endPage":"2165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2013.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6871455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Graph Regularized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Graph Regularized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization","volume":"26","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14525932","htmlLink":"/document/6544182/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence Analysis of Graph Regularized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization","sourcePdf":"tkde-yi-98-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110002S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6871455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6871455","articleId":"6544182","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544186,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Endres","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6687161/6544186/6544186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ian Endres received the BS degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2008.

Two SDs specifically designed for SM are proposed and analysed in terms of Bit Error Ratio (BER) and computational complexity. Using Monte Carlo simulations and mathematical analysis, it is shown that by carefully choosing the initial radius the proposed sphere decoder algorithms offer the same BER as ML detection, with a significant reduction in the computational complexity. A tight closed form expression for the BER performance of SM-SD is derived in the paper, along with an algorithm for choosing the initial radius which provides near to optimum performance. Also, it is shown that none of the proposed SDs are always superior to the others, but the best SD to use depends on the target spectral efficiency. The computational complexity trade-off offered by the proposed solutions is studied via analysis and simulation, and is shown to validate our findings. Finally, the performance of SM-SDs are compared to Spatial Multiplexing (SMX) applying ML decoder and applying SD. It is shown that for the same spectral efficiency, SM-SD offers up to 84% reduction in complexity compared to SMX-SD, with up to 1 dB better BER performance than SMX-ML decoder.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061013.120547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6569166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061013.120547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6569166/06544189.pdf","startPage":"2805","endPage":"2815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalised Sphere Decoding for Spatial Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Generalised Sphere Decoding for Spatial Modulation","volume":"61","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544189/","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13656059","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544189/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalised Sphere Decoding for Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"2805-tc1307-younis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153951S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6569166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6569166","articleId":"6544189","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544192,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongwei Si","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6583513/6544192/6544192-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongwei Si (S'08) received her B.Eng. degree in 2004 and M.Eng. degree in 2007, both from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China.

Meanwhile, both codes enable the highest transmission rate possible with DF relaying for a wide range of channel parameters. In addition, the regular degree distributions can easily be computed from the channel parameters, which significantly simplifies the code optimization. The code construction and performance analysis are extended to the general binary memoryless symmetric channel, where a capacity-achieving performance is conjectured.

Using a geometrical framework, an analytical expression for the upper bound on the total rate loss due to limited channel feedback is derived. The rate loss is a function of the total feedback budget available to the receiver, the strength of the desired and the interfering links at the users and the network parameters. This rate loss upper bound metric is then minimized at each receiver locally by allocating the feedback bits optimally among the links observed by it. We obtain an interesting result that under limited channel feedback budget at the users, interference alignment (IA) may not be the appropriate beamforming strategy. Based on the feedback bit allocation policy to minimize the rate loss upper bound at the receiver and the corresponding channel quantization error statistics at the transmitter, an improved beamformer design is proposed. The proposed beamformer shows a higher throughput gain compared to all other existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061013.120695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6583513/06544195.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061013.120695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583513","startPage":"3246","endPage":"3258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamformer Design for the MIMO Interference Channels under Limited Channel Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beamformer Design for the MIMO Interference Channels under Limited Channel Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13709600","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544195/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamformer Design for the MIMO Interference Channels under Limited Channel Feedback","sourcePdf":"3246-tc1308-anan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085002S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6583513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6583513","articleId":"6544195","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544196,"authors":[{"name":"Navod Suraweera","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Navod","lastName":"Suraweera","id":"37085468040"},{"name":"Norman C.

To achieve the full diversity order, we further propose alternative power allocation and relay selection methods by simply replacing the statistical channel information of the first scheme with instantaneous one. The diversity order of the second scheme is then verified by deriving the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding asymptotic overall outage probability.

First, the coupled higher order dynamic model of an n-link robot manipulator is introduced briefly. Then, a conventional backstepping control (BSC) scheme is developed for the joint position tracking of the robot manipulator. Moreover, a fuzzy-neural-network-inherited BSC (FNNIBSC) scheme is proposed to relax the requirement of detailed system information to improve the robustness of BSC and to deal with the serious chattering that is caused by the discontinuous function. In the FNNIBSC strategy, the FNN framework is designed to mimic the BSC law, and adaptive tuning algorithms for network parameters are derived in the sense of the projection algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance. Numerical simulations and experimental results of a two-link robot manipulator that are actuated by dc servomotors are provided to justify the claims of the proposed FNNIBSC system, and the superiority of the proposed FNNIBSC scheme is also evaluated by quantitative comparison with previous intelligent control schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2270010","startPage":"709","endPage":"722","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy

scales. The classification model constructed on samples extracted from a limited region of the image, called source domain, exhibits generally poor accuracies when used to predict the samples of a different region, called target domain, due to possible changes in class distributions throughout the image. To alleviate this problem, we suggest selecting and labeling additional samples from the new domain in order to improve generalization capabilities of the model. We propose to implement an initialization strategy based on clustering before applying the traditional active learning method in order to cope with distribution changes and better explore the feature space of the target domain. Experiments on a MODIS dataset for the generation of a land-cover map at European scale show good capabilities of the proposed approach for this purpose.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale Image Classification Using Active Learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2013.2255258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6658878/06544206.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2013.2255258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6658878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Image Classification Using Active Learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6544206/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13887919","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Image Classification Using Active Learning","sourcePdf":"lgrs-melgani-2255258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066765S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6658878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6658878","articleId":"6544206","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544209,"authors":[{"name":"Ludovic Danjean","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ludovic","lastName":"Danjean","id":"38193535800"},{"name":"Bane Vasi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Bane","lastName":"Vasi\u0107","id":"37274466600"},{"name":"Michael W.

A challenge within it is to model various signs, varying with time resolution, visual manual appearance, and so on. In this paper, we propose a discriminative exemplar coding (DEC) approach, as well as utilizing Kinect sensor, to model various signs. The proposed DEC method can be summarized as three steps. First, a quantity of class-specific candidate exemplars are learned from sign language videos in each sign category by considering their discrimination. Then, every video of all signs is described as a set of similarities between frames within it and the candidate exemplars. Instead of simply using a heuristic distance measure, the similarities are decided by a set of exemplar-based classifiers through the multiple instance learning, in which a positive (or negative) video is treated as a positive (or negative) bag and those frames similar to the given exemplar in Euclidean space as instances. Finally, we formulate the selection of the most discriminative exemplars into a framework and simultaneously produce a sign video classifier to recognize sign. To evaluate our method, we collect an American sign language dataset, which includes approximately 2000 phrases, while each phrase is captured by Kinect sensor with color, depth, and skeleton information. Experimental results on our dataset demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for sign language recognition.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2013.2265337","startPage":"1418","endPage":"1428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6595583/06544211.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2013.2265337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative Exemplar Coding for Sign Language Recognition With Kinect","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","handicapped aids","image classification","image colour analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","sign language recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative exemplar coding","sign language recognition","Kinect sensor","computer vision","time resolution","visual manual appearance","DEC approach","class-specific candidate exemplar","sign language video","exemplar-based classifier","multiple instance learning","Euclidean space","sign video classifier","American sign language dataset","color information","depth information","skeleton information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discriminative exemplar coding","Kinect sensor","sign language recognition"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Actigraphy","Actigraphy","Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Peripherals","Computer Simulation","Computer Systems","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Enhancement","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Sign Language","Transducers","Video Games","Whole Body Imaging","Whole Body Imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative Exemplar Coding for Sign Language Recognition With Kinect","volume":"43","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6544211/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13767437","pubMedId":"23797313","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative Exemplar Coding for Sign Language Recognition With Kinect","sourcePdf":"tcyb-xu-2265337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108695S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6595583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6595583","articleId":"6544211","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6544218,"authors":[{"name":"Cunren Liang","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6680673/6544218/6544218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cunren Liang (S'10) is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with Peking University, Beijing, China.","He has been involved in the research of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing and SAR interferometry, particularly multimode SAR interferometry."]},"firstName":"Cunren","lastName":"Liang","id":"37593881300"},{"name":"Qiming Zeng","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6680673/6544218/6544218-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Qiming Zeng (M'97) received the B.S. degree in physics, the M.S. degree in cartography and remote sensing, and the Ph.D. degree in cartography and remote sensing from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1985, 1988, and 2001, respectively.","He joined the Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System, Peking University, in 1988, where he is currently a Professor.

Many algorithms have been proposed to focus ScanSAR burst with its phase preserved so that the focused burst can be used in interferometry to acquire large scale geophysical information, such as land deformation and digital elevation model. However, nearly all of the algorithms leave the focused burst with an additional quadratic phase term that will affect subsequent interferometric processing in the case of short burst. With this phase term, the spectrum of the focused burst is altered according to the principle of stationary phase. Therefore, some processing, such as bandpass filtering, cannot produce desired results if routinely performed. To avoid the effects of the phase term and the nonstationary azimuth spectrum of the burst, a phase compensation scheme is suggested, combining with current focusing algorithms. Simulation experiments are designed to show the effects of the phase term on bandpass filtering. These effects are further verified by a few experiments using real SAR data in unsynchronized signal removal that is frequently required in repeat-pass ScanSAR interferometry. The new phase compensation scheme is tested in real SAR data experiments and works well.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","matched filters","radar interferometry","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase compensation","short ScanSAR burst","long matched filter","interferometric processing","scanning synthetic aperture radar","large scale geophysical information","land deformation","digital elevation model","bandpass filtering","SAR data","unsynchronized signal removal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Burst","focusing","interferometry","matched filter","quadratic phase term","ScanSAR","SPECAN","synchronization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2249589","startPage":"1299","endPage":"1310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6680673/06544218.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2249589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Phase Compensation of Short ScanSAR Burst Focused by Long Matched Filter for Interferometric Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Phase Compensation of Short ScanSAR Burst Focused by Long Matched Filter for Interferometric Processing","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13969705","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","volume":"52","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544218/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Phase Compensation of Short ScanSAR Burst Focused by Long Matched Filter for Interferometric Processing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-liang-2249589-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071384S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6680673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6680673","articleId":"6544218","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6544220,"authors":[{"name":"Hanjie Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6555827/6544220/6544220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hanjie Pan (S'11) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1988.

As usual, the reconstructed image is the minimum of an objective functional that consists of a data fidelity term and an \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n regularization. However, instead of estimating the reconstructed image that minimizes the objective functional directly, we focus on the restoration process that maps the degraded measurements to the reconstruction. Our idea amounts to parameterize the process as a linear combination of few elementary thresholding functions (LET) and to solve the linear weighting coefficients by minimizing the objective functional. It is then possible to update the thresholding functions and to iterate this process ( i-LET). The key advantage of such a linear parametrization is that the problem size reduces dramatically-each time we only need to solve an optimization problem over the dimension of the linear coefficients (typically less than 10) instead of the whole image dimension. With the elementary thresholding functions satisfying certain constraints, a global convergence of the iterated LET algorithm is guaranteed. Experiments on several test images over a wide range of noise levels and different types of convolution kernels clearly indicate that the proposed framework usually outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both the CPU time and the number of iterations.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2270109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2270109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6555827","startPage":"3715","endPage":"3728","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6555827/06544220.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544220","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","image restoration","iterative methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative linear expansion","\u21131-based image restoration","algorithmic framework","sparsity assumptions","image reconstruction","data fidelity term","degraded measurements","elementary thresholding function","linear weighting coefficients","linear parametrization","optimization problem","image dimension","iterated LET algorithm","noise level","convolution kernels","CPU time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image restoration","sparsity","majorization minimization (MM)","iterative reweighted least square (IRLS)","thresholding","linear expansion of thresholds (LET)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Linear Expansion of Thresholds for <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_{1}$</tex></formula>-Based Image Restoration","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13696762","pubMedId":"23797257","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544220/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544220/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Linear Expansion of Thresholds for <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ell_{1}$</tex></formula>-Based Image Restoration","sourcePdf":"tip-pan-2270109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165619S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6555827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6555827","articleId":"6544220","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6544227,"authors":[{"name":"Linxia Liao","affiliation":["Siemens Corporation, Corporate Technology, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6637065/6544227/6544227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Linxia Liao received the B.S. degree in mechanical manufacture and automation and the M.S. degree in mechanical and electronic engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, and the Ph.D. in industrial engineering from the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.","Currently, he is a Research Scientist at Siemens Corporation, Corporate Technology in the U.S. His main research interests include system and components fault diagnostics and prognostics, health management and their integration on embedded systems."]},"firstName":"Linxia","lastName":"Liao","id":"37075684600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"6544227","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2175},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"abstract":"In prognostics approaches, features (e.g., vibration level, root mean square or outputs from signal processing techniques) extracted from the measurement (e.g., vibration, current, and pressure, etc.) are often used or modeled as an indicator to the equipment's health condition. When faults are detected or when increasing/decreasing trends are shown in the health indicator, prediction algorithms are applied to extrapolate the future behavior and predict remaining useful life (RUL). However, it is difficult to make an accurate prediction if the trend of the health indicator is not obvious through the entire life cycle or if the trend is only shown right before a failure occurs. The challenge lies in whether an advanced feature (e.g., a mathematical combination of a group of the extracted features) can be found to clearly present/correlate with the fault progression. A genetic programming method is proposed to address the challenge of automatically discovering advanced feature(s), which can well capture the fault progression, from the measurement or extracted features in the purpose of RUL prediction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

In some cases, such as space systems, FIR filters are exposed to radiation sources that cause errors. A number of techniques can be used to protect against those errors. One of them is the use of an arithmetic residue replica of the FIR filter. This replica has a lower cost than the original filter and therefore reduces the overhead compared with replicating the filter. However, some errors may not be detected by the arithmetic residue replica. In this brief, schemes that avoid undetected errors are presented. The proposed techniques are implemented and evaluated showing that they can detect all single errors affecting register bits. The results also show that their implementation requires only a small overhead in circuit complexity for the existing residue-based fault-tolerant FIR filters.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2013.2261183","startPage":"497","endPage":"501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2013.2261183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/6578080/06544260.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Arithmetic-Residue-Based SEU-Tolerant FIR Filter Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544260/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Arithmetic-Residue-Based SEU-Tolerant FIR Filter Design","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6544260/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13706217","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Arithmetic-Residue-Based SEU-Tolerant FIR Filter Design","sourcePdf":"tcsii-reviriego-2261183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059272S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6578080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6578080","articleId":"6544260","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6544269,"authors":[{"name":"Nuntawat Thitichaiworakorn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6714460/6544269/6544269-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nuntawat Thitichaiworakorn was born in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1983.

A decoder is more likely to deplete degree-1 encoding symbols and terminate during early stage when the code length is short. In this work, we modify the robust Soliton distribution (RSD) and increase the degree-1 proportion. More degree-1 encoding symbols can be generated to relieve early decoding termination. The proportion of low degrees, except for degree-1, is also reduced. Therefore, receivers collect less encoding symbols carrying redundant information. In addition, Non-Repetitive (NR) encoding scheme is proposed to avoid producing repeated degree-1 encoding symbols. To improve video transmission quality, previous studies redesign LT codes to provide Unequal Error Protection (UEP) for different Scalable Video Coding (SVC) layers. Unlike those studies to modify the code structure, we integrate multiple NR encoders to achieve UEP ability. Experimental results show that our UEP scheme outperforms previous studies in terms of the PSNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Non-Repetitive LT Encoders With Modified Distribution to Achieve Unequal Erasure Protection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2269898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6663669/06544282.pdf","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2269898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Non-Repetitive LT Encoders With Modified Distribution to Achieve Unequal Erasure Protection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6544282/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13896750","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Non-Repetitive LT Encoders With Modified Distribution to Achieve Unequal Erasure Protection","sourcePdf":"tmm-yen-2269898-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087143S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6663669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6663669","articleId":"6544282","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6544286,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Soon Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6632912/6544286/6544286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang-Soon Lim received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include modeling and control of power converter systems for renewable energies and battery charger."]},"firstName":"Chang-Soon","lastName":"Lim","id":"37598820800"},{"name":"Kui-Jun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6632912/6544286/6544286-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Kui-Jun Lee received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2012, respectively.","Since 2012, he has been with the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management Systems Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh.

Since this type of equalizer requires voltage sensing circuits for each battery cell, the size and cost of the overall equalizer system increase. In this paper, a novel switching method, which does not require voltage sensing circuits, is proposed for the SCEMT. However, due to the problems related to the implementation of multiwinding in a single transformer, the SCEMT is definitely difficult to apply to long series-connected lithium-ion battery string. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a novel module charge equalizer based on the configuration of the SCEMT is developed. Unlike the conventional module charge equalizer using additional components, the proposed novel module charge equalizer utilizes the magnetizing energy of the multiwinding transformer for the equalization among modules. Therefore, proposed module charge equalizer does not suffer from the size, cost, and loss related to the modularization. The validity of the proposed module charge equalizer is verified through experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2270000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2270000","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6632912/06544286.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modularized Equalization Method Based on Magnetizing Energy for a Series-Connected Lithium-Ion Battery String","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Modularized Equalization Method Based on Magnetizing Energy for a Series-Connected Lithium-Ion Battery String","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544286/","accessionNumber":"13843321","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544286/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modularized Equalization Method Based on Magnetizing Energy for a Series-Connected Lithium-Ion Battery String","sourcePdf":"tpel-kim-2270000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104093S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6544286","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6544287,"authors":[{"name":"Anh-Huy Phan","affiliation":["Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Wako, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6587530/6544287/6544287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anh-Huy Phan (M'13) received the master degree from Hochiminh University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan, in 2011.","He worked as Deputy head of Research and Development Department, Broadcast Research and Application Center, Vietnam Television, and is currently Research Scientist at the Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing, and a visiting research scientist in Toyota Collaboration Center, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN.

The method also reduces the extra memory requirements of CP algorithms. As a result, we can accelerate the standard alternating CP algorithms 20-30 times for order-5 and order-6 tensors, and even higher ratios can be obtained for higher order tensors (e.g., N \u2265 10).

Most of the existing IA designs require full channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, which induces a huge CSI signaling cost. Hence it is desirable to improve the feedback efficiency for IA and in this paper, we propose a novel IA scheme with a significantly reduced CSI feedback. To quantify the CSI feedback cost, we introduce a novel metric, namely the feedback dimension. This metric serves as a first-order measurement of CSI feedback overhead. Due to the partial CSI feedback constraint, conventional IA schemes can not be applied and hence, we develop a novel IA precoder/decorrelator design and establish new IA feasibility conditions. Via dynamic feedback profile design, the proposed IA scheme can also achieve a flexible tradeoff between the degree of freedom (DoF) requirements for data streams, the antenna resources and the CSI feedback cost. We show by analysis and simulations that the proposed scheme achieves substantial reductions of CSI feedback overhead under the same DoF requirement in MIMO interference networks.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2269902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6578576/06544291.pdf","startPage":"4428","endPage":"4437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2269902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSI Feedback Reduction for MIMO Interference Alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544291/","displayDocTitle":"CSI Feedback Reduction for MIMO Interference Alignment","volume":"61","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13706402","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSI Feedback Reduction for MIMO Interference Alignment","sourcePdf":"tsp-rao-2269902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036549S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2013","isNumber":"6578576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","articleId":"6544291","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544293,"authors":[{"name":"Layong Luo","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6832672/6544293/6544293-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Layong Luo received the B.S. degree in electronic science and technology from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.","His research interests include programmable virtual routers and high-performance packet lookup algorithms."]},"firstName":"Layong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37714596800"},{"name":"Gaogang Xie","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6832672/6544293/6544293-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Gaogang Xie (M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2002.","He is currently a Professor and Director of Network Technology Research Center with the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.

The ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)-based IP lookup engine and the static random access memory (SRAM)-based IP lookup pipeline are the two most common ways to achieve high throughput. However, route updates in both engines degrade lookup performance and may lead to packet drops. Moreover, there is a growing interest in virtual IP routers where more frequent updates happen. Finding solutions that achieve both fast lookup and low update overhead becomes critical. In this paper, we propose a hybrid IP lookup architecture to address this challenge. The architecture is based on an efficient trie partitioning scheme that divides the forwarding information base (FIB) into two prefix sets: a large disjoint leaf prefix set mapped into an external TCAM-based lookup engine and a small overlapping prefix set mapped into an on-chip SRAM-based lookup pipeline. Critical optimizations are developed on both IP lookup engines to reduce the update overhead. We show how to extend the proposed hybrid architecture to support virtual routers. Our implementation shows a throughput of 250 million lookups per second (equivalent to 128 Gb/s with 64-B packets). The update overhead is significantly lower than that of previous work, the memory consumption is reasonable, and the utilization ratio of most external TCAMs is up to 100%.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2266665","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/6832672/06544293.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2266665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Hardware Architecture for High-Speed IP Lookups and Fast Route Updates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544293/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Hardware Architecture for High-Speed IP Lookups and Fast Route Updates","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14397205","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544293/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Hardware Architecture for High-Speed IP Lookups and Fast Route Updates","sourcePdf":"tnet-luo-2266665-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084849S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6832672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6832672","articleId":"6544293","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6544296,"authors":[{"name":"Jisheng Dai","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6632919/6544296/6544296-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jisheng Dai (S'08\u2013M'11) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2010.","He was a Research Assistant with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2009.

Unlike the existing method that performs linear programming as an additional step to track the optimality condition path in a multidimensional feasible space, our new approach provides a simpler and computationally more efficient implementation, which needs no extra time-consuming procedures other than introducing a random ridge term to each data point. Contrary to the existing ridge-adding method, which fails to avoid singularities as the ridge terms tend to zero, our novel approach, for any small random ridge terms, guarantees the existence of the inverse matrix by ensuring that only one index is added into or removed from the active set. The performance of the proposed algorithm, in terms of both computational complexity and the ability of singularity avoidance, is manifested by rigorous mathematical analyses as well as experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2262180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6632919/06544296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2262180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632919","startPage":"1736","endPage":"1748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the SVMpath Singularity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the SVMpath Singularity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13843245","pubMedId":"24808608","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544296/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the SVMpath Singularity","sourcePdf":"tnnls-dai-2262180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101956S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6632919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6632919","articleId":"6544296","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544298,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science of Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6803904/6544298/wu-2263397-small.gif","p":["Xiaowen Wu (S'12) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008.

Traditionally, to maximize design flexibility, interchip and intrachip communication architectures are separately designed under different constraints. Jointly designing communication architectures for both interchip and intrachip communication could, however, potentially yield better solutions. In this paper, we present a unified inter/intrachip optical network, called UNION, for chip multiprocessors (CMPs). UNION is based on recent progresses in nanophotonic technologies. It connects not only cores on a single CMP, but also multiple CMPs in a system. UNION employs a hierarchical optical network to separate interchip communication traffic from intrachip communication traffic. It fully utilizes a single optical network to transmit both payload and control packets. The network controller on each CMP not only manages intrachip communications, but also collaborates with each other to facilitate interchip communications. We compared UNION with a matched electrical counterpart in 45-nm process. Simulation results for eight real CMP applications show that on average UNION improves CMP performance by 3\u00d7 while reducing 88% of network energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2263397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6803904/06544298.pdf","startPage":"1082","endPage":"1095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2263397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UNION: A Unified Inter/Intrachip Optical Network for Chip Multiprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"UNION: A Unified Inter/Intrachip Optical Network for Chip Multiprocessors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544298/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14252215","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544298/","volume":"22","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UNION: A Unified Inter/Intrachip Optical Network for Chip Multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wu-2263397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145288S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6803904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6803904","articleId":"6544298","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544299,"authors":[{"name":"Tang-Nian Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6671940/6544299/6544299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tang-Nian Luo (S'07) was born in Yi-Lan, Taiwan, in 1980.

To overcome the difficulty of high dimensionality of resulting features, it is a common practice that MPs are extracted from principal components (PCs). In this paper, we investigate another technique on spectral feature selection, which is unsupervised band selection (BS). We find out that using selected bands as spectral features can improve classification performance because they contain more critical characteristics for classification; in particular, using the selected bands, combined with the MPs extracted from PCs, can yield the highest accuracy, due to the fact that major PCs contain less noise for extracting more reliable MPs. The overall unsupervised nature of feature selection provides the flexibility of implementation. We believe that such finding is instructive to feature selection and extraction for spectral/spatial-based hyperspectral image classification.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2265697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6689357/06544306.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2265697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689357","startPage":"40","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Band Selection and Morphological Profiles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Band Selection and Morphological Profiles","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13990271","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544306/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Band Selection and Morphological Profiles","sourcePdf":"jstars-tan-2265697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084003S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6689357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6689357","articleId":"6544306","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544307,"authors":[{"name":"Jusung Kim","affiliation":["Texas A&M University College Station, College Station, TX, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6583962/6544307/6544307-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jusung Kim (S'10\u2013M'12) received the B.S. degree (with highest honors) from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2011, both in electrical engineering.","In the summer of 2008, he was an Analog IC Design Engineer with Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA, where he designed an RF front-ends for multistandard analog and digital TV silicon tuners.

The key feature of the proposed receiver front-end is a single low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) driving a current-mode passive mixer terminated by a low-input-impedance transimpedance amplifier (TIA). The receiver chain has improved robustness to out-of-band interference and outstanding linearity. We employ a broadband common-gate (CG) LNTA with dual feedback to improve both gain and noise figure (NF) without breaking the fixed relationship between input impedance, transconductance gain, and load impedance. A LNTA load impedance boosting technique suppresses noise-amplification due to TIA, commonly found in passive mixers. The core circuit (RF and baseband signal path) consumes only 13 mW, and the prototype receiver achieves >22.4-dB conversion gain, dB NF, and \u2265 -1.5 dBm IIP3 from 1.4 to 5.2 GHz. Maximum conversion gain of 24.3 dB and minimum NF of 6.5 dB are achieved at 1.4 and 2 GHz, respectively.

Using the virtual decomposition control (VDC) approach with embedded field programmable gate array (FPGA) logic devices, the proposed solution solves a long-standing problem of lacking control precision fundamentally associated with the modular robot manipulators. As a result, this solution allows modular robot manipulators to possess not only their traditional advantages (such as reconfigurability, flexibility, versatility, and ease of use) but precision control capability as well. A hierarchical master-slave control structure is used, which is supported by a high-speed communication system modified from SpaceWire (IEEE 1355), transferring a limited amount of data between the master and slave nodes at a rate of 1000 Hz. In each module, the FPGA logic implementation uses multiple sampling periods of 163.8 \u03bcs, 1.28 \u03bcs, and 20 ns. A gravity counterbalance spring provides a design option for the purpose of energy saving. Experimental results demonstrate unprecedented control precision, which is attributed to the use of both the VDC approach and embedded FPGA implementation. The ratio of the maximum position tracking error to the maximum velocity reaches 0.00012 s-more than an order of magnitude better than available technologies in control of robots with harmonic drives. The solution presented in this paper is also applicable to integrated robot manipulators using embedded FPGA controllers.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/6615999/06544314.pdf","startPage":"1162","endPage":"1179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precision Control of Modular Robot Manipulators: The VDC Approach With Embedded FPGA","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2013.2265631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6615999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2013.2265631","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Precision Control of Modular Robot Manipulators: The VDC Approach With Embedded FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13811308","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6544314/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision Control of Modular Robot Manipulators: The VDC Approach With Embedded FPGA","sourcePdf":"tro-zhu-2265631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131242S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6615999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6615999","articleId":"6544314","onlineDate":"19 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544315,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo D.

Ripple reduction is accomplished by a correct phase shifting, and the filtering improvement explained by the increase in the ripple frequency. However, these benefits are wasted, among other reasons, by the mismatch of the phase inductor value. As a consequence, differences in the ripple amplitude among phases are produced, leading to a total current ripple significantly greater than the ideal case, the loss of the cancellation points and the generation of the switching frequency component and its harmonics. The works dealing with this subject matter have focused on particular cases, such as a given number of phases, a specific converter topology, or a particular case of inductance mismatch, disregarding a general analytical approach. This paper proposes an analytical method to characterize the total ripple in steady state as a function of the duty cycle and the number of phases under any condition on inductance mismatch.

This robust performance that incorporates the simplicity of ESN implementation has led to wide adoption in the machine-learning community. ESN's simplicity stems from the weights of the recurrent nodes being assigned randomly, known as the reservoir, and weights are only learnt in the output layer using a linear read-out function. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines ESN with support vector machines (SVMs) for time series classification by replacing the linear read-out function in the output layer with SVMs with the radial basis function kernel. The proposed model has been evaluated with an Arabic digits speech recognition task. The well-known Spoken Arabic Digits Dataset, which contains 8800 instances of Arabic digits 0-9 spoken by 88 different speakers (44 males and 44 females) was used to develop and validate the suggested approach. The result of our system can be compared to the state-of-the-art models introduced by Hammami et al. (2011) and P. R. Cavalin et al. (2012) , which are the best reported results found in the literature that used the same dataset. The result shows that ESN and ESNSVMs can both provide superior performance at a 96.91% and 97.45% recognition accuracy, respectively, compared with 95.99% and 94.04% for other models. The result also shows that when using a smaller reservoir size significant differences exist in the performance of ESN and ESNSVMs, as the latter approach achieves higher accuracy by more than 15% in extreme cases.","doi":"10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544391","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6524253/6544378/06544391.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 9th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach combining recurrent neural network and support vector machines for time series classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reservoirs","Support vector machines","Kernel","Mathematical model","Training","Time series analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echo","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","radial basis function networks","recurrent neural nets","signal classification","speech recognition","support vector machines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","support vector machines","time series classification","echo state network","state-of-the-art performance","machine-learning tasks","ESN implementation","machine-learning community","linear read-out function","radial basis function kernel","Arabic digit speech recognition task","spoken Arabic digit dataset","ESNSVM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach combining recurrent neural network and support vector machines for time series classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13583524","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach combining recurrent neural network and support vector machines for time series classification","confLoc":"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569711481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078012S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6524253","isNumber":"6544378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6524253","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6544378","articleId":"6544391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6544399,"authors":[{"name":"Walid A.

In this paper, effects of filtering chaotic signals of CBSC due to finite bandwidth of realistic channel environment and/or detection requirements on the synchronization are investigated. The double scroll chaotic attractor using Chua's circuit is employed at the transmit and receive nodes. Over wide range of filter cut-off frequency (\u03b7), simulation results show that as \u03b7 decreased, below the bandwidth of chaotic signal (W), the synchronization error is increased due to high distortion in the normal geometrical configuration (state-space) of the attractor. Consequently, the system performance will be degraded significantly with high possibility of communication link failure. Thus, careful design should be made to eliminate the impact of filtering and achieve the essential synchronization towards the wide adoption of CBSC in next-generation systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544399","publicationTitle":"2013 9th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6524253/6544378/06544399.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","doi":"10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of filtering chaotic signals on secure wireless communication systems based Chua's circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Impact of filtering chaotic signals on secure wireless communication systems based Chua's circuit","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13583532","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544399/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of filtering chaotic signals on secure wireless communication systems based Chua's circuit","confLoc":"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569712015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073609S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6524253","isNumber":"6544378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6524253","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6544378","articleId":"6544399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6544409,"authors":[{"name":"Uzma Mushtaq","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Uzma","lastName":"Mushtaq","id":"37070393800"},{"name":"Osman Hasan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37601575700"},{"name":"Falah Awwad","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, UAE University, Alain, UAE"],"firstName":"Falah","lastName":"Awwad","id":"37398167300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6203-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6544409","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PNOC: Implementation on Verilog for FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6524253/6544378/06544409.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"2013 9th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544378","doi":"10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544409","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Switches","Hardware design languages","Hardware","Switching circuits","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","digital circuits","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","network-on-chip","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network on chip architecture","performance enhancement","digital circuits","PNoC implementation","FPGA based designs","lightweight circuit-switched architecture","programmable NoC","Verilog hardware description language","Xilinx Virtex-II pro FPGA device","XC2Vp30-7 device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544409","abstract":"Network on Chip (NoC) architectures provide a very efficient means for performance enhancement in digital circuits.

The main objective of the proposed control strategy of each distributed generation (DG) unit is to compensate the reactive power of its local loads and to share the reactive power of the nonlocal loads among itself and other DG units. The proposed control strategy includes an improved droop controller whose parameters are adjusted according to the reactive power of the local loads. A virtual inductive impedance loop is augmented to the voltage controller to enhance the steady state and transient responses of the proposed reactive power management scheme. The small signal analysis of the proposed method is presented to ensure stability of the system for different reactive power values. The presented strategy considerably enhances the voltage profiles of the microgrid buses as compared with the conventional droop methods. The proposed method does not require any communication link and minimizes the reactive power flow in the MV lines, thus reducing the losses of the overall microgrid. The performance of the proposed control scheme is verified by using digital time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2013.6544468","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/6544460/06544468.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2013.6544468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decentralized self-adjusting control strategy for reactive power management in an islanded multi-bus MV microgrid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A decentralized self-adjusting control strategy for reactive power management in an islanded multi-bus MV microgrid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter  2013","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"Winter 2013","accessionNumber":"13583209","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decentralized self-adjusting control strategy for reactive power management in an islanded multi-bus MV microgrid","sourcePdf":"CJECE36N1HamzehMokhtariKarimi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025369S","chronDate":"Winter  2013","isNumber":"6544460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"33","articleId":"6544468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6544472,"authors":[{"name":"Nachiappan Valliappan","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6583513/6544472/6544472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nachiappan Valliappan received his M.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX in 2012.

This paper exploits the potential of large antenna arrays to develop a low-complexity directional modulation technique, Antenna Subset Modulation (ASM), for point-to-point secure wireless communication. The main idea in ASM is to modulate the radiation pattern at the symbol rate by driving only a subset of antennas in the array. This results in a directional radiation pattern that projects a sharply defined constellation in the desired direction and expanded further randomized constellation in other directions. Two techniques for implementing ASM are proposed. The first technique selects an antenna subset randomly for every symbol. While randomly switching antenna subsets does not affect the symbol modulation for a desired receiver along the main direction, it effectively randomizes the amplitude and phase of the received symbol for an eavesdropper along a sidelobe. Using a simplified statistical model, an expression for the average uncoded symbol error rate (SER) is derived as a function of the observation angle. To overcome the problem of large sidelobes in random antenna subset switching, the second technique uses an optimized antenna subset selection procedure based on simulated annealing to achieve superior performance compared with random selection. Numerical comparisons of the SER performance and secrecy capacity of the proposed techniques against those of conventional array transmission are presented to highlight the potential of ASM.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061013.120459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6583513/06544472.pdf","startPage":"3231","endPage":"3245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061013.120459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Subset Modulation for Secure Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Subset Modulation for Secure Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544472/","publicationDate":"August 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13707172","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544472/","volume":"61","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Subset Modulation for Secure Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication","sourcePdf":"3231-tc1308-ncahi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.21586S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6583513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"6583513","articleId":"6544472","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544498,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37070152500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6036-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6034-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1947-3834"}],"articleNumber":"6544498","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544498","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Materials","Resistance","Switches","Computers","Physics","Engineering profession"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive random access memory","nanoscale resistive memories","nonvolatile memory application","RRAM research","resistance switching effect","programming current","sneak path problem","interconnected passive network","3D integration technique"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given. Nanoscale resistive memories (RRAMs) have generated extensive interest recently as a promising candidate for future non-volatile memory applications. In this talk, I will briefly summarize the current status of RRAM research, from the switching mechanism, modeling, material choice, performance metrics, to prototype memory demonstrations. Recently improved understanding of the resistance switching effects has led to improved device performance. However, challenges such as the tradeoff between programming current and retention still need to be overcome. Another major challenge for RRAM is the \u201csneak path\u201d problem in the interconnected passive network, and proper \u201cselect\u201d elements need to be developed to break the parasitic paths. Effective 3D integration techniques also need to be demonstrated. Different approaches to address these problems will be discussed.","doi":"10.1109/WMED.2013.6544498","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices (WMED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices (WMED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523365/6544488/06544498.pdf","startPage":"xviii","endPage":"xviii","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMED.2013.6544498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invited talk: Resistive random access memory (RRAM): Materials and devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Invited talk: Resistive random access memory (RRAM): Materials and devices","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13583507","htmlLink":"/document/6544498/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","conferenceDate":"12-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invited talk: Resistive random access memory (RRAM): Materials and devices","confLoc":"Boise, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"010wmed13invitedtalk2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057102S","chronDate":"12-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523365","isNumber":"6544488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523365","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6544488","articleId":"6544498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544509,"authors":[{"name":"Hazem Aboutaleb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Department of Mathematics, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Hazem","lastName":"Aboutaleb","id":"37070060500"},{"name":"Lyudmyla L.

This procedure suffers from various approximation, truncation, and discretization errors. Besides, the measured or simulated system data are known only on the finite bandwidth, while the Hilbert Transform has to be computed on the infinite domain. To avoid these errors as well as inaccuracy of extrapolation of the transfer function to infinity, a new method is proposed to check and enforce causality by using raw bandlimited data that is extended periodically using a polynomial interpolation and computing the Hilbert Transform of the periodically extended data via accurate FFT.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices (WMED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices (WMED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523365/6544488/06544509.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for causality enforcement of DRAM package models using discrete hilbert transforms","doi":"10.1109/WMED.2013.6544509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMED.2013.6544509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"A new method for causality enforcement of DRAM package models using discrete hilbert transforms","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13583515","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-12 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544509/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for causality enforcement of DRAM package models using discrete hilbert transforms","confLoc":"Boise, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"206NewMethodAboutaleb2672901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05871S","chronDate":"12-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523365","isNumber":"6544488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523365","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6544488","articleId":"6544509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544510,"authors":[{"name":"Dalia Elgamel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Idaho, Moscow, USA"],"firstName":"Dalia","lastName":"Elgamel","id":"37070150800"},{"name":"Lyudmyla Barannyk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Department of Mathematics, University of Idaho, Moscow, USA"],"firstName":"Lyudmyla","lastName":"Barannyk","id":"37070375500"},{"name":"A.

The Hamiltonian method is one of the common methods used for checking/enforcing passivity of these multiport networks. Enforcing the passivity for non-passive models is not trivial because it is built on several approximation steps starting from building the macromodel, which captures the frequency domain response, and ending with a suitable spice model for the DRAM circuits. Several approximation steps take place to achieve that result, and multiple constraints are used to preserve the original design characteristics. In this paper, we compared residue perturbation with and without error control in order to calculate how passivity enforcement affects the original model accuracy.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices (WMED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Microelectronics and Electron Devices (WMED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523365/6544488/06544510.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMED.2013.6544510","doi":"10.1109/WMED.2013.6544510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of passive enforcement techniques for DRAM package models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of passive enforcement techniques for DRAM package models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544510/","conferenceDate":"12-12 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544510/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13583516","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of passive enforcement techniques for DRAM package models","confLoc":"Boise, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"207ComparisonPassiveElgamel2672369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074583S","chronDate":"12-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523365","isNumber":"6544488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523365","xplore-issue":"6544488","articleId":"6544510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544524,"authors":[{"name":"Md Rakib Hassan","affiliation":["Gippsland School of Information Technology, Monash University, Churchill, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6868326/6544524/hassa-78-small.gif","p":["Md Rakib Hassan received the BS degree in Computer Science and Engg. from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology in 2003, and MS in Computer Science and Engg. from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2007.

This buying decision of spectrum buyers can depend on several factors including pricing of the spectrum, reputation of a seller, and duration of the contract and spectrum quality. However, existing pricing models for dynamic spectrum access consider mainly bandwidth which makes them unsuitable for real-world trading. In this paper, we consider these issues related to the pricing of spectrum sale in terms of microeconomic theories. First, we consider reputation of spectrum sellers and update it dynamically by considering a buyer's own trading experience with the sellers and collecting recommendations on sellers from other buyers. Second, trustworthiness of recommenders as well as incentive to encourage recommendations are modeled. Third, contract duration and spectrum quality are incorporated such that a buyer's utility is formulated as a function of buyer's resource requirement, reputation of seller and trustworthiness of recommenders. Fourth, the model is analyzed using dynamic pricing of the market and the solution is obtained using market equilibrium. Results demonstrate the superiority of our model over the existing microeconomic models for dynamic spectrum trading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544524/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","volume":"13","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"14485806","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544524/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reputation and User Requirement Based Price Modeling for Dynamic Spectrum Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reputation and User Requirement Based Price Modeling for Dynamic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"tmc-hassan-78-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117843S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6868326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6868326","articleId":"6544524","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6544544,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6585873/6544544/6544544-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaohui Liang (IEEE S'10) received the B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering and the M.Sc. degree in Computer Software and Theory from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

We first propose an explicit Comparison-based Profile Matching protocol (eCPM) which runs between two parties, an initiator and a responder. The eCPM enables the initiator to obtain the comparison-based matching result about a specified attribute in their profiles, while preventing their attribute values from disclosure. We then propose an implicit Comparison-based Profile Matching protocol (iCPM) which allows the initiator to directly obtain some messages instead of the comparison result from the responder. The messages unrelated to user profile can be divided into multiple categories by the responder. The initiator implicitly chooses the interested category which is unknown to the responder. Two messages in each category are prepared by the responder, and only one message can be obtained by the initiator according to the comparison result on a single attribute. We further generalize the iCPM to an implicit Predicate-based Profile Matching protocol (iPPM) which allows complex comparison criteria spanning multiple attributes. The anonymity analysis shows all these protocols achieve the confidentiality of user profiles. In addition, the eCPM reveals the comparison result to the initiator and provides only conditional anonymity; the iCPM and the iPPM do not reveal the result at all and provide full anonymity. We analyze the communication overhead and the anonymity strength of the protocols. We then present an enhanced version of the eCPM, called eCPM+, by combining the eCPM with a novel prediction-based adaptive pseudonym change strategy. The performance of the eCPM and the eCPM+ are comparatively studied through extensive trace-based simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the eCPM+ achieves significantly higher anonymity strength with slightly larger number of pseudonyms than the eCPM.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6585873/06544544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6585873","startPage":"641","endPage":"655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Anonymous Profile Matching in Mobile Social Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fully Anonymous Profile Matching in Mobile Social Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2013","accessionNumber":"13709974","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544544/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Anonymous Profile Matching in Mobile Social Networks","sourcePdf":"641-jsacsupp1309-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116061S","chronDate":"September  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6585873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6585873","articleId":"6544544","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544548,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6585873/6544548/6544548-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhang received the B.E. in Communication Engineering and the M.E. in Communication and Information System from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2001 and 2005, respectively, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from the Arizona State University, in 2013.

The first step toward effective PMSN is for mobile users to choose whom to interact with. Profile matching refers to two users comparing their personal profiles and is promising for user selection in PMSN. It, however, conflicts with users' growing privacy concerns about disclosing their personal profiles to complete strangers. This paper tackles this open challenge by designing novel fine-grained private matching protocols. Our protocols enable two users to perform profile matching without disclosing any information about their profiles beyond the comparison result. In contrast to existing coarse-grained private matching schemes for PMSN, our protocols allow finer differentiation between PMSN users and can support a wide range of matching metrics at different privacy levels. The performance of our protocols is thoroughly analyzed and evaluated via real smartphone experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Profile Matching for Proximity-Based Mobile Social Networking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513057","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6585873/06544548.pdf","startPage":"656","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6585873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2013","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Profile Matching for Proximity-Based Mobile Social Networking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6544548/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2013","publicationDate":"September 2013","accessionNumber":"13709978","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Profile Matching for Proximity-Based Mobile Social Networking","sourcePdf":"656-jsacsupp1309-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082244S","chronDate":"September  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6585873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6585873","articleId":"6544548","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544549,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6585873/6544549/6544549-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kwang-Cheng Chen (M'89-SM'94-F'07) received the B.S. from the National Taiwan University in 1983, and the M.S. and Ph.D from the University of Maryland, College Park, United States, in 1987 and 1989, all in electrical engineering.

Pub/sub is an asynchronous messaging paradigm, in which content transmissions are guided by the interest. Since selfish behavior is common in reality, nodes often behave selfishly with an aim to maximize their own utilities without considering performance of other nodes. Therefore, how to encourage nodes to collect, store and share network content efficiently is one of the key challenges under this paradigm. In this paper, we propose an incentive-based pub/sub scheme, called ConSub, for OppNets. In ConSub, Tit-For-Tat (TFT) mechanism is employed to deal with selfish behavior. ConSub also implements a content exchange protocol between two interacting node, thus encouraging them to play as businessmen and carry contents to satisfy each other's interest. Specifically, the exchange order is determined by the content utility, which is calculated by contact probability and cooperation level between the current node and its neighbors subscribing to the interest. Extensive realistic trace-driven simulation results show that ConSub is superior to existing schemes in terms of delivered packets and transmission hops with reasonable transmission cost.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6585873/06544552.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6585873","startPage":"669","endPage":"679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ConSub: Incentive-Based Content Subscribing in Selfish Opportunistic Mobile Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ConSub: Incentive-Based Content Subscribing in Selfish Opportunistic Mobile Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2013","accessionNumber":"13709982","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544552/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ConSub: Incentive-Based Content Subscribing in Selfish Opportunistic Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"669-jsacsupp1309-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093714S","chronDate":"September  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6585873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6585873","articleId":"6544552","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544554,"authors":[{"name":"Honorio Mart\u00edn","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, Carlos III University of Madrid, Leganes, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Honorio Mart\u00edn is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Electronics Technology Department, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.

A wide range of devices can be attached to objects to provide them with computing and networking functions, from RFID tags for identification purposes to a variety of wireless sensors. In the case of RFID technologies operating in the UHF band, the EPC Class-1 Generation-2 (EPC-C1G2) is one of the most established working frameworks. The security of this standard is quite low and many researchers have proposed over the last years alternative schemes aimed at correcting its multiple vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, the hardware implementation of such protocols has been long neglected, and it is unclear whether these proposals could fit a low-cost device where very few resources can be devoted to the security functions. In this paper, we address this question by reporting our experiences with the ASIC implementation of two representative EPC-C1G2 authentication protocols. We explore the design space and provide a detailed analysis of the area occupied by the synthesized circuits, their power consumption, and the throughput in terms of protocol runs per second. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ASIC implementation of two lightweight protocols conforming the EPC-C1G2 specification. We believe that some of the discussion and insights here reported could be helpful to future implementations, both for RFID systems and resource-constrained sensors.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2270404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6583958/06544554.pdf","startPage":"3537","endPage":"3547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2270404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient ASIC Implementation and Analysis of Two EPC-C1G2 RFID Authentication Protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544554/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient ASIC Implementation and Analysis of Two EPC-C1G2 RFID Authentication Protocols","volume":"13","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13736141","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544554/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient ASIC Implementation and Analysis of Two EPC-C1G2 RFID Authentication Protocols","sourcePdf":"jsen-perislopez-2270404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09388S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6583958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6583958","articleId":"6544554","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544569,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanqing Li","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6634541/6544569/6544569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanqing Li was born in Hunan Province, China, in 1966.

The four groups of flickering buttons were set in the graphical user interface. Each group contained one large button in the center and eight small buttons around it, all of which flashed at a fixed frequency (e.g., 7.5 Hz) to evoke SSVEP. At the same time, the four large buttons of the four groups were intensified through shape and color changes in a random order to produce P300 potential. During the control state, the user focused on a desired group of buttons (target buttons) to evoke P300 potential and SSVEP, simultaneously. Discrimination between the control and idle states was based on the detection of both P300 and SSVEP on the same group of buttons. As an application, this method was used to produce a \u201cgo/stop\u201d command in real-time wheelchair control. Several experiments were conducted, and data analysis results showed that combining P300 potential and SSVEP significantly improved the performance of the BCI system in terms of detection accuracy and response time.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2270283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6634541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2270283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6634541/06544569.pdf","startPage":"3156","endPage":"3166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid BCI System Combining P300 and SSVEP and Its Application to Wheelchair Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid BCI System Combining P300 and SSVEP and Its Application to Wheelchair Control","volume":"60","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544569/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13817526","pubMedId":"23799679","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544569/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid BCI System Combining P300 and SSVEP and Its Application to Wheelchair Control","sourcePdf":"tbme-li-2270283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132384S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6634541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"6634541","articleId":"6544569","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":6544579,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6583958/6544579/6544579-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Xu (M'02\u2013SM'12) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.

The advantages and the drawbacks of the methods are critically discussed, providing a comprehensive coverage of key aspects of video-based human behavior understanding, available datasets for experimentation and comparisons, and important open research issues.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2270402","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6648684/06544585.pdf","startPage":"1993","endPage":"2008","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2270402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video-Based Human Behavior Understanding: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Video-Based Human Behavior Understanding: A Survey","volume":"23","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13887068","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544585/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video-Based Human Behavior Understanding: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-vinicius-2270402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.270692S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6648684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6648684","articleId":"6544585","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6544586,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser Mohammadiha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6565391/6544586/6544586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nasser Mohammadiha (S'11) received the M.Sc. degree in electronics engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006.

Compared to traditional unsupervised speech enhancement methods, e.g., Wiener filtering, supervised approaches, such as algorithms based on hidden Markov models (HMM), lead to higher-quality enhanced speech signals. However, the main practical difficulty of these approaches is that for each noise type a model is required to be trained a priori. In this paper, we investigate a new class of supervised speech denoising algorithms using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We propose a novel speech enhancement method that is based on a Bayesian formulation of NMF (BNMF). To circumvent the mismatch problem between the training and testing stages, we propose two solutions. First, we use an HMM in combination with BNMF (BNMF-HMM) to derive a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for the speech signal with no information about the underlying noise type. Second, we suggest a scheme to learn the required noise BNMF model online, which is then used to develop an unsupervised speech enhancement system. Extensive experiments are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed methods under different conditions. Moreover, we compare the performance of the developed algorithms with state-of-the-art speech enhancement schemes using various objective measures. Our simulations show that the proposed BNMF-based methods outperform the competing algorithms substantially.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2013.2270369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2270369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/10376/6565391/06544586.pdf","startPage":"2140","endPage":"2151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised and Unsupervised Speech Enhancement Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Supervised and Unsupervised Speech Enhancement Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","volume":"21","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544586/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13686290","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544586/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised and Unsupervised Speech Enhancement Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","sourcePdf":"tasl-mohammadiha-2270369-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117279S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6565391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"6565391","articleId":"6544586","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544589,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Cheng","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37929071700"},{"name":"Cheng Wang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086632435"},{"name":"Jonathan Li","affiliation":["Department of Geography and Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086625648"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6544589","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Training","Image resolution","Optimization","Additive noise","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionaries","geophysical image processing","image fusion","image representation","image resolution","image sampling","learning (artificial intelligence)","singular value decomposition","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["raw-patch-dictionary sampling","IKONOS data","QuickBird data","linear constraint K-SVD method","random sampled patch","additive wavelet fusion method","HRM imaging","high-resolution multispectral imaging","LRM imaging","low-resolution multispectral imaging","HRP","high-resolution panchromatic","trained dictionary","sparse representation","pansharpening"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","K-SVD","multispectral image","panchromatic image","sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"Sparse representation has been used to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (HRP) and low-resolution multispectral (LRM) images.

Also, special care was taken to allow implementation friendliness, including limited bit depth, preservation of symmetry properties, embedded structure and basis vectors having almost equal norm. The transform design has the following properties: 16 bit data representation before and after each transform stage (independent of the internal bit depth), 16 bit multipliers for all internal multiplications, no need for correction of different norms of basis vectors during quantization/de-quantization, all transform sizes above 4 \u00d7 4 can reuse arithmetic operations for smaller transform sizes, and implementations using either pure matrix multiplication or a combination of matrix multiplication and butterfly structures are possible. The transform design is friendly to parallel processing and can be efficiently implemented in software on SIMD processors and in hardware for high throughput processing.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2270429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6657464/06544598.pdf","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6657464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2270429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Core Transform Design in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Core Transform Design in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544598/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13914418","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544598/","volume":"7","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Core Transform Design in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard","sourcePdf":"jstsp-budagavi-2270429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079149S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6657464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6657464","articleId":"6544598","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544599,"authors":[{"name":"Saverio Bolognani","affiliation":["Laboratory on Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6642086/6544599/6544599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saverio Bolognani received the B.S. degree in information engineering, the M.S. degree in automation engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of Padova, Padua, Italy, in 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively.","From 2006 to 2007, he was a visiting graduate student at the University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. in 2011 and 2012, he was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, and since 2013 he has been a Postdoctoral Associate in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.

We first propose an approximate model for the power distribution network, which allows us to cast the problem into the class of convex quadratic, linearly constrained, optimization problems. We then consider the specific problem of commanding the microgenerators connected to a microgrid, in order to achieve the optimal injection of reactive power. For this task, we design a randomized, leader-less, gossip-like optimization algorithm. We show how a distributed approach is possible, where microgenerators need to have only a partial knowledge of the problem parameters and of the state, and can perform only local measurements. For the proposed algorithm, we provide conditions for convergence together with an analytic characterization of the convergence speed. The analysis shows that, in radial networks, the best performance is achieved when we command cooperation among microgenerators that are neighbors in the electric topology. Numerical simulations are included to validate both the proposed model and the analytic results about the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2013.2270317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6642086/06544599.pdf","startPage":"2818","endPage":"2833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6642086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2013.2270317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Control Strategy for Reactive Power Compensation in Smart Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Control Strategy for Reactive Power Compensation in Smart Microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544599/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13858197","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544599/","volume":"58","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Control Strategy for Reactive Power Compensation in Smart Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tac-bolognani-2270317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133578S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6642086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"6642086","articleId":"6544599","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6544600,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Z.

This work addresses the problem of increased degradation in performance when moving from speaker-dependent (SD) to speaker-independent (SI) conditions for connectionist (or hybrid) hidden Markov model/artificial neural network (HMM/ANN) systems in the context of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). Adapting hybrid HMM/ANN systems on a small amount of adaptation data has been proven to be a difficult task, and has been a limiting factor in the widespread deployment of hybrid techniques in operational ASR systems. Addressing the crucial issue of speaker adaptation (SA) for hybrid HMM/ANN system can thereby have a great impact on the connectionist paradigm, which will play a major role in the design of next-generation LVCSR considering the great success reported by deep neural networks - ANNs with many hidden layers that adopts the pre-training technique - on many speech tasks. Current adaptation techniques for ANNs based on injecting an adaptable linear transformation network connected to either the input, or the output layer are not effective especially with a small amount of adaptation data, e.g., a single adaptation utterance. In this paper, a novel solution is proposed to overcome those limits and make it robust to scarce adaptation resources. The key idea is to adapt the hidden activation functions rather than the network weights. The adoption of Hermitian activation functions makes this possible. Experimental results on an LVCSR task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","volume":"21","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13686299","htmlLink":"/document/6544616/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hermitian Polynomial for Speaker Adaptation of Connectionist Speech Recognition Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hermitian Polynomial for Speaker Adaptation of Connectionist Speech Recognition Systems","sourcePdf":"tasl-siniscalchi-2270370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141257S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6565391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6565391","articleId":"6544616","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544635,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Alam","affiliation":["Caterpillar Trimble Control Technologies, Dayton, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6670533/6544635/6544635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nima Alam received the B.E. degree in telecommunication systems and the M.Eng.Sc. degree in control systems from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in vehicular positioning enhancement from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2012.","From 2000 to 2008, he was involved in a variety of industrial projects, including industrial robotics, automated guided vehicles, machine vision, and GPS navigation.

Vehicular positioning is a fundamental part of many ITS applications. Although global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS), are applicable for navigation and fleet management, the accuracy and availability of GNSSs do not meet the requirements for some applications, including collision avoidance or lane-level positioning. Cooperative positioning (CP) based on vehicular communications is an approach to tackle these shortcomings. The applicability of vehicular CP techniques proposed in the literature is questionable due to viability issues, including internode distance estimation, which is an important part of many CP techniques. Conventional CP systems such as differential GPS (DGPS) and other augmentation systems are also effectively incapable of addressing the given ITS applications. In this paper, modern and conventional CP systems are discussed, and the viability of radio ranging/range rating and constraints of vehicular communications as main pieces of modern CP systems are investigated. The general performance boundaries for modern CP systems are explained, as is the gap existing between the positioning accuracy required for crucial ITS applications and what modern CP can provide. This is followed by introduction of a novel trend for vehicular CP research, which is a potential reliable solution using a modified concept of real-time kinematic (RTK) GPSs for vehicular environments.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2013.2266339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6670533/06544635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2013.2266339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670533","startPage":"1708","endPage":"1717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Positioning for Vehicular Networks: Facts and Future","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Positioning for Vehicular Networks: Facts and Future","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13934298","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544635/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Positioning for Vehicular Networks: Facts and Future","sourcePdf":"tits-alam-2266339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120286S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6670533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6670533","articleId":"6544635","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544648,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir A.

In this paper we explore several properties and limitations of the recently proposed method of logarithmic cumulants (MoLC) parameter estimation approach which is an alternative to the classical maximum likelihood (ML) and method of moments (MoM) approaches. We derive the general sufficient condition for a strong consistency of the MoLC estimates which represents an important asymptotic property of any statistical estimator. This result enables the demonstration of the strong consistency of MoLC estimates for a selection of widely used distribution families originating from (but not restricted to) synthetic aperture radar image processing. We then derive the analytical conditions of applicability of MoLC to samples for the distribution families in our selection. Finally, we conduct various synthetic and real data experiments to assess the comparative properties, applicability and small sample performance of MoLC notably for the generalized gamma and K families of distributions. Supervised image classification experiments are considered for medical ultrasound and remote-sensing SAR imagery. The obtained results suggest that MoLC is a feasible and computationally fast yet not universally applicable alternative to MoM.

A typical approach to solving an ILS problem is sphere decoding. To make a sphere decoder faster, the well-known LLL reduction is often used as preprocessing. The Babai point produced by the Babai nearest plane algorithm is a suboptimal solution of the ILS problem. First, we prove that the success probability of the Babai point as a lower bound on the success probability of the ILS estimator is sharper than the lower bound given by Hassibi and Boyd [1]. Then, we show rigorously that applying the LLL reduction algorithm will increase the success probability of the Babai point and give some theoretical and numerical test results. We give examples to show that unlike LLL's column permutation strategy, two often used column permutation strategies SQRD and V-BLAST may decrease the success probability of the Babai point. Finally, we show rigorously that applying the LLL reduction algorithm will also reduce the computational complexity of sphere decoders, which is measured approximately by the number of nodes in the search tree in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2253596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6557006/06544661.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2253596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557006","startPage":"4915","endPage":"4926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of the LLL Reduction on the Success Probability of the Babai Point and on the Complexity of Sphere Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of the LLL Reduction on the Success Probability of the Babai Point and on the Complexity of Sphere Decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13655079","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544661/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of the LLL Reduction on the Success Probability of the Babai Point and on the Complexity of Sphere Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-wen-2253596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12562S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6557006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6557006","articleId":"6544661","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544662,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Ela","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Erik Ela (M\u2033'06) received the B.S.E.E degree from Binghamton University, Vestal, NY, USA, and the M.S. degree in power systems from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA.","He is part of the NREL transmission and grid integration team of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA, where he is involved with different renewable resource integration issues.","Mr. Ela is a member of the Power and Energy Society."]},"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Ela","id":"37541158600"},{"name":"Vahan Gevorgian","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Vahan Gevorgian (M\u2033'97) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the State Engineering University of Armenia.","He is currently with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA.

PFR is the immediate, autonomous response of generation and demand to system frequency deviations. It is the critical response required to avoid triggering under- and over- frequency relays or instability that could lead to machine damage, load-shedding, and in the extreme case, blackouts. Currently, in many restructured power systems throughout the world, ancillary services markets have been developed to incent technologies to provide the services to support power system reliability. However, few ancillary services markets include a market explicitly incentivizing the provision of PFR. Historically, PFR was an inherent feature available in conventional generating technologies, and in most systems, more was available than needed. Yet, recent trends in declining frequency response, the introduction of emerging technologies, and market behavior may soon require innovative market designs to incent resources to provide this valuable service.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2264942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6684613/06544662.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"431","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2264942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Market Designs for the Primary Frequency Response Ancillary Service\u2014Part I: Motivation and Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Market Designs for the Primary Frequency Response Ancillary Service\u2014Part I: Motivation and Design","volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6544662/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13973478","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Market Designs for the Primary Frequency Response Ancillary Service\u2014Part I: Motivation and Design","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ela-2264942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094097S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6684613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6684613","articleId":"6544662","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6544665,"authors":[{"name":"Jeevan K.

It is constructed using a complexity-reduced generalized memory polynomial (MP) (GMP) (CR-GMP) connected with a nonlinear memory effect (NME) subblock in parallel. The CR-GMP is a complexity-reduced but accuracy-degraded version of the conventional GMP, and its performance is augmented by the extra NME subblock. Hence, the proposed model is termed as augmented CR-GMP (ACR-GMP). The resultant ACR-GMP model can achieve comparable performance as the GMP model, but with much fewer coefficients and lower complexity. Its performance is experimentally assessed both in forward modeling and DPD linearization. Comparisons are conducted between the ACR-GMP model and some state-of-the-art models, such as the MP, the PLUME, and the GMP. Experimental results have been given for a 1.9-GHz 35-W peak-power GaN Class-AB PA driven by two signal scenarios: a 15-MHz bandwidth long-term-evolution signal and a 20-MHz bandwidth wideband-code-division-multiple-access 1001 signal (with the middle two carriers OFF). All the results show that the ACR-GMP model outperforms both the MP and the PLUME models in terms of performances and the GMP model in terms of complexity (at comparable performances).","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2270217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6637065/06544668.pdf","startPage":"2389","endPage":"2401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2270217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6637065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Augmented Complexity-Reduced Generalized Memory Polynomial for Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544668/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Augmented Complexity-Reduced Generalized Memory Polynomial for Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"13849453","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544668/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Augmented Complexity-Reduced Generalized Memory Polynomial for Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2270217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068305S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6637065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6637065","articleId":"6544668","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544669,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA","Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"He","id":"37311211700"},{"name":"Ashish Khisti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Khisti","id":"37283481000"},{"name":"Aylin Yener","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Yener","id":"37273211500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6544669","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"A two-transmitter Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel with multiple antennas at each of the nodes is investigated. The channel matrices of the legitimate users are fixed and revealed to all the terminals, whereas the channel matrices of the eavesdropper are arbitrarily varying and only known to the eavesdropper. The secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) region under a strong secrecy constraint is characterized. A transmission scheme that orthogonalizes the transmit signals of the two users at the intended receiver, and uses a single-user wiretap code for each user, is shown to achieve the s.d.o.f. region.

However, they generally deal only with a single fault. Instead, in practice, the case of mixed faults is quite common: the simultaneous presence of broken rotor bars and an intrinsic eccentricity or a coupling misalignment occurs often in an induction machine. The aim of this paper is to analyze theoretically and experimentally the stator current of an induction machine operating with mixed faults: broken rotor bars and static eccentricity (SE). First, an analytical expression for the mutual inductances under SE is derived using a mixture of modified winding function and Fourier series approach. Then, both theoretical and simulation studies are presented to show how the stator current is influenced by the simultaneous presence of (SE) and broken rotor bars with the consideration of the speed ripple effect. It is demonstrated that, in addition to the well-known characteristic frequencies of broken bars, and the rotor slot harmonic (RSH) used for the detection of (SE), this kind of mixed fault introduces in the stator current a series of additional harmonics, in the form of sidebands centered around the fundamental and RSH. More important, it is shown that some of these harmonics are similar to the frequencies introduced by the mixed eccentricity. Finally, experimental results have been presented to validate the analytical and simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","fault diagnosis","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static eccentricity","broken rotor bars","stator current","induction machine","mixed faults operation","mutual inductances","Fourier series approach","rotor slot harmonic","RSH"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broken bars","fault diagnosis","mixed faults (MF)","slot harmonics","speed ripple","static eccentricity (SE)","stator current"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544672","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2270216","startPage":"2452","endPage":"2463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6637065/06544672.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6637065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2270216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","xploreNote":"As originally published the author Abdelmalek Khezzar was mistakenly omitted from the article PDF file.

To close this gap, many 2D-to-3D image and video conversion methods have been proposed. Methods involving human operators have been most successful but also time-consuming and costly. Automatic methods, which typically make use of a deterministic 3D scene model, have not yet achieved the same level of quality for they rely on assumptions that are often violated in practice. In this paper, we propose a new class of methods that are based on the radically different approach of learning the 2D-to-3D conversion from examples. We develop two types of methods. The first is based on learning a point mapping from local image/video attributes, such as color, spatial position, and, in the case of video, motion at each pixel, to scene-depth at that pixel using a regression type idea. The second method is based on globally estimating the entire depth map of a query image directly from a repository of 3D images ( image+depth pairs or stereopairs) using a nearest-neighbor regression type idea. We demonstrate both the efficacy and the computational efficiency of our methods on numerous 2D images and discuss their drawbacks and benefits. Although far from perfect, our results demonstrate that repositories of 3D content can be used for effective 2D-to-3D image conversion. An extension to video is immediate by enforcing temporal continuity of computed depth maps.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2270375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2270375","startPage":"3485","endPage":"3496","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6555827/06544689.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6555827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-Based, Automatic 2D-to-3D Image and Video Conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Learning-Based, Automatic 2D-to-3D Image and Video Conversion","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2013","volume":"22","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544689/","accessionNumber":"13678206","pubMedId":"23799697","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544689/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Based, Automatic 2D-to-3D Image and Video Conversion","sourcePdf":"tip-konrad-2270375-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078194S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6555827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6555827","articleId":"6544689","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6544699,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl S.

Shotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short fragments called reads are extracted from the DNA sequence, and these reads are assembled to reconstruct the original sequence. A basic question is: given a sequencing technology and the statistics of the DNA sequence, what is the minimum number of reads required for reliable reconstruction? This number provides a fundamental limit to the performance of any assembly algorithm. For a simple statistical model of the DNA sequence and the read process, we show that the answer admits a critical phenomenon in the asymptotic limit of long DNA sequences: if the read length is below a threshold, reconstruction is impossible no matter how many reads are observed, and if the read length is above the threshold, having enough reads to cover the DNA sequence is sufficient to reconstruct. The threshold is computed in terms of the Renyi entropy rate of the DNA sequence. We also study the impact of noise in the read process on the performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2270273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6595627/06544699.pdf","startPage":"6273","endPage":"6289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2270273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Theory of DNA Shotgun Sequencing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544699/","displayDocTitle":"Information Theory of DNA Shotgun Sequencing","volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13767488","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544699/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Theory of DNA Shotgun Sequencing","sourcePdf":"tit-motahari-2270273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162665S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6544699","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544700,"authors":[{"name":"Jussi Karttunen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6637065/6544700/6544700-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jussi Karttunen received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland, in 2010 and 2011, respectively, where he is currently working as a Researcher toward the D.Sc. degree.","His research interests include power electronics and electrical drives."]},"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Karttunen","id":"38468212800"},{"name":"Samuli Kallio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6637065/6544700/6544700-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Samuli Kallio received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland, in 2008.

However, the properties of such machines present challenges for current control that make it difficult to produce sufficient performance for the electric drive. This paper introduces an improved vector control scheme for dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous machines. The study includes detailed solutions for key parts of the control such as reference frame transformations, decoupling of the current control loops, and modulation. The performance of the suggested control scheme is evaluated using finite-element analyses and experimental results. The results show that the scheme can produce desired dynamics for the current control and guarantees balanced current sharing between the winding sets. In addition, the proposed solution is capable of reducing current harmonics produced by the internal structure of the machine. This problem is, however, only partly solved since complete elimination of harmonic components is not achieved. Nevertheless, the suggested control scheme overcomes many of the disadvantages found with other control solutions. Improved control performance allows the full benefits of dual three-phase drives to be utilized even in demanding applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2270219","startPage":"2185","endPage":"2196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2270219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6637065","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6637065/06544700.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled Vector Control Scheme for Dual Three-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544700/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decoupled Vector Control Scheme for Dual Three-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6544700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13849468","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled Vector Control Scheme for Dual Three-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-karttunen-2270219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087622S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6637065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6637065","articleId":"6544700","onlineDate":"20 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6544707,"authors":[{"name":"Farnaz Farzan","affiliation":["DNV KEMA, Inc., Chalfont, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Farnaz Farzan is with DNV KEMA Inc., Chalfont, Pennsylvania."]},"firstName":"Farnaz","lastName":"Farzan","id":"37070232300"},{"name":"Sudipta Lahiri","affiliation":["DNV KEMA, Inc., Chalfont, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sudipta Lahiri is with DNV KEMA Inc., Chalfont, Pennsylvania."]},"firstName":"Sudipta","lastName":"Lahiri","id":"37070431500"},{"name":"Michael Kleinberg","affiliation":["DNV KEMA, Inc., Chalfont, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Michael Kleinberg is with DNV KEMA Inc., Chalfont, Pennsylvania."]},"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kleinberg","id":"37069972200"},{"name":"Kaveh Gharieh","affiliation":["Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kaveh Gharieh is with Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey."]},"firstName":"Kaveh","lastName":"Gharieh","id":"37070372900"},{"name":"Farbod Farzan","affiliation":["Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Farbod Farzan is with Rutgers University, New Bruns- wick, New Jersey."]},"firstName":"Farbod","lastName":"Farzan","id":"37974854200"},{"name":"Mohsen Jafari","affiliation":["Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohsen Jafari with Rutgers University, New Bruns-wick, New Jersey."]},"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Jafari","id":"37070322900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1540-7977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4216"}],"articleNumber":"6544707","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1836},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/pes/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Investment","Economics","Commericalization","Load management","Cogeneration","Energy storage","Power markets","Industrial plants","Electricity supply industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","investment","power distribution economics","power distribution reliability","power generation economics","power generation reliability","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software tools","reliability performance","microgrid economics","CHP","combined heat and power","thermal storage","electrical storage","demand-response capabilities","gas-fired generation","PV resources","photovoltaic resources","wind resources","microgrid portfolio","macrogrids","islanding capabiliy","power local production","energy production","installation operation economics","installation investment economics","power 10 MW to 50 MW"]}],"abstract":"A vision shared by many experts is that future communities (residential and commercial developments, university and industrial campuses, military installations, and so on) will be self-sufficient with respect to energy production and will adopt microgrids.

OLTP workloads typically exhibit skewed access patterns where some records are hot (frequently accessed) but many records are cold (infrequently or never accessed). It is more economical to store the coldest records on secondary storage such as flash. As a first step towards managing cold data in databases optimized for main memory we investigate how to efficiently identify hot and cold data. We propose to log record accesses - possibly only a sample to reduce overhead - and perform offline analysis to estimate record access frequencies. We present four estimation algorithms based on exponential smoothing and experimentally evaluate their efficiency and accuracy. We find that exponential smoothing produces very accurate estimates, leading to higher hit rates than the best caching techniques. Our most efficient algorithm is able to analyze a log of 1B accesses in sub-second time on a workstation-class machine.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544811","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530811/6544790/06544811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544790","startPage":"26","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying hot and cold data in main-memory databases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identifying hot and cold data in main-memory databases","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544811/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598352","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544811/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying hot and cold data in main-memory databases","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064545S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6544812,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Leis","affiliation":["Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Leis","id":"38252105400"},{"name":"Alfons Kemper","affiliation":["Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Alfons","lastName":"Kemper","id":"37283127000"},{"name":"Thomas Neumann","affiliation":["Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Neumann","id":"37283126500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4910-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4908-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"6544812","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":1640},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vegetation","Arrays","Subspace constraints","Indexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","database indexing","table lookup","tree data structures","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prefix lookup","range scan","sorted order data","ART performance","internal node","worst-case space consumption","deletion","insertion","read-only search tree","lookup performance","point query","main memory index","hash table","on-CPU cache utilization","balanced binary search tree","in-memory data structure","index structure performance","main-memory database system","RAM","min memory capacity","ARTful indexing","adaptive radix tree"]}],"abstract":"Main memory capacities have grown up to a point where most databases fit into RAM. For main-memory database systems, index structure performance is a critical bottleneck. Traditional in-memory data structures like balanced binary search trees are not efficient on modern hardware, because they do not optimally utilize on-CPU caches. Hash tables, also often used for main-memory indexes, are fast but only support point queries. To overcome these shortcomings, we present ART, an adaptive radix tree (trie) for efficient indexing in main memory. Its lookup performance surpasses highly tuned, read-only search trees, while supporting very efficient insertions and deletions as well. At the same time, ART is very space efficient and solves the problem of excessive worst-case space consumption, which plagues most radix trees, by adaptively choosing compact and efficient data structures for internal nodes. Even though ART's performance is comparable to hash tables, it maintains the data in sorted order, which enables additional operations like range scan and prefix lookup.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544812","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530811/6544790/06544812.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544790","startPage":"38","endPage":"49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The adaptive radix tree: ARTful indexing for main-memory databases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The adaptive radix tree: ARTful indexing for main-memory databases","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544812/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598353","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The adaptive radix tree: ARTful indexing for main-memory databases","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067512S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6544834,"authors":[{"name":"Justin J.

In the last few years, two diverging views have appeared. One approach advocates careful tailoring of the algorithm to the architectural parameters (cache sizes, TLB, and memory bandwidth). The other approach argues that modern hardware is good enough at hiding cache and TLB miss latencies and, consequently, the careful tailoring can be omitted without sacrificing performance. In this paper we demonstrate through experimental analysis of different algorithms and architectures that hardware still matters. Join algorithms that are hardware conscious perform better than hardware-oblivious approaches. The analysis and comparisons in the paper show that many of the claims regarding the behavior of join algorithms that have appeared in literature are due to selection effects (relative table sizes, tuple sizes, the underlying architecture, using sorted data, etc.) and are not supported by experiments run under different parameters settings. Through the analysis, we shed light on how modern hardware affects the implementation of data operators and provide the fastest implementation of radix join to date, reaching close to 200 million tuples per second.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544839","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530811/6544790/06544839.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Main-memory hash joins on multi-core CPUs: Tuning to the underlying hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Main-memory hash joins on multi-core CPUs: Tuning to the underlying hardware","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598380","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544839/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Main-memory hash joins on multi-core CPUs: Tuning to the underlying hardware","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080602S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6544842,"authors":[{"name":"Shirui Pan","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, FEIT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Shirui","lastName":"Pan","id":"37070043000"},{"name":"Xingquan Zhu","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, FEIT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xingquan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37278848400"},{"name":"Chengqi Zhang","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, FEIT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Chengqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274219300"},{"name":"Philip S.

The wide spread of the graph applications and the inherent complex relationships between graph objects have made the labels of the graph data expensive and/or difficult to obtain, especially for applications involving dynamic changing graph records. While labeled graphs are limited, the copious amounts of unlabeled graphs are often easy to obtain with trivial efforts. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a stream based graph classification model by combining both labeled and unlabeled graphs. Our method, called gSLU, employs an ensemble based framework to partition graph streams into a number of graph chunks each containing some labeled and unlabeled graphs. For each individual chunk, we propose a minimum-redundancy subgraph feature selection module to select a set of informative subgraph features to build a classifier. To tackle the concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the subgraph feature selection can emphasize on difficult graph samples. The classifiers built from different graph chunks form an ensemble for graph stream classification. Experiments on real-world graph streams demonstrate clear benefits of using minimum-redundancy subgraph features to build accurate classifiers. By employing instance level weighting, our graph ensemble model can effectively adapt to the concept drifting in the graph stream for classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598383","htmlLink":"/document/6544842/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Graph stream classification using labeled and unlabeled graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph stream classification using labeled and unlabeled graphs","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068488S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544870,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37070409000"},{"name":"Feifei Li","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Li","id":"37067660400"},{"name":"Xiaokui Xiao","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaokui","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37305573600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4910-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4908-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"6544870","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1096},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the secure nearest neighbor (SNN) problem, in which a client issues an encrypted query point E(q) to a cloud service provider and asks for an encrypted data point in E(D) (the encrypted database) that is closest to the query point, without allowing the server to learn the plaintexts of the data or the query (and its result). We show that efficient attacks exist for existing SNN methods [21], [15], even though they were claimed to be secure in standard security models (such as indistinguishability under chosen plaintext or ciphertext attacks). We also establish a relationship between the SNN problem and the order-preserving encryption (OPE) problem from the cryptography field [6], [5], and we show that SNN is at least as hard as OPE. Since it is impossible to construct secure OPE schemes in standard security models [6], [5], our results imply that one cannot expect to find the exact (encrypted) nearest neighbor based on only E(q) and E(D). Given this hardness result, we design new SNN methods by asking the server, given only E(q) and E(D), to return a relevant (encrypted) partition E(G) from E(D) (i.e., G \u2286 D), such that that E(G) is guaranteed to contain the answer for the SNN query. Our methods provide customizable tradeoff between efficiency and communication cost, and they are as secure as the encryption scheme E used to encrypt the query and the database, where E can be any well-established encryption schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530811/6544790/06544870.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"744","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure nearest neighbor revisited","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Encryption","Databases","Standards","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","cloud computing","cryptography","learning (artificial intelligence)","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure nearest neighbor","SNN problem","encrypted query point","cloud service provider","encrypted data point","encrypted database","data plaintext learning","indistinguishability","plaintext attack","ciphertext attack","order-preserving encryption problem","OPE problem","cryptography","standard security model","encrypted nearest neighbor","hardness result","SNN query answer","communication cost","query encryption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Secure nearest neighbor revisited","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544870/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598411","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure nearest neighbor revisited","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098664S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6544874,"authors":[{"name":"Pinghui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Pinghui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406354100"},{"name":"Junzhou Zhao","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Junzhou","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537643000"},{"name":"John C.

Due to the large scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and so sampling is used. In this paper, we show that it is a great challenge even for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, in particular, for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints such as existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, since an unbiased sampling technique such as UVS is usually not allowed, and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present asymptotically unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques respectively. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to two Chinese OSNs, Doudan and Xiami, and discover significant homophily is present in these two networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544874","startPage":"781","endPage":"792","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530811/6544790/06544874.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling node pairs over large graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sampling node pairs over large graphs","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544874/","accessionNumber":"13598415","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544874/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling node pairs over large graphs","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08755S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6544875,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Jun Qi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Guo-Jun","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085376043"},{"name":"Charu C.

In this problem, we wish to predict future links in a growing network with the use of the existing network structure. However, most of the existing methods work well only if a significant number of links are already available in the network for the inference process. In many scenarios, the existing network may be too sparse, and may have too few links to enable meaningful learning mechanisms. This paucity of linkage information can be challenging for the link inference problem. However, in many cases, other (more densely linked) networks may be available which show similar linkage structure in terms of underlying attribute information in the nodes. The linkage information in the existing networks can be used in conjunction with the node attribute information in both networks in order to make meaningful link recommendations. Thus, this paper introduces the use of transfer learning methods for performing cross-network link inference. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544875","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530811/6544790/06544875.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"804","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link prediction across networks by biased cross-network sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Link prediction across networks by biased cross-network sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6544875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598416","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544875/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link prediction across networks by biased cross-network sampling","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059782S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6544909,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshmikant Shrinivas","affiliation":["Vertica Systems- HP Company, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lakshmikant","lastName":"Shrinivas","id":"37070227100"},{"name":"Sreenath Bodagala","affiliation":["Vertica Systems- HP Company, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sreenath","lastName":"Bodagala","id":"37070018700"},{"name":"Ramakrishna Varadarajan","affiliation":["Vertica Systems- HP Company, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ramakrishna","lastName":"Varadarajan","id":"37547324200"},{"name":"Ariel Cary","affiliation":["Vertica Systems- HP Company, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ariel","lastName":"Cary","id":"38194190600"},{"name":"Vivek Bharathan","affiliation":["Vertica Systems- HP Company, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Bharathan","id":"38125409700"},{"name":"Chuck Bear","affiliation":["Vertica Systems- HP Company, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Chuck","lastName":"Bear","id":"37070356500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4910-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4908-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"6544909","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":546},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Query processing","Complexity theory","Engines","Containers","Context","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","database management systems","query processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["materialization strategy","Vertica analytic database","column store database","tuple reconstruction strategy","late materialization","memory","spilling joins","sideways information passing technique","bookkeeping complexity","query processing","data compression","TPC-H query"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544909","abstract":"Column store databases allow for various tuple reconstruction strategies (also called materialization strategies). Early materialization is easy to implement but generally performs worse than late materialization. Late materialization is more complex to implement, and usually performs much better than early materialization, although there are situations where it is worse. We identify these situations, which essentially revolve around joins where neither input fits in memory (also called spilling joins). Sideways information passing techniques provide a viable solution to get the best of both worlds. We demonstrate how early materialization combined with sideways information passing allows us to get the benefits of late materialization, without the bookkeeping complexity or worse performance for spilling joins. It also provides some other benefits to query processing in Vertica due to positive interaction with compression and sort orders of the data. In this paper, we report our experiences with late and early materialization, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and present the details of our sideways information passing implementation. We show experimental results of comparing these materialization strategies, which highlight the significant performance improvements provided by our implementation of sideways information passing (up to 72% on some TPC-H queries).","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544909","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1207","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530811/6544790/06544909.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Materialization strategies in the Vertica analytic database: Lessons learned","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Materialization strategies in the Vertica analytic database: Lessons learned","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6544909/","accessionNumber":"13598450","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544909/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Materialization strategies in the Vertica analytic database: Lessons learned","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092236S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6544916,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Suchanek","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Suchanek","id":"37648219900"},{"name":"Gerhard Weikum","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Weikum","id":"38295935000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4910-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4908-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"6544916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":702},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encyclopedias","Knowledge based systems","Electronic publishing","Internet","Information retrieval","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","knowledge based systems","natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge harvesting","Web sources","text sources","knowledge sharing communities","Wikipedia","scalable information extraction","automatic construction","knowledge bases","DBpedia","KnowItAll","Probase","ReadTheWeb","YAGO","Freebase","semantic classes","mutual relationships","cognitive applications","knowledge centric services","natural-language text","deep question answering","semantic search","enterprise data","Web data","Google knowledge graph","IBM Watson question answering system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544916","abstract":"The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities such as Wikipedia and the progress in scalable information extraction from Web and text sources has enabled the automatic construction of very large knowledge bases.

The trade-off of replica consistency vs. response latency has been widely understood for large-scale stores with replication. The weak consistency guaranteed by existing large-scale stores complicates application development, while the strong consistency hurts application performance. It is desirable that the best consistency be guaranteed for a tolerable response latency, but none of existing large-scale stores supports maximized replica consistency within a given latency constraint. In this demonstration, we showcase RECODS (REplica Consistency-On-Demand Store), a NoSQL store implementation that can finely control the trade-off on an operation basis and thus facilitate application development with on-demand replica consistency. With RECODS, developers can specify the tolerable latency for each read/write operation. Within the specified latency constraint, a response will be returned and the replica consistency be maximized. RECODS implementation is based on Cassandra, an open source NoSQL store, but with a different operation execution process, replication process and in-memory storage hierarchy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6544944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598485","htmlLink":"/document/6544944/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RECODS: Replica consistency-on-demand store","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RECODS: Replica consistency-on-demand store","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049106S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530811","isNumber":"6544790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530811","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6544790","articleId":"6544944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6545064,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Kasal","affiliation":["Department of Radio Electronics Brno, University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Kasal","id":"37550755400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5515-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5512-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5514-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6545064","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"abstract":"This paper is focused on our current research in the field of power amplifier technology for microwaves, especially the X-band. For this purpose we considered different active devices. Unfortunately, we did not manage to obtain super modern GaN transistors (chips) for these frequencies such as TGA2023-05 from TriQuint or module such as TGA-2554-GSG from the same producer. Instead we used internally matched GaAs FETs from Eudyna as well as GaAs module XP-1006A from Mimix. Subsequently we have designed, built and tested three power amplifiers with different active devices and output power of 4, 8 and 20 Watts on 10 GHz. In the paper we would like to introduce design and completion of the amplifiers as well as test results.

We focus on the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, where communication at very low spectral efficiencies takes place. In this regime, a symmetric threshold quantizer is known to reduce channel capacity by a factor of 2/\u03c0, i.e., to cause an asymptotic power loss of approximately 2 dB. Here, it is shown that this power loss can be avoided by using asymmetric threshold quantizers and asymmetric signaling constellations. To avoid this power loss, flash-signaling input distributions are essential. Consequently, 1-bit output quantization of the Gaussian channel reduces spectral efficiency. Threshold quantizers are not only asymptotically optimal: at every fixed SNR, a threshold quantizer maximizes capacity among all 1-bit output quantizers. The picture changes on the Rayleigh-fading channel. In the noncoherent case, a 1-bit output quantizer causes an unavoidable low-SNR asymptotic power loss. In the coherent case, however, this power loss is avoidable provided that we allow the quantizer to depend on the fading level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"At Low SNR, Asymmetric Quantizers are Better","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2262919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6579681/06545291.pdf","startPage":"5421","endPage":"5445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2262919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6579681","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"At Low SNR, Asymmetric Quantizers are Better","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6545291/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13705822","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"At Low SNR, Asymmetric Quantizers are Better","sourcePdf":"tit-koch-2262919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116063S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6579681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6579681","articleId":"6545291","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545298,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Ghamisi","affiliation":["University of Iceland, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iceland"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Ghamisi","id":"37085397924"},{"name":"Micael S.

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous online and offline signcryption scheme to secure communication between a sensor node and an Internet host. We prove that this scheme is indistinguishable against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks under the bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion problem and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the q-strong Diffie-Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages. First, it achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in a logical single step. Second, it allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to an Internet host in a public key infrastructure. Third, it splits the signcryption into two phases: i) offline phase; and ii) online phase. In the offline phase, most heavy computations are done without the knowledge of a message. In the online phase, only light computations are done when a message is available. Our scheme is very suitable to provide security solution for integrating WSN into the IoT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2013","accessionNumber":"13747694","isOpenAccess":true,"displayDocTitle":"Practical Secure Communication for Integrating Wireless Sensor Networks Into the Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Practical Secure Communication for Integrating Wireless Sensor Networks Into the Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jsen-li-2262271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047322S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","isNumber":"6583958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"106","articleId":"6545317","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6545319,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Seup Lee","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong Seup","lastName":"Lee","id":"38184394000"},{"name":"Han Wang","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538472700"},{"name":"Allen Hsu","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Allen","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37531815200"},{"name":"Mohamed Azize","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Azize","id":"37319489200"},{"name":"Oleg Laboutin","affiliation":["IQE KC LLC, Taunton, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Laboutin","id":"37565375000"},{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["IQE KC LLC, Taunton, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085559136"},{"name":"Jerry Wayne Johnson","affiliation":["IQE KC LLC, Taunton, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jerry Wayne","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37274914700"},{"name":"Edward Beam","affiliation":["Triquint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Beam","id":"37328323100"},{"name":"Andrew Ketterson","affiliation":["Triquint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Ketterson","id":"37294255800"},{"name":"Michael L.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model for parts-based data representation to address these difficulties. In our approach, multiple subcategories corresponding to the individual face parts, such as nose, mouth, eye, and so forth, are modeled within a probabilistic graphical model framework to mimic the process of generating a face image. The induced face representation, therefore, encodes rich discriminative information. Model training is totally unsupervised. Once the training is completed, a test sample from the face class can be recognized as a novel combination of learned parts. In summary, the main contributions of this work are threefold: 1) A novel hierarchical probabilistic generative model is proposed, which is capable of achieving an efficient parts-based representation for robust face identification. 2) A constrained variational EM algorithm is developed to learn the model parameters and infer the variables. 3) Two similarity metrics are specially designed for the novel parts-based feature representation, which are effective for matching score guided one sample face identification. The models and similarity metrics are validated on three face databases. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of the model to deal with small sample set, occlusions, and illumination variances.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Training","Data models","Face recognition","Measurement","Lighting","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","probability","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple subcategories parts based representation","one sample face identification","illumination variations","critical obstacles","face identification system","probabilistic generative model","data representation","probabilistic graphical model framework","face image","face representation","discriminative information","constrained variational EM algorithm","face databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face identification","multiple subcategories","one sample","similarity measurement","parts-based decomposition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2013.2263498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6589975/06545327.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6589975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2013.2263498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Subcategories Parts-Based Representation for One Sample Face Identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Subcategories Parts-Based Representation for One Sample Face Identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545327/","volume":"8","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545327/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13747539","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Subcategories Parts-Based Representation for One Sample Face Identification","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhao-2263498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100512S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6589975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6589975","articleId":"6545327","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545336,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Crescentini","affiliation":["DEI, Department of Electrical, Electronics and Information Engineering \u201cGuglielmo Marconi\u201d, Cesena Campus, Via Venezia 52, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6820807/6545336/6545336-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Crescentini (S'11\u2013M'12) was born in Urbino, Italy, in 1984.

This paper will review the basic noise limitations of current sensing interfaces with particular emphasis on integrated CMOS technology. Starting from the basic theory, the paper presents, investigates and compares charge-sensitive amplifier architectures used in both continuous-time and discrete-time approaches, along with their design trade-offs involving noise floor, sensitivity to stray capacitance and bandwidth. The ultimate goal of this review is providing analog designers with helpful design rules and analytical tools.

It was observed by Koike-Akino et al. that adaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the impact of MA interference which occurs at the relay during the MA phase and all these network coding maps should satisfy a requirement called the exclusive law. We show that every network coding map that satisfies the exclusive law is representable by a Latin Square and conversely, that this relationship can be used to get the network coding maps satisfying the exclusive law. The channel fade states for which the minimum distance of the effective constellation at the relay become zero are referred to as the singular fade states. For M- PSK modulation ( M any power of 2), it is shown that there are (M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n/4- M/2+1 )M singular fade states. Also, it is shown that the constraints which the network coding maps should satisfy so that the harmful effects of the singular fade states are removed, can be viewed equivalently as partially filled Latin Squares (PFLS). The problem of finding all the required maps is reduced to finding a small set of maps for M- PSK constellations ( M any power of 2), obtained by the completion of PFLS. Even though the completability of M \u00d7M PFLS using M symbols is an open problem, specific cases where such a completion is always possible are identified and explicit construction procedures are provided. Having obtained the network coding maps, the set of all possible channel realizations (the complex plane) is quantized into a finite number of regions, with a specific network coding map chosen in a particular region. It is shown that the complex plane can be partitioned into two regions: a region in which any network coding map which satisfies the exclusive law gives the same best performance and a region in which the choice of the network coding map affects the performance. The quantization thus obtained analytically, leads to the same as the one obtained using computer search for 4-PSK signal set by Koike-Akino et al. when specialized for Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than the conventional exclusive-OR (XOR) network coding and in some cases outperforms the scheme proposed by Koike-Akino et al.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2268155","startPage":"6683","endPage":"6711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2268155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595627","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6595627/06545339.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Network-Coded Bidirectional Relaying Using Latin Squares for --PSK Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545339/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wireless Network-Coded Bidirectional Relaying Using Latin Squares for <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex> </formula>-PSK Modulation","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6545339/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13767512","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Network-Coded Bidirectional Relaying Using Latin Squares for <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex> </formula>-PSK Modulation","sourcePdf":"tit-rajan-2268155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165724S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6545339","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6545343,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhou","affiliation":["International Research Institute of Stavanger, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291310500"},{"name":"Changyun Wen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Changyun","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280264000"},{"name":"Guanghong Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guanghong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290182400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6545343","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":258,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3133},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","nonlinear control systems","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive backstepping stabilization","nonlinear uncertain system","quantized input signal","strict feedback nonlinear system","hysteretic quantizer","chattering","closed-loop system","signal boundedness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","backstepping","hysteretic quantizer","nonlinear systems","quantized control"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a general class of strict feedback nonlinear systems, where the input signal takes quantized values.

The proposed sensor tag, based on time domain, consists of cascaded group of transmission-line sections (C-sections) coupled at alternative ends capable of producing group delay peaks at a particular frequency. C-sections allow producing a unique ID for a tag. Sensing is achieved by depositing silicon nanowires on the strips of the C-sections group. Silicon nanowires are very sensitive to environmental humidity variation, which in turn changes the radar cross section (RCS), phase, and group delay of the tag. This feature is utilized for humidity sensor applications. The proposed sensor tag is experimentally verified.

The estimated motion intention is integrated into the developed adaptive impedance control, which makes the robot follow a given target impedance model.

Since this results in a significant degradation of the signal to interference and noise ratio at the output of the adaptive filter, we investigate a scheme to jointly detect the contaminated samples and subsequently take this information into account for estimation of the disturbance covariance matrix. Towards this end, a Bayesian model is proposed, parameterized by binary variables indicating the presence/absence of signal-like components in the training samples. These variables, together with the signal amplitudes and the disturbance covariance matrix are jointly estimated using a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach. Two strategies are proposed to implement the MMSE estimator. First, a stochastic Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is presented based on Gibbs sampling. Then a computationally more efficient scheme based on variational Bayesian analysis is proposed. Numerical simulations attest to the improvement achieved by this method compared to conventional methods such as diagonal loading. A successful application to real radar data is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2269048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6568918/06545370.pdf","startPage":"4318","endPage":"4329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2269048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6568918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Processing With Signal Contaminated Training Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545370/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Processing With Signal Contaminated Training Samples","volume":"61","issue":"17","publicationDate":"Sept.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13696785","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545370/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Processing With Signal Contaminated Training Samples","sourcePdf":"tsp-besson-2269048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059235S","chronDate":"Sept.1,  2013","isNumber":"6568918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6545370","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545375,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Schwarz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6578576/6545375/6545375-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Schwarz was born in Neunkirchen, Austria, in 1984.

Due to strict delay limits, vector quantization over multiple time instants cannot be applied to exploit the temporal correlation of the source signal. Instead, a vector predictive quantizer is proposed that combines prediction and differential quantization algorithms to achieve an efficient quantization of the correlated Grassmannian source. The proposed predictor is based on adaptive finite impulse response filters to adjust to the temporal statistics of the source signal. It is shown that the prediction error in the tangent space associated with the Grassmann manifold behaves approximately Gaussian, provided its norm is sufficiently small. The proposed quantization algorithm is applied to channel state information quantization in multi-user beamforming wireless communication systems. Large throughput gains are demonstrated in comparison to memoryless quantization, due to reduced multi-user interference.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2270466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6578576/06545375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2270466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578576","startPage":"4450","endPage":"4462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Quantization on a Grassmann-Manifold for Limited Feedback Beamforming Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Quantization on a Grassmann-Manifold for Limited Feedback Beamforming Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13706403","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6545375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Quantization on a Grassmann-Manifold for Limited Feedback Beamforming Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-schwarz-2270466-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11212S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6578576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6578576","articleId":"6545375","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545377,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Rezaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/6589217/6545377/6545377-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saeed Rezaee received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tehran University, Tehran, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree in power engineering from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran.","His research interests include power electronics converters and modeling, nonlinear control techniques of converters, hybrid energy sources, and electric vehicles."]},"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Rezaee","id":"37282829700"},{"name":"Ebrahim Farjah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/6589217/6545377/6545377-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ebrahim Farjah (M'03) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 1987, the M.Sc. degree in electrical power engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from INPG, Grenoble, France.","He is currently associate professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Shiraz University.

Fleets of such vehicles in large numbers could be regarded as considerable stochastic loads in view of the electrical grid. Moreover, they are not stabled in unique positions to define their impact on the grid. Municipal parking lots could be considered as important aggregators letting these vehicles interact with the utility grid in certain positions. A bidirectional power interface in a parking lot could link electric vehicles with the utility grid or any storage and dispersed generation. Such vehicles, depending on their need, could transact power with parking lots. Considering parking lots equipped with power interfaces, in more general terms, parking-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-parking are propose here instead of conventional grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid concepts. Based on statistical data and adopting general regulations on vehicles (dis)charging, a novel stochastic methodology is presented to estimate total daily impact of vehicles aggregated in parking lots on the grid. Different scenarios of plug-in vehicles' penetration are suggested in this paper and finally, the scenarios are simulated on standard grids that include several parking lots. The results show acceptable penetration level margins in terms of bus voltages and grid power loss.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13769814","htmlLink":"/document/6545377/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis of Plug-In Electric Vehicles Impact on Electrical Grid Through Homes and Parking Lots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Analysis of Plug-In Electric Vehicles Impact on Electrical Grid Through Homes and Parking Lots","sourcePdf":"tste-farjah-2264498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068284S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"6589217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6589217","articleId":"6545377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6545379,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Mei","affiliation":["National ASIC system Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6578576/6545379/6545379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Mei received B.S. degree of electronics engineering from Anhui University in 2007 and M.S. degree of circuit and system from Southeast University in 2010, China.

In order to support high throughput wireless communication, the SDR baseband processors typically employ many parallel computation elements, which may also be used for performing other signal processing applications. This paper explores the feasibility of performing complex media processing on such SDR baseband processors. Specifically, the full HD 1080p state-of-the-art H.264/AVC media decoding has been implemented onto a recent version of the ADRES based SDR baseband processor. Since the processor was originally designed exclusively for wireless baseband applications, algorithm and architecture co-optimizations are required to make the goal feasible. Following algorithm analysis, the computationally dominant tasks of the H.264/AVC, including the motion compensation, the intra prediction, the inverse integer transform, and the deblocking filter, have been selected to be mapped onto the ADRES. The experimental results show that, with limited architectural extensions, the ADRES based baseband processor achieves competitive performance efficiency, even compared with several processors that are specifically optimized for the media decoding application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6545379/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13706398","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"18","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of Full HD Media Decoding on a Software Defined Radio Baseband Processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of Full HD Media Decoding on a Software Defined Radio Baseband Processor","sourcePdf":"tsp-mei-2270465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108908S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6578576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6578576","articleId":"6545379","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6545381,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyang Liu","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6632912/6545381/6545381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhengyang Liu (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2011.

A method is proposed to accurately extract the device package parasitic inductance, which is of vital importance to better predict the high-frequency switching performance of the device. The simulation model is verified by a double-pulse tester, and the results match well both in terms of device switching waveform and switching energy. Based on the simulation model, an investigation of the package influence on the cascode GaN HEMT is presented, and several critical parasitic inductances are identified and verified. Finally, a detailed loss breakdown is made for a buck converter, including a comparison between hard switching and soft switching. The results indicate that the switching loss is a dominant part of the total loss under hard-switching conditions in megahertz high-frequency range and below 8~10 A operation current; therefore, soft switching is preferred to achieve high-frequency and high-efficiency operation of the high-voltage GaN HEMT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Package Parasitic Inductance Extraction and Simulation Model Development for the High-Voltage Cascode GaN HEMT","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2264941","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6632912/06545381.pdf","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2264941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Package Parasitic Inductance Extraction and Simulation Model Development for the High-Voltage Cascode GaN HEMT","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6545381/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13843325","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Package Parasitic Inductance Extraction and Simulation Model Development for the High-Voltage Cascode GaN HEMT","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2264941-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057855S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6545381","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6545382,"authors":[{"name":"Xuehui Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6803904/6545382/zhang-2264063-small.gif","p":["Xuehui Zhang received the B.E.E. and M.E.E. degrees from the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, in 2013.","She has developed several onchip structures and techniques to improve the security, trustworthiness, and reliability of a circuit.

With identical functionality and packaging, it would be extremely difficult to distinguish recycled ICs from unused ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring circuit usage time when used in the field. Recycled ICs detection based on aging in ring oscillators (ROs-based) and antifuse (AF-based) are the two techniques presented in this paper. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis is used to separate process and temperature variations' effects on the sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based sensor, counters and embedded one-time programmable memory are used to record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design. Simulation results using 90-nm technology and silicon results from 90-nm test chips show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in AF-based sensors shows that recycled ICs, even used for a very short period, can be accurately identified.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2264063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6803904/06545382.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2264063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of On-Chip Lightweight Sensors for Effective Detection of Recycled ICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Design of On-Chip Lightweight Sensors for Effective Detection of Recycled ICs","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14252208","htmlLink":"/document/6545382/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"57958CS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of On-Chip Lightweight Sensors for Effective Detection of Recycled ICs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-zhang-2264063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057983S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6803904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6803904","articleId":"6545382","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6545383,"authors":[{"name":"Chenlei Bao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6603319/6545383/6545383-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenlei Bao was born in Zhejiang Province, China, in 1987.

Generally speaking, the current regulator guarantees the quality of the injected grid current, and the active damping suppresses the resonance peak caused by the LCL filter and makes it easier to stabilize the whole system. Based on the proportional-integral (PI) and proportional-resonant (PR) compensator together with capacitor-current-feedback active-damping which are widely used for their effectiveness and simple implementations, this paper proposes a simple step-by-step controller design method for the LCL-type grid-connected inverter. By carefully dealing with the interaction between the current regulator and active damping, the complete satisfactory regions of the controller parameters for meeting the system specifications are obtained, and from which the controller parameters can be easily picked out. Based on these satisfactory regions, it is more convenient and explicit to optimize the system performance. Besides, the insight of tuning the controller parameters from these satisfactory regions is also discussed. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed step-by-step design method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2262378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6603319/06545383.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2262378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Step-by-Step Controller Design for LCL-Type Grid-Connected Inverter with Capacitor\u2013Current-Feedback Active-Damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545383/","displayDocTitle":"Step-by-Step Controller Design for LCL-Type Grid-Connected Inverter with Capacitor\u2013Current-Feedback Active-Damping","volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"13766541","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545383/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Step-by-Step Controller Design for LCL-Type Grid-Connected Inverter with Capacitor\u2013Current-Feedback Active-Damping","sourcePdf":"tpel-bao-2262378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151042S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6603319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"6603319","articleId":"6545383","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6545384,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaud Vena","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Conception et dInt\u00e9gration des Syst\u00e8mes (LCIS), Grenoble Institute of Technology, Valence, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Vena","id":"37547299500"},{"name":"Etienne Perret","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Conception et dInt\u00e9gration des Syst\u00e8mes (LCIS), Grenoble Institute of Technology, Valence, France"],"firstName":"Etienne","lastName":"Perret","id":"37277554200"},{"name":"Smail Tedjni","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Conception et dInt\u00e9gration des Syst\u00e8mes (LCIS), Grenoble Institute of Technology, Valence, France"],"firstName":"Smail","lastName":"Tedjni","id":"37073112400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"6545384","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":129,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1494},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"abstract":"A new chipless RF identification (RFID) tag design is presented in this paper to ease the detection of items in a real environment.

Modeling the dynamic behavior of a large population of responsive loads is especially important to evaluate the effectiveness of various demand response strategies. In this paper, a highly accurate aggregated model is developed for a population of air conditioning loads. The model effectively includes statistical information of the load population, systematically deals with load heterogeneity, and accounts for second-order dynamics necessary to accurately capture the transient dynamics in the collective response. Based on the model, a novel aggregated control strategy is designed for the load population under realistic conditions. The proposed controller is fully responsive and achieves the control objective without sacrificing end-use performance. The proposed aggregated modeling and control strategy is validated through realistic simulations using GridLAB-D. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively manage a large number of air conditioning systems to provide various demand response services, such as frequency regulation and peak load reduction.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2266121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6627990/06545388.pdf","startPage":"4655","endPage":"4664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2266121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6627990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggregated Modeling and Control of Air Conditioning Loads for Demand Response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545388/","displayDocTitle":"Aggregated Modeling and Control of Air Conditioning Loads for Demand Response","volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13849581","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545388/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregated Modeling and Control of Air Conditioning Loads for Demand Response","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhang-2266121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097257S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6627990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"291","xplore-issue":"6627990","articleId":"6545388","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6545395,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel J.

To achieve high SNR's in both low and high illumination, while high sensitivity and high full well capacity are essential but limited by pixel size of around 1.0 \u03bcm, reduction of crosstalk is more efficient way, which makes `effectively' sensitivity and full well capacity higher.

Some of these involve novel processes like wafer thinning and bonding, while others involve novel device or optical structures like light-pipes. The development of 3D interconnect and packaging technologies has also allowed new sensor structures to be developed that allow further customization to imaging. Whether these will be commercially viable, will depend on the cost-effectiveness of developing and manufacturing such structures. Despite the fact that increasingly complicated structures are being used, as we reach pixels with sizes 1.1um and below, system MTF does not continue to scale in performance with the increased pixel sampling frequency. However, the increased pixel sampling frequency can be used to support novel functionality such as High Dynamic Range Imaging or time-interleaved sampling for other applications like depth sensing and stereo vision.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges and opportunities in small pixel development for novel CMOS image sensors","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Application (VLSI-TSA)","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-TSA.2013.6545642","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Application (VLSI-TSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530992/6545273/06545642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-TSA.2013.6545642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Challenges and opportunities in small pixel development for novel CMOS image sensors","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545642/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598548","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges and opportunities in small pixel development for novel CMOS image sensors","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"18TS24aptinavlsitsa2013paper304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036829S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530992","isNumber":"6545273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530992","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6545273","articleId":"6545642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6545643,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

Because only two additions per output sample would be required to implement such a MAF, its computational complexity is rather simple compared to any other direct-form finite impulse response (FIR) filter. To handle its weak side-lobe attenuation, which would cause the spectrally nearby OFDM signal to interfere with the extracted pilot signal, we further propose using multiple MAFs in cascade to enhance the side-lobe attenuation. We evaluate the performance of a 16-QAM and 40-Gbps PDM-CO-OFDM signal, in terms of the bandwidth tolerance, optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) tolerance, nonlinear tolerance, linewidth tolerance, and residual carrier frequency offset (RFO) tolerance, with different filters including the simple MAF, cascaded MAFs, and the previously-demonstrated multi-stage decimation and interpolation filter (MDIF). We've found that 1) all the filters exhibit similar performance to the ideal brick-wall filter in terms of noise and nonlinear tolerances, 2) the MAF1 exhibits the worse tolerances against linewidth and RFO, and 3) the MDIF has to be carefully designed to enhance its tolerances against both the linewidth and RFO.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2270551","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6542668/06545650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2270551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542668","startPage":"2555","endPage":"2564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Carrier Recovery Approach for RF-Pilot-Assisted PDM-CO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple Carrier Recovery Approach for RF-Pilot-Assisted PDM-CO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"15","publicationDate":"Aug.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13595937","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6545650/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Carrier Recovery Approach for RF-Pilot-Assisted PDM-CO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-peng-2270551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118849S","chronDate":"Aug.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6542668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6542668","articleId":"6545650","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6545781,"authors":[{"name":"Mukund Anandan","affiliation":["Centre for Laser Technology, IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Mukund","lastName":"Anandan","id":"37070130500"},{"name":"Saumya Choudhary","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, ISM Dhanbad, Dhanbad, India"],"firstName":"Saumya","lastName":"Choudhary","id":"37070335700"},{"name":"K Pradeep Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Pradeep Kumar","id":"37085938235"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4718-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4718-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6545781","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"abstract":"We propose OFDM to improve key generation rate of frequency-coded QKD system.

Each advance focuses on the virtues of some specific new technique. This paper compares the energy efficiency of both throughput-optimized and latency-sensitive designs, each employing an array of optimization techniques, through a fair \"apples to apples\" methodology. This comparison required us to build many optimized FP units. We accomplished this by creating a highly parameterized FPgenerator, hierarchically encompassing lower-level generators for summation trees, Booth encoders, adders, etc. Having constructed this generator we quickly relearned a number of low-level issues that are critical and are often the most neglected by papers. By exploring cascade and fused multiply-add architectures across a variety of bit widths, summation trees, booth encoders, pipelining techniques, and pipe depths, we found that for most throughput based designs, a Booth-3 fused multiply-add architecture with a Wallace combining tree is optimal. For latency designs, we found that Booth-2 cascade multiply-add architectures are better. As we describe in the paper, Wallace is not always the optimal combining network due to wire delay and track count, and the precise way the CSA's are connected in the tree can make a larger difference than the type of tree used.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545866/6545872/06545888.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2013.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2013.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPU Generator for Design Space Exploration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Generators","Vegetation","Encoding","Logic gates","Optimization","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","logic design","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPU generator","floating point unit","design space exploration","energy efficiency","throughput-optimized design","latency-sensitive design","optimization technique","fair apples-to-apples methodology","summation tree","Booth encoder","adder","Wallace combining tree","Booth-2 cascade multiply-add architecture","Booth-3 fused multiply-add architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["floating point","Fused multiply add","multipliers","power efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPU Generator for Design Space Exploration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545888/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598560","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPU Generator for Design Space Exploration","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4957a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056483S","chronDate":"7-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545866","isNumber":"6545872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545866","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6545872","articleId":"6545888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6545892,"authors":[{"name":"Bilgiday Yuce","affiliation":["Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bilgiday","lastName":"Yuce","id":"38557415900"},{"name":"H.

Numerous systems, which are used in different application areas, require fast (low-latency) circuits to carry out this operation.

AB is based on carrying out all of the required comparisons in parallel and then simultaneously computing the address as well as the value of the maximum element.

But fast recoding methods require pre-computations: multiples of base point or off-line conversion. In this paper, we present a multi-base recoding method for ECC scalar multiplication based on i) a greedy algorithm starting least significant terms first, ii) cheap divisibility tests by multi-base elements and iii) fast exact divisions by multi-base elements. Multi-base terms are obtained on-the-fly using a special recoding unit which operates in parallel to curve-level operations and at very high speed. This ensures that all recoding steps are performed fast enough to schedule the next curve-level operations without interruptions. The proposed method can be fully implemented in hardware without pre-computations.

However, the hybrid nature of these NVM technologies such as phase-change memory (PCM) make it difficult to use them to best advantage in the memory-storage hierarchy. These NVMs lack the fast write latency required of DRAM and are thus not suitable as DRAM equivalent on the memory bus, yet their low latency even in random access patterns is not easily exploited over an I/O bus. In this work, we describe an FPGA-based system to execute application-specific operations in the NVM controller and evaluate its performance on two microbenchmarks and a keyvalue store. Our system Minerva1extends the conventional solidstate drive (SSD) architecture to offload data or I/O intensive application code to the SSD to exploit the low latency and high internal bandwidth of NVMs. Performing computation in the FPGA-based NVM storage controller significantly reduces data traffic between the host and storage and serves as an offload engine for data analysis workloads. A runtime library enables the programmer to offload computations to the SSD without dealing with the complications of the underlying architecture and inter-controller communication management. We have implemented a prototype of Minerva on the BEE3 FPGA system. We compare the performance of Minerva to a state of the art PCIe-attached PCM-based SSD. Minerva improves performance by an order of magnitude on two microbenchmarks. Minerva based key-value store performs up to 5.2 M get operations/s and 4.0 M set operations/s which is 7.45\u00d7 and 9.85\u00d7 higher than the PCM-based SSD that uses the conventional I/O architecture. This huge improvement comes from the reduction of data transfer between the storage to the host and the FPGA-based data processing in the SSD.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06545987.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minerva: Accelerating Data Analysis in Next-Generation SSDs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process control","Kernel","Phase change materials","Nonvolatile memory","Computer architecture","Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","field programmable gate arrays","peripheral interfaces","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data transfer reduction","PCIe-attached PCM","BEE3 FPGA system","intercontroller communication management","runtime library","NVM storage controller","I-O intensive application code","solid-state drive architecture","key-value store","microbenchmarks","application-specific operations","random access patterns","memory-storage hierarchy","phase-change memory","large data sets","storage-like density","DRAM-like latency","nonvolatile memory technologies","next-generation SSD","data analysis acceleration","Minerva"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["storage systems","non-volatile memory","solidstate drive","I/O performance","flash memory","phase-change memory","spin-transfer torque memory","FPGA","Virtex-5","big data applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Minerva: Accelerating Data Analysis in Next-Generation SSDs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596107","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minerva: Accelerating Data Analysis in Next-Generation SSDs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055123S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6545987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545988,"authors":[{"name":"Robert J.

Being \u201cmemory-centric\u201d, the DLM architecture can significantly improve the overall performance and energy efficiency of many memory-intensive embedded applications, especially those that exhibit irregular array data access patterns at algorithmic level. However, implementing DLM architecture poses unique challenges to an FPGA designer in terms of 1) organizing and partitioning diverse on-chip memory resources, and 2) orchestrating effective data transmission between on-chip and off-chip memory. In this paper, we offer our solutions to both of these challenges. Specifically, 1) we propose a stochastic memory partitioning scheme based on the well-known simulated annealing algorithm. It obtains memory partitioning solutions that promote parallelized memory accesses by exploring large solution space; 2) we augment the proposed DLM architecture with a reconfigure hardware graph that can dynamically compute precedence relationship between memory partitions, thus effectively exploiting algorithmic level memory parallelism on a per-application basis. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach (A3) against two other DLM architecture synthesizing methods: an algorithmic-centric reconfigurable computing architectures with a single monolithic memory (A1) and the heterogeneous distributed architectures synthesized according to [1] (A2). To make our comparison fair, in all three architectures, the data path remains the same while local memory architecture differs. For each of ten benchmark applications from SPEC2006 and MiBench [2], we break down the performance benefit of using A3 into two parts: the portion due to stochastic local memory partitioning and the portion due to the dynamic graph-based memory arbitration. All experiments have been conducted with a Virtex-5 (XCV5LX155T-2) FPGA. On average, our experimental results show that our proposed A3 architecture outperforms A2 and A1 by 34% and 250%, respectively. Within the performance improvement of A3 over A2, more than 70% improvement comes from the hardware graph-based memory scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.39","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06545989.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Boosting Memory Performance of Many-Core FPGA Device through Dynamic Precedence Graph","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596109","htmlLink":"/document/6545989/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting Memory Performance of Many-Core FPGA Device through Dynamic Precedence Graph","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04157S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6545989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545990,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Dennl","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Dennl","id":"38246653300"},{"name":"Daniel Ziener","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ziener","id":"37300389000"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Teich","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4969-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6005-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6545990","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":556},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Software","Acceleration","Remuneration","Benchmark testing","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","query processing","relational databases","SQL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SQL restriction acceleration","SQL aggregation acceleration","FPGA-based dynamic partial reconfiguration","SQL query processing","database systems","operator coverage","full dynamic data path generation","complex operators","computation time analysis","database queries","relational database management systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SQL processing","Partial Reconfiguration","Aggregation"]}],"abstract":"SQL query processing on large database systems is recognized as one of the most important emerging disciplines of computing nowadays.

While high degrees of parallelism within custom FPGA-based accelerators may help to some extent, it may also be necessary to limit the precision used in the datapath to boost the operating frequency of the implementation. However, by reducing the precision, the engineer introduces quantization error into the design. In this paper, we demonstrate that for many applications it would be preferable to simply overclock the design and accept that timing violations may arise. Since the errors introduced by timing violations occur rarely, they will cause less noise than quantization errors. Through the use of analytical models and empirical results on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA, we show that a geometric mean reduction of 67.9% to 98.8% in error expectation or a geometric mean improvement of 3.1% to 27.6% in operating frequency can be obtained using this alternative design methodology.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06545991.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy-Performance Tradeoffs on an FPGA through Overclocking","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.10","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy-Performance Tradeoffs on an FPGA through Overclocking","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596111","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6545991/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy-Performance Tradeoffs on an FPGA through Overclocking","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090234S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6545991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6545993,"authors":[{"name":"Eddie Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Eddie","lastName":"Hung","id":"37679137500"},{"name":"Fatemeh Eslami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37888404400"},{"name":"Steven J.E.

Currently, we can faithfully translate VPR's heterogeneous packing and placement results into an exact Xilinx `map' netlist, which is then routed by its `par' tool. We showcase the utility of this new method with two compelling applications targeting a 40nm Virtex-6 device: a fair comparison of the area, delay, and CAD runtime of academia's state-of-the-art VTR How with a commercial, closed-source equivalent, along with a CAD experiment evaluated using physical measurements of on-chip power consumption and die temperature, over time. This extended How - VTR-to-Bitstream - is released to the community with the hope that it can enhance existing research projects as well as unlock new ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Escaping the Academic Sandbox: Realizing VPR Circuits on Xilinx Devices","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.40","startPage":"45","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06545993.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Escaping the Academic Sandbox: Realizing VPR Circuits on Xilinx Devices","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545993/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596113","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Escaping the Academic Sandbox: Realizing VPR Circuits on Xilinx Devices","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054852S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6545993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545995,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulazim Amouri","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Abdulazim","lastName":"Amouri","id":"38494542800"},{"name":"Hussam Amrouch","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Hussam","lastName":"Amrouch","id":"37845811200"},{"name":"Thomas Ebi","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ebi","id":"37542771700"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"},{"name":"Mehdi Tahoori","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Tahoori","id":"37273925100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4969-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6005-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6545995","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Cameras","Mathematical model","Estimation","Integrated circuit modeling","Temperature measurement","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","infrared imaging","temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal profile estimation","FPGA-mapped circuits","in-field operation","dynamic power values","leakage power values","field programmable gate arrays vendor tools","temperature-leakage loop estimation model","infrared thermal camera","Virtex-5 chip","camera measurements"]}],"abstract":"Accurate thermal profile estimation for FPGA, at design time, is necessary to avoid unexpected thermal hot-spots in the circuit before deploying the FPGA to the in-field operation. Both accurate dynamic and leakage power values are needed for the thermal profile estimation and they can be estimated using the FPGA vendor's tools. However these report leakage power as a single value for the whole chip, and no details are given in literature or the FPGA toolset about its distribution across the FPGA chip for the thermal simulation. To cope with this problem, we present a method for properly distributing the leakage power across the FPGA chip. The method uses a temperature-leakage loop estimation model for distributing and adapting the leakage power for more accurate thermal simulation. Furthermore, to accurately calibrate the presented method and its model and also to validate the resulting thermal profiles, we utilize an infrared thermal camera, which measures the emissions from the backside of a Virtex-5 FPGA chip. The results of testing several designs, with different sizes and frequencies, show that our approach can achieve accurate thermal-profile estimation when compared to the camera measurements, with average absolute estimation error of around 1\u00b0C across the chip.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Thermal-Profile Estimation and Validation for FPGA-Mapped Circuits","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.48","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06545995.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Thermal-Profile Estimation and Validation for FPGA-Mapped Circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6545995/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596115","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Thermal-Profile Estimation and Validation for FPGA-Mapped Circuits","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045698S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6545995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6545996,"authors":[{"name":"Aurelio Morales-Villanueva","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Aurelio","lastName":"Morales-Villanueva","id":"37070318100"},{"name":"Ann Gordon-Ross","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ann","lastName":"Gordon-Ross","id":"38272665600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4969-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6005-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6545996","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6545996","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Field programmable gate arrays","Flip-flops","Hardware","System-on-chip","Merging","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip context save and restore","hardware tasks","partial reconfigurable FPGA","field-programmable gate arrays","PR regions","time multiplexing","task execution state","CSR execution time","PRR size","application requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","partial reconfiguration","context save and restore"]}],"abstract":"Partial reconfiguration (PR) of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) enables hardware tasks to time multiplex PR regions (PRRs) by isolating reconfiguration to only the reconfigured PRR, which avoids halting the entire FPGA's execution. Time multiplexing PRRs requires support for unloading/loading tasks and for resuming a task's execution state. In order to resume a task's execution state, the execution state (context) must be saved when the task is unloaded so that the execution state can be restored when the task resumes- context save (CS) and context restore (CR), respectively. In this paper, we present a software-based, on-chip context save and restore (CSR) for PR-capable FPGAs. As compared to prior work, our CSR is autonomous (i.e., does not require any external host support), does not require custom on-chip hardware, is portable across any system design, and does not require tool flow modifications or special tools. Experimental results extensively evaluate the CSR execution time based on PRR size, enabling designers to trade off PRR granularity for CSR execution time based on application requirements.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06545996.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.13","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip Context Save and Restore of Hardware Tasks on Partially Reconfigurable FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On-chip Context Save and Restore of Hardware Tasks on Partially Reconfigurable FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6545996/","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6545996/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596116","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip Context Save and Restore of Hardware Tasks on Partially Reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06306S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6545996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6545999,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Sun","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Sun","id":"38236450800"},{"name":"Jiang Jiang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37597770200"},{"name":"Yongxin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37310652700"},{"name":"Yuzhuo Fu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhuo","lastName":"Fu","id":"37414382100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4969-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6005-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6545999","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Filter banks","Finite impulse response filters","Reconfigurable architectures","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","mathematics computing","reconfigurable architectures","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","VLSI architectures","throughput requirements","bandwidth requirements","fragment-based sample consumption","polyphase structure","MLBF","MAC loop based filter","filter banks","DWT","2D discrete wavelet transform","1D discrete wavelet transform","reconfigurable architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reconfigurable","FPGA implementation","pipeline architecture","high flexibility"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for DWT that can be reconfigured to be adapted to different kinds of filter banks and different sizes of inputs.

Moreover, we show that hardware quality is also affected by the order in which optimizations are applied. We then present a new HLS-directed approach to compiler optimizations, wherein we execute partial HLS and profiling at intermittent points in the optimization process and use the results to judiciously undo the impact of optimization passes predicted to be damaging to the generated hardware quality.

However, standard Ethernet components require specific modifications and hardware support to provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications. This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics.

To explore the suitability of FPGAs for these computations, we are constructing an FPGAbased system with a memory capacity of 512 GB from a collection of 32 Virtex-5 FPGAs spread across 8 enclosures. This paper describes our work in exploring alternative interconnect technologies and network topologies for FPGA-based clusters. The diverse interconnects combine inter-enclosure high-speed serial links and wide, single-ended intra-enclosure on-board traces with network topologies that balance network diameter, network throughput, and FPGA resource usage. We discuss the architecture of high-radix routers in FPGAs that optimize for the asymmetry between the interand intra-enclosure links. We analyze the various interconnects that aim to efficiently utilize the prototype's total switching capacity of 2.43 Tb/s. The networks we present have aggregate throughputs up to 51.4 GB/s for random traffic, diameters as low as 845 nanoseconds, and consume less than 12% of the FPGAs' logic resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06546007.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"136","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latency-Optimized Networks for Clustering FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Topology","Network topology","Switches","Transceivers","Routing protocols","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","network routing","pattern clustering","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["latency-optimized networks","data-intensive applications","semi-structured data sets","unstructured data sets","XML","FPGA-based clusters","Virtex-5 field programmable gate array","network topologies","interconnect technologies","inter-enclosure high-speed serial links","network diameter","network throughput","resource usage","high-radix routers","intra-enclosure links","logic resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","high-radix router","low latency network","high-speed serial","data-intensive applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Latency-Optimized Networks for Clustering FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596126","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latency-Optimized Networks for Clustering FPGAs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091723S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6546007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6546008,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Buscemi","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Technologies Lab, SPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic, Charleston, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Buscemi","id":"38493902300"},{"name":"Will Kritikos","affiliation":["Reconfigurable Computing Systems Lab, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Will","lastName":"Kritikos","id":"37662137000"},{"name":"Ron Sass","affiliation":["Reconfigurable Computing Systems Lab, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Sass","id":"37420915800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4969-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6005-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546008","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Wireless communication","Hardware","Clocks","Ad hoc networks","Transceivers","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based digital wireless channel emulator","RF environment","wireless devices","current designs","network capacity","DWCE systems","hub-and-spoke configuration","distributed system","documented system","multiple-FPGA cluster configurations","computational hardware","low-level VHDL signal path component","low-level VHDL SPC","Xilinx tool-chain","maximum FPGA system clock speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Channel Emulator","FPGA Compute Cluster","Wireless Communications"]}],"abstract":"A Digital Wireless Channel Emulator (DWCE) is a system that is capable of emulating the RF environment for a group of wireless devices. A major issue with current designs is that they do not scale to a large enough number of nodes to emulate meaningful network. A reason for this lack of scalability is the large amount of computations and network capacity required for such a system. Previously documented DWCE systems implement a hub-and-spoke configuration that inhibits them from simply adding additional hardware to scale. This paper investigates the use of a FPGA cluster configured as a distributed system to provide the computational and network structure to scale a DWCE to support 1250 wireless devices. This scale is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than any other previously documented system. This paper presents multiple FPGA cluster configurations that use currently available hardware and describes the algorithms used to route the signals through the network and place the computational hardware on each FPGA. The low level VHDL Signal Path Component (SPC) is synthesized and mapped under different parameters to interpolate is resource utilization. One example FPGA build with enough SPCs to fill 80% of the FPGA resources is successfully run through the Xilinx tool-chain to determine the maximum FPGA system clock speed. Finally, the scaling results are presented that detail the maximum sample frequency of various sized DWCE systems which could be used to examine a variety of wireless devices.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.42","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06546008.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Range and Scaling Study of an FPGA-Based Digital Wireless Channel Emulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546008/","displayDocTitle":"A Range and Scaling Study of an FPGA-Based Digital Wireless Channel Emulator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596127","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546008/","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Range and Scaling Study of an FPGA-Based Digital Wireless Channel Emulator","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064743S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6546008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6546010,"authors":[{"name":"Yingjie Cao","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yingjie","lastName":"Cao","id":"38238460700"},{"name":"Yongxin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37310652700"},{"name":"Xu Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601015000"},{"name":"Jiang Jiang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37597770200"},{"name":"Meikang Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computing Engineering, University of Kentucky, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Meikang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37288778000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4969-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6005-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546010","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":579},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Bridges","IP networks","Software","Bandwidth","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","graphics processing units","logic circuits","peripheral interfaces","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA","generic controlling processors","graphic card","ethernet card","PCIE device","device driver","software driver","IP cores","FPGA board","desktop computer","coprocessing device","PCIE endpoint","PCIE master device","system-on-a-programmable-chip","PCI-Express","field programmable gate array","FPGA based PCI-E root complex architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PCI-E Root Complex","FPGA","SOPC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546010","abstract":"We present an FPGA (field programmable gate array) based PCI-E (PCI-Express) root complex architecture for SOPCs (System-on-a-Programmable-Chip) in this paper.

While GPUs may offer higher throughput for individual kernels, overall application performance is limited by the inability to support on-chip sharing of data across kernels. In this paper, we show that higher on-chip memory capacity and superior on-chip communication bandwidth enables FPGAs to better support the composition of a sequence of kernels within these iterative solvers. We present a time-multiplexed FPGA architecture which exploits the on-chip capacity to store dependencies between kernels and high communication bandwidth to move data. We propose a resource-constrained framework to select the optimal value of an algorithmic parameter which provides the tradeoff between communication and computation cost for a particular FPGA. Using the Lanczos Method as a case study, we show how to minimize communication on FPGAs by this tight algorithm-architecture interaction and get superior performance over GPU despite of its ~5x larger off-chip memory bandwidth and ~2x greater peak singleprecision floating-point performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application Composition and Communication Optimization in Iterative Solvers Using FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.16","startPage":"153","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06546011.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Application Composition and Communication Optimization in Iterative Solvers Using FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546011/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596130","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application Composition and Communication Optimization in Iterative Solvers Using FPGAs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075612S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6546011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6546014,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Modern force fields, such as the AMOEBA, which include explicit polarization effects, are particularly computationally demanding. We propose a static dataflow architecture for accelerating polarizable force fields. Results, obtained with Maxeler's MaxCompiler, show a speed-up factor of about 14x on a Maxeler 1U MaxNode, when compared to a 12-core CPU node while using half of the dataflow engine capacity. Projections for a full chip implementation indicate that speed-up results of up to 29x per node can be reached. Moreover, our implementation on the Maxeler system shows improvements between 2.5x and 4x compared to NVIDIA Fermibased GPUs.

Specifically, a commonly used CPU-friendly GCM algorithm is converted into a fully-pipelined dataflow graph through four steps of optimization: recomposing the algorithm to be pipeline-friendly, removing unnecessary computation, sharing common computing results, and reducing the computing precision while maintaining the same level of accuracy for the computation results. The performance of the proposed DFE design is compared with three CPU-based implementations that are well-optimized. Experimental results show that our DFE solution not only generates fairly accurate result, but also achieves a maximum of 467x speedup over a single-thread CPU-based solution, 120x speedup over a multi-thread CPUbased solution, and 47x speedup over an MPI-based solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based Data Flow Engine for Gaussian Copula Model","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2013.14","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545868/6545974/06546022.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2013.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based Data Flow Engine for Gaussian Copula Model","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546022/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13596141","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based Data Flow Engine for Gaussian Copula Model","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4969a218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082013S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545868","isNumber":"6545974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545868","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6545974","articleId":"6546022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6546023,"authors":[{"name":"Miaoqing Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas, USA"],"firstName":"Miaoqing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37554049400"},{"name":"Shiming Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas, USA"],"firstName":"Shiming","lastName":"Li","id":"37070358000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4969-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6005-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546023","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Computer science","Computers","Educational institutions","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physically unclonable function","delay-based PUF design","multiplexer","FPGA","field programmable gate array","hardware-oriented security","authentication purpose","multiplexers","switching latency","downstream multiplexer","flip-flop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["physically unclonable function","delay-based PUF","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given.

In this paper, a delay-based PUF design involving multiplexers on FPGA is presented.

However, previous binding techniques are all based on encryption and hence have three main drawbacks: 1) encryption-based proposals in commercial are limited to protect the single large FPGA configuration, 2) many encryption-based proposals depend on a trusted third party to involve the licensing protocol, and 3) the encryption-based binding methods use costly mechanisms such as secure ROM or flash memory to store FPGA specific cryptographic keys, which is not only expensive but also vulnerable to side-channel attacks, and the management and transport of secret keys became a practical issue.

However, its ad hoc management of quality-of-service and SLA poses significant challenges to the performance, dependability and costs of online cloud services. The paper precisely addresses this issue and makes a threefold contribution. First, it introduces a new cloud model, the SLAaaS (SLA aware Service) model. SLAaaS enables a systematic integration of QoS levels and SLA into the cloud. It is orthogonal to other cloud models such as SaaS or PaaS, and may apply to any of them. Second, the paper introduces CSLA, a novel language to describe QoS-oriented SLA associated with cloud services. Third, the paper presents a control theoretic approach to provide performance, dependability and cost guarantees for online cloud services, with time-varying workloads. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and extensive experiments with online services hosted in clouds such as Amazon EC2. The case studies illustrate SLA guarantees for various services such as a MapReduce service, a cluster-based multi-tier e-commerce service, and a low-level locking

resources up or down to achieve cost-effective outcomes. True elasticity and cost-effectiveness in the pay-per-use cloud business model, however, have not yet been achieved. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cloud resource auto-scaling scheme at the virtual machine (VM) level for web application providers. The scheme automatically predicts the number of web requests and discovers an optimal cloud resource demand with cost-latency trade-off. Based on this demand, the scheme makes a resource scaling decision that is up or down or NOP (no operation) in each time-unit re-allocation. We have implemented the scheme on the Amazon cloud platform and evaluated it using three real-world web log datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves resource auto-scaling with an optimal cost-latency trade-off, as well as low SLA violations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.73","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546059.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"65","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Cloud Resource Auto-Scaling for Web Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Cloud Resource Auto-Scaling for Web Applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6546059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598592","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546059/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Cloud Resource Auto-Scaling for Web Applications","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083662S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6546061,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbin Fang","affiliation":["Technische Universiteit Delft, Delft, Zuid-Holland, NL"],"firstName":"Jianbin","lastName":"Fang","id":"37893317800"},{"name":"Ana Lucia Varbanescu","affiliation":["Technische Universiteit Delft, Delft, Zuid-Holland, NL"],"firstName":"Ana Lucia","lastName":"Varbanescu","id":"37698034900"},{"name":"Henk Sips","affiliation":["Technische Universiteit Delft, Delft, Zuid-Holland, NL"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Sips","id":"37319521200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6465-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546061","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"abstract":"With the integration of more computational cores and deeper memory hierarchies on modern processors, the performance gap between naively parallel zed code and optimized code becomes much larger than ever before. Very often, bridging the gap involves architecture-specific optimizations. These optimizations are difficult to implement by application programmers, who typically focus on the basic functionality of their code. Therefore, in this thesis, I focus on answering the following research question: \"How can we address architecture-specific optimizations in a programmer-friendly way?'' As an answer, I propose an optimizing framework for parallel applications running on many-core processors (\\textit{Sesame}). Taking a simple parallel zed code provided by the application programmers as input, Sesame chooses and applies the most suitable architecture-specific optimizations, aiming to improve the overall application performance in a user-transparent way. In this short paper, I present the motivation for designing and implementing Sesame, its structure and its modules. Furthermore, I describe the current status of Sesame, discussing our promising results in source-to-source vectorization, automated usage of local memory, and auto-tuning for implementation-specific parameters. Finally, I discuss my work-in-progress and sketch my ideas for finalizing Sesame's development and testing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Programming","Graphics processing units","Kernel","Computational modeling","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Sesame","user-transparent optimizing framework","many-core processor","computational cores","memory hierarchy","parallel zed code","optimized code","architecture-specific optimizations","parallel applications","source-to-source vectorization","local memory automated usage","implementation-specific parameter auto tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization","Many-Core Processors","OpenCL"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546061","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.79","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.79","startPage":"70","endPage":"73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sesame: A User-Transparent Optimizing Framework for Many-Core Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sesame: A User-Transparent Optimizing Framework for Many-Core Processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546061/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546061/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598594","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sesame: A User-Transparent Optimizing Framework for Many-Core Processors","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091825S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6546071,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuya Hoshino","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical and Computing Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Hoshino","id":"37070158400"},{"name":"Naoya Maruyama","affiliation":["RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science, CREST, JST, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoya","lastName":"Maruyama","id":"37318518100"},{"name":"Satoshi Matsuoka","affiliation":["Global Scientific Information and Computing Center, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Matsuoka","id":"37270081500"},{"name":"Ryoji Takaki","affiliation":["Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoji","lastName":"Takaki","id":"37070234200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6465-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546071","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Kernel","Optimization","Arrays","Programming","Instruction sets","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","benchmark testing","computational fluid dynamics","graphics processing units","message passing","parallel architectures","shared memory systems","software maintenance","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CUDA","kernel benchmark","memory-bound CFD","accelerator programming interface","OpenMP-like loop directive","porting process","legacy CPU-based application","performance aspect","computational fluid dynamics","OpenACC specification","GPU hardware resource","shared memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","OpenACC","CUDA"]}],"abstract":"OpenACC is a new accelerator programming interface that provides a set of OpenMP-like loop directives for the programming of accelerators in an implicit and portable way.

This paper focuses on the performance aspects of OpenACC using two micro benchmarks and one real-world computational fluid dynamics application. Both evaluations show that in general OpenACC performance is approximately 50\\% lower than CUDA. However, for some applications it can reach up to 98\\% with careful manual optimizations. The results also indicate several limitations of the OpenACC specification that hamper full use of the GPU hardware resources, resulting in a significant performance gap when compared to a fully tuned CUDA code. The lack of a programming interface for the shared memory in particular results in as much as three times lower performance.","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.12","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546071.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CUDA vs OpenACC: Performance Case Studies with Kernel Benchmarks and a Memory-Bound CFD Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546071/","displayDocTitle":"CUDA vs OpenACC: Performance Case Studies with Kernel Benchmarks and a Memory-Bound CFD Application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598604","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546071/","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CUDA vs OpenACC: Performance Case Studies with Kernel Benchmarks and a Memory-Bound CFD Application","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072618S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6546077,"authors":[{"name":"Seokho Son","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokho","lastName":"Son","id":"37576839700"},{"name":"Sung Chan Jun","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Chan","lastName":"Jun","id":"37544437800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6465-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546077","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":695},"abstract":"As various consumers tend to use personalized Cloud services, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) emerge as a key aspect in Cloud and Utility computing. The objectives of this doctoral research are 1) to support a flexible establishment of SLAs that enhances the utility of SLAs for both providers and consumers, and 2) to manage Cloud resources to prevent SLA violations. Because consumers and providers may be independent bodies, some mechanisms are necessary to resolve different preferences when they establish a SLA. Thus, we designed a Cloud SLA negotiation mechanism for interactive and flexible SLA establishment. The novelty of this SLA negotiation mechanism is that it can support advanced multi-issue negotiation that includes time slot and price negotiations. In addition, to prevent SLA violations, we provided a SLA-driven resource allocation scheme that selects a proper data center among globally distributed centers operated by a provider. Empirical results showed that the proposed SLA negotiation mechanism supports faster agreements and achieves higher utilities. Also, the proposed SLA-driven resource allocation scheme performs better in terms of SLA violations and the provider's profits.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546077.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"171","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negotiation-Based Flexible SLA Establishment with SLA-driven Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Time factors","Cloud computing","Quality of service","Distributed databases","Proposals","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negotiation-based flexible SLA establishment","SLA-driven resource allocation","cloud computing","service level agreements","personalized cloud services","utility computing","cloud resources","cloud SLA negotiation","SLA negotiation mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","SLA Negotiation","Cost Models of Cloud","Cloud Resource Allocation","Distributed Data Centers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Negotiation-Based Flexible SLA Establishment with SLA-driven Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598610","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negotiation-Based Flexible SLA Establishment with SLA-driven Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054114S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6546094,"authors":[{"name":"Juan J.

We study the potential benefits of using a Pareto-based workflow scheduling algorithm called MOHEFT using realistic energy consumption and performance models for task executions. We analyse the tradeoff solutions computed by MOHET for different workflows (different in shapes and sizes) in different execution scenarios (different resources in terms of energy consumption).

Workflow applications common in science and engineering can take great advantage of such ample resource capacity. Yet, existing workflow scheduling algorithms have been mostly designed on the traditional and contrasting premise of scarce resource capacity relative to what applications require. In this paper, we address the problem of workflow scheduling exploiting resource abundance not only for performance, but also for resource efficiency. We first present the critical-path-first scheduling algorithm, which efficiently stretches out the schedule to proactively preserve critical path length, the shortest possible time of completion. We then develop an algorithm to compact the schedule for resource efficiency. The schedule is compacted by rearranging tasks making use of idle/inefficiency slots present in the schedule due to precedence constraints (synchronization). We have compared the performance of our scheduling algorithm with three previous algorithms and evaluated the efficacy of our schedule compaction algorithm by applying it to those four scheduling algorithms including our own. Experiments were conducted in a simulated environment with various real-world scientific workflows. Results show that our scheduling algorithm achieves a great performance to resource usage ratio. Further, our schedule compaction algorithm reduces resource usage by 33% on average ranging from 11.3% to 90.7% with no make span increases.","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.55","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546096.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stretch Out and Compact: Workflow Scheduling with Resource Abundance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stretch Out and Compact: Workflow Scheduling with Resource Abundance","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13598629","publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546096/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546096/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stretch Out and Compact: Workflow Scheduling with Resource Abundance","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068885S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6546098,"authors":[{"name":"Linlin Wu","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems Laboratory, Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Linlin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37713318000"},{"name":"Saurabh Kumar Garg","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems Laboratory, Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Saurabh Kumar","lastName":"Garg","id":"37652310100"},{"name":"Rajkumar Buyya","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems Laboratory, Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Buyya","id":"37267557900"},{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["CA Technologies, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37070258200"},{"name":"Steve Versteeg","affiliation":["CA Technologies, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Versteeg","id":"37393678400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6465-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546098","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":761},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated SLA Negotiation Framework for Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546098.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"244","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.64","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Decision making","Availability","Radiation detectors","Software as a service","Cloud computing","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service level agreement","cloud computing","quality of service","SaaS provider","software-as-a-service","cloud market","service cost","service quality","SaaS broker","counter offer generation strategy","decision making heuristics","QoS parameter","automated SLA negotiation framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SLA negotiation","Software-as-a-Service","market-oriented","Cloud computing","resource allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546098","abstract":"A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a legal contract between parties to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) are provided the providers to the customers. A SLA negotiation between participants assists in defining the QoS requirements of critical service-based processes. However, the negotiation process for customers is a significant task particularly when there are multiple SaaS providers in the Cloud market, as service cost and quality are constantly changing and consumers have varying needs. Therefore, we propose a novel automated negotiation framework where a SaaS broker is utilized as the one-stop-shop for customers to achieve the required service efficiently when negotiating with multiple providers. The automated negotiation framework facilitates intelligent bilateral bargaining of SLAs between a SaaS broker and multiple providers to achieve different objectives for different participants. To maximize profit and improve customer satisfaction levels for the broker, we propose the design of counter offer generation strategies and decision making heuristics that take into account time, market constraints and trade-off between QoS parameters. Our negotiation heuristics are evaluated by extensive experimental studies of our framework using data from a real Cloud provider.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598631","htmlLink":"/document/6546098/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated SLA Negotiation Framework for Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated SLA Negotiation Framework for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073063S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6546108,"authors":[{"name":"Ketan Maheshwari","affiliation":["MCS Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ketan","lastName":"Maheshwari","id":"37686128500"},{"name":"Ken Birman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Birman","id":"37267640400"},{"name":"Justin Wozniak","affiliation":["MCS Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Wozniak","id":"37070064800"},{"name":"Devin Van Zandt","affiliation":["GE Energy Manage., Schenectady, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Devin Van","lastName":"Zandt"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6465-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546108","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating Cloud Computing Techniques for Smart Power Grid Design Using Parallel Scripting","abstract":"Applications used to evaluate next-generation electrical power grids(``smart grids'') are anticipated to be compute and data-intensive.

SBACS uses queue waiting time of transcoding servers to make admission control decisions for incoming video streams. It implements stream-based admission control with per stream admission. To ensure efficient utilization of the transcoding servers, video streams are segmented at the Group of Pictures level. In addition to the traditional rejection policy, SBACS also provides a stream deferment policy, which exploits cloud elasticity to allow temporary deferment of the incoming video streams. In other words, the admission controller can decide to admit, defer, or reject an incoming stream and hence reduce rejection rate. In order to prevent transcoding jitters in the admitted streams, we introduce a job scheduling mechanism, which drops a small proportion of video frames from a video segment to ensure continued delivery of video contents to the user. The approach is demonstrated in a discrete-event simulation with a series of experiments involving different load patterns and stream arrival rates.","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546129.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stream-Based Admission Control and Scheduling for Video Transcoding in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.21","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Stream-Based Admission Control and Scheduling for Video Transcoding in Cloud Computing","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598662","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6546129/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stream-Based Admission Control and Scheduling for Video Transcoding in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080527S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6546149,"authors":[{"name":"Jakub Szefer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Szefer","id":"37545420200"},{"name":"Ruby B.

To come ahead of this threat, we propose an economic measure to deter attacks and various service abuses in cloud computing applications. Our proposed defense is based on requiring a service user to pay a small deposit, using digital currency, before invoking the service. Once they are done using the service, and there has been no detected abuse or attack, the deposit is paid back by the service provider to the service user. If an attack or an abuse is detected, the service user is not paid back and the service provider gets to keep the deposit. We propose the use of micro payments with a decentralized nature and small transaction fees, such as the Bit coin digital currency. Moreover, thanks to the existence of money exchanges which convert the Bit coin currency to real world currency, service providers can recoup loses when they exchange the confiscated deposits for real world currency.","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.102","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546149.pdf","startPage":"630","endPage":"635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BitDeposit: Deterring Attacks and Abuses of Cloud Computing Services through Economic Measures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"BitDeposit: Deterring Attacks and Abuses of Cloud Computing Services through Economic Measures","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598682","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546149/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BitDeposit: Deterring Attacks and Abuses of Cloud Computing Services through Economic Measures","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043977S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6546155,"authors":[{"name":"Chaima Ghribi","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, UMR CNRS 5157, T\u00e9l\u00e9com SudParis, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Chaima","lastName":"Ghribi","id":"37070147600"},{"name":"Makhlouf Hadji","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, UMR CNRS 5157, T\u00e9l\u00e9com SudParis, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Makhlouf","lastName":"Hadji","id":"37903490600"},{"name":"Djamal Zeghlache","affiliation":["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, UMR CNRS 5157, T\u00e9l\u00e9com SudParis, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Djamal","lastName":"Zeghlache","id":"37269221800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6465-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546155","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Power demand","Energy consumption","Linear programming","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bin packing","cloud computing","computer centres","energy conservation","energy consumption","integer programming","linear programming","power aware computing","scheduling","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VM scheduling","cloud data center","exact allocation algorithm","energy efficient scheduling","virtual machine","energy aware allocation modeling","energy consumption","optimal allocation algorithm","consolidation algorithm","bin packing problem","linear formulation","integer formulation","VM migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","VM placement","VM migration","Cloud data center","Linear integer programming"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents two exact algorithms for energy efficient scheduling of virtual machines (VMs) in cloud data centers. Modeling of energy aware allocation and consolidation to minimize overall energy consumption leads us to the combination of an optimal allocation algorithm with a consolidation algorithm relying on migration of VMs at service departures. The optimal allocation algorithm is solved as a bin packing problem with a minimum power consumption objective. It is compared with an energy aware best fit algorithm. The exact migration algorithm results from a linear and integer formulation of VM migration to adapt placement when resources are released. The proposed migration is general and goes beyond the current state of the art by minimizing both the number of migrations needed for consolidation and energy consumption in a single algorithm with a set of valid inequalities and conditions. Experimental results show the benefits of combining the allocation and migration algorithms and demonstrate their ability to achieve significant energy savings while maintaining feasible convergence times when compared with the best fit heuristic.","doi":"10.1109/CCGrid.2013.89","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545869/6546039/06546155.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGrid.2013.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546039","startPage":"671","endPage":"678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient VM Scheduling for Cloud Data Centers: Exact Allocation and Migration Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient VM Scheduling for Cloud Data Centers: Exact Allocation and Migration Algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546155/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13598688","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6546155/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient VM Scheduling for Cloud Data Centers: Exact Allocation and Migration Algorithms","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4996a671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05022S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545869","isNumber":"6546039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545869","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6546039","articleId":"6546155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6546178,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Karmazin","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Karmazin","id":"37070479500"},{"name":"Carlos Tadeo Ortega Otero","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos Tadeo Ortega","lastName":"Otero","id":"38180819900"},{"name":"Rajit Manohar","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Rajit","lastName":"Manohar","id":"37275630900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5956-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-8681"}],"articleNumber":"6546178","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"abstract":"Asynchronous circuits are an attractive option to overcome many challenges currently faced by chip designers, such as increased process variation. However, the lack of CAD tools to generate asynchronous circuits limits the adoption of this promising technology. In this absence of CAD tools, the most time consuming part of chip design is the back-end (physical design) effort. We propose a complete design infrastructure to physically implement an asynchronous digital net list with orders of magnitude time savings over expert human effort. The core of this flow is the ability to generate customized logic that is compatible with available ASIC flows. We evaluate our flow against several asynchronous circuit benchmarks for which full custom physical implementations exist. Compared to hand-optimized custom designs, our flow produces layout that has, on average, a 51% area overhead, with a 12% increase in energy and a 9% increase in delay.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","asynchronous circuits","integrated circuit layout","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellTK","automated layout","nonstandard cells","chip designers","increased process variation","CAD tools","physical design","asynchronous digital net list","customized logic","ASIC flows","asynchronous circuit benchmarks","hand-optimized custom designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design Automation","Integrated Circuit Layout"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546178","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.2013.27","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545870/6546158/06546178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2013.27","startPage":"58","endPage":"66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546158","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"cellTK: Automated Layout for Asynchronous Circuits with Nonstandard Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"cellTK: Automated Layout for Asynchronous Circuits with Nonstandard Cells","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546178/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546178/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13597179","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"cellTK: Automated Layout for Asynchronous Circuits with Nonstandard Cells","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4970a058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072139S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545870","isNumber":"6546158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545870","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6546158","articleId":"6546178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6546179,"authors":[{"name":"Eslam Yahya","affiliation":["Center of Nanoelectron. & Devices (CND), American Univ. in Cairo/Zewail City of Sci. & Technol., Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Eslam","lastName":"Yahya","id":"37313255000"},{"name":"Laurent Fesquet","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Fesquet","id":"37295549700"},{"name":"Yehea Ismail","affiliation":["Center of Nanoelectronics and Devices (CND), American University in Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Yehea","lastName":"Ismail","id":"37271363500"},{"name":"Marc Renaudin","affiliation":["TIEMPO SAS, Montbonnot, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Renaudin","id":"37282559600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5956-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-8681"}],"articleNumber":"6546179","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","integrated circuit design","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical static timing analysis","conditional asynchronous circuits","model-based simulation","asynchronous designs","delay variability","SSTA framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conditional Asynchronous Circuits","Performance Analysis","SSTA for Asynchronous Circuits","STA","Delay Variability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546179","abstract":"Asynchronous designs are usually composed of conditional circuits.

Analyzing the performance of these circuits is challenging as the critical paths cannot be identified without knowing the exact sequence of modes of operations which is generally unknown during design time. We used Markov chain processes to model mode switching and unique choice Petri nets to model performance. We adopt a performance analysis scheme based on decomposing the behavior of the Petri net into marked graph components to reason about performance. The bounds are derived using linear programming based on the probability matrix of the Markov chain and can be incorporated in performance-aware optimization of conditional asynchronous circuits. To evaluate the accuracy of the bounds, the theory is applied to a new set of benchmark circuits that includes randomly generated conditional circuits (ISCAS89a) and an industrially-inspired example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deriving Performance Bounds for Conditional Asynchronous Circuits Using Linear Programing","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.2013.30","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6545870/6546158/06546180.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2013.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546158","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Deriving Performance Bounds for Conditional Asynchronous Circuits Using Linear Programing","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546180/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13597181","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deriving Performance Bounds for Conditional Asynchronous Circuits Using Linear Programing","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4970a075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084862S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6545870","isNumber":"6546158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6545870","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6546158","articleId":"6546180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546183,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelkarim Cherkaoui","affiliation":["Hubert Curien Laboratory, Saint Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Abdelkarim","lastName":"Cherkaoui","id":"38235283000"},{"name":"Viktor Fischer","affiliation":["Hubert Curien Laboratory, Saint Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37325929300"},{"name":"Alain Aubert","affiliation":["Hubert Curien Laboratory, Saint Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Aubert","id":"37407661600"},{"name":"Laurent Fesquet","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Fesquet","id":"37295549700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5956-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-8681"}],"articleNumber":"6546183","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":721},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","oscillators","random number generation","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-timed ring based true random number generator","ring stage structure","high-speed multiphase signals","Cyclone III","Xilinx Virtex 5 devices","quality random bit sequences","FIPS 140-1","NIST SP 800-22 statistical tests","self-timed ring oscillators","jitter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptography engineering","Random number generators","Self-timed rings"]}],"abstract":"Self-timed rings are oscillators in which several events can evolve evenly-spaced in time thanks to analog effects inherent to the ring stage structure.

The model is based on the multi-dimensional Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) for the generation of rain rate time series correlated in space on a specific area. Giving the geometrical and electrical characteristics of the link, rain attenuation first order statistics (long-term exceedance probability) can be generated. Moreover, the same space-time rain rate synthesizer can be used for the prediction of joint exceedance probability of rain attenuation and the performance of diversity systems. Preliminary results are shown and a preliminary comparison to the prediction of the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of rain attenuation derived by the recommendation of International Telecommunication Union (ITU), ITU-R. P. 618, using data from ITU's study group 3 (DBSG3), takes place.

In the scenery under study, the capability to track several satellites simultaneously, higher flexibility, lower production and maintenance cost, modularity and a more efficient use of the spectrum; are the most important advantage to boost up active antenna arrays over large dishes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546257.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","startPage":"252","endPage":"253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GEODA-SARAS: Multi-phased array planar antenna for satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"GEODA-SARAS: Multi-phased array planar antenna for satellite communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546257/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546257/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597529","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GEODA-SARAS: Multi-phased array planar antenna for satellite communications","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569688823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063091S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6546260,"authors":[{"name":"Livio Torrero","affiliation":["ICT Innovation, CSP, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Livio","lastName":"Torrero","id":"37692085500"},{"name":"Paolo Mollo","affiliation":["ICT Innovation, CSP, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Mollo","id":"37070378600"},{"name":"Andrea Molino","affiliation":["ICT Innovation, CSP, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Molino","id":"37332322800"},{"name":"Alberto Perotti","affiliation":["ICT Innovation, CSP, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Perotti","id":"37274366900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546260","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telemetry","Sensors","Global Positioning System","Anechoic chambers","Interference","Standards","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","aircraft testing","anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)","autonomous aerial vehicles","electromagnetic fields","field strength measurement","immunity testing","radio broadcasting","radio links","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","static condition","sensors","radio links","high-power radio broadcasting stations","field strength measurements","high EM field strength","anechoic chamber","UAV platform","EM field conditions","unmanned aerial vehicle platform","RF immunity testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EM immunity testing","UAV","telemetry","control"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we assess the reliability of a general-purpose low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform through RF immunity tests carried out under high EM field strength in an anechoic chamber.

A test methodology which emulates a real scattered environment consists of several factors that contribute to the variability of measurement results: the recent measurement campaign sponsored by the Third Generation Partnership Project through its Technical Specification Group defined as Radio Access Network 4 (3GPP TSG RAN4) is one example. Starting from the unknown radiated performance of devices under test (DUT), an effort to create a set of reference antennas was identified, generating the MIMO 2\u00d72 reference antennas [1], thus partially reducing the uncertainty over the candidate test methodologies. While the reference antennas define a known radiated performance of the DUT, any measurement campaign of this complexity must start from well defined baseline measurements among participant labs. Initially a simulation campaign was proposed to define such baseline. Soon this approach was refused due intellectual property (IP) embedded in each DUT manufacturer's mobile device chipset, therefore disabling any attempt to share realistic DUT dependent LTE MIMO full-link simulation models. Investigating other technically sound options to establish a baseline measurement, and protect IP from every DUT manufacturer, a specialized conducted measurement was elaborated. This work will introduce the concept behind this measurement, also known as MIMO 2\u00d72 Absolute Data Throughput.","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546267.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO 2\u00d72 absolute data throughput concept","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546267/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO 2\u00d72 absolute data throughput concept","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597539","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546267/","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO 2\u00d72 absolute data throughput concept","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569687409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067632S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6546271,"authors":[{"name":"Per-Simon Kildal","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per-Simon","lastName":"Kildal","id":"37280225200"},{"name":"Jan Carlsson","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Carlsson","id":"37280295000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546271","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Throughput","Wireless communication","Diversity methods","Antennas and propagation","Reverberation chambers","Anechoic chambers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","reverberation chambers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OTA testing","RIMP","pure-LOS reference environments","rich isotropic multipath","well-stirred reverberation chambers","anechoic chambers","multipath-related functions","MIMO","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OTA testing","small antennas","MIMO","reverberation chamber","anechoic chamber"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new systematic approach to OTA testing of wireless devices.

Herein, it is proposed how to test the effects of the users randomness in the pure-LOS in an anechoic chamber.

Reactive loading and time modulated switching techniques are applied to steer the beam of a uniform circular six element antenna array having a source element at its centre. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization is used to calculate optimal values for the reactances loading the parasitic elements, from which the gain can be optimized in a desired direction. For temporal switching, the GA is also used to determine the optimal on and off times for the parasitic elements. This gives the difference in the induced currents, optimies the gain and steers the beam in a desired direction. These methods are demonstrated for a vertically polarised array configuration operating at 2.45GHz. Simulation results show that near optimal solutions for gain, sidelobe level reduction, with VSWR 3 over a 100MHz bandwidth, and beam steering is achievable by the GA optimisation.","startPage":"347","endPage":"351","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation

A compromise between these extremes can be achieved by using reflector antennas with phased array feeds. A key research issue for array feeds is that phased array feeds are typically less efficient than traditional horn fed reflector antennas. If the efficiency and noise performance of a phased array feed is suboptimal, the performance gain of electronic beam steering is outweighed by the degradation in signal to noise ratio relative to a traditional horn feed. This paper reports on recent work aimed at realizing ultrahigh efficiency phased array feeds for two applications with the most demanding possible efficiency requirements: astronomical imaging and satellite communications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","startPage":"448","endPage":"449","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546303.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High efficiency phased array feed antennas for large radio telescopes and small satellite communications terminals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6546303/","displayDocTitle":"High efficiency phased array feed antennas for large radio telescopes and small satellite communications terminals","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597575","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High efficiency phased array feed antennas for large radio telescopes and small satellite communications terminals","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569678465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045093S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6546311,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schneider","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37323248800"},{"name":"Reiner S.

Once movement is detected, the IR sensor generates a voltage that can be varied to allow the tuning of the varactor and the tuning of the antenna operating frequency. The cognitive radio system is measured and analyzed for concept validation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546402/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13597672","publicationDate":"April 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546402/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tuning a cognitive radio antenna system with motion detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning a cognitive radio antenna system with motion detection","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569687965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048443S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546413,"authors":[{"name":"Evangelos D.

To decrease the mutual coupling between the radiating elements, the orientation of the second antenna is tilted from 100\u00b0 relative to the first one and a metallic wall connected to the ground plane is added. A final isolation better than -15 dB, is obtained with this structure. The simulated S-parameters are compared with measurement and a good agreement is found.

The focus of this paper is the performance evaluation of 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) for automotive applications. The results presented are based on field measurements, which were carried out on a test track in Munich, Germany. The focus is the spectrum in 800 MHz, which is more challenging for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna designs due to the difficulties of antenna decoupling. For the investigation an automotive qualified LTE MIMO antenna system is used. The presented results demonstrate that a performance deterioration of the antenna system occurs in areas close to the base station. It is shown that the deterioration is caused by shadowing between the two printed circuit board antennas comprising the antenna system. Moreover, it is illustrated that the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR), as opposed to the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), is a better suited parameter to determine the performance of the LTE link.","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546510.pdf","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO performance evaluation of automotive qualified LTE antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546510/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO performance evaluation of automotive qualified LTE antennas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597780","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546510/","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO performance evaluation of automotive qualified LTE antennas","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569678447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044545S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546511,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Carre\u00f1o","affiliation":["Intel Mobile Communications, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Carre\u00f1o","id":"38543102100"},{"name":"Wei Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Science Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Fan","id":"38498486400"},{"name":"Jesper \u00d8.

This way of testing has become a very important research topic especially because MIMO is now introduced into, for example, LTE and WiMAX systems. The main purpose of this testing is to validate whether the user equipment will have a good performance in real use. CTIA, 3GPP and COST are spending a big effort in standardizing the OTA testing procedure which is much more complex than similar single SISO OTA testing. The CTIA MIMO OTA SubGorup (MOSG) is comparing each proposed MIMO OTA technique to establish, first, an exact methodology for each technique and second, to ensure each of them offers comparable results. This contribution focuses on the multi-probe anechoic chamber solution and summarizes the activities related to the MIMO OTA lab being built at Aalborg University (AAU), Denmark and the testing being performed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test setup for anechoic room based MIMO OTA testing of LTE terminals","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546511.pdf","startPage":"1417","endPage":"1420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Test setup for anechoic room based MIMO OTA testing of LTE terminals","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546511/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597781","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test setup for anechoic room based MIMO OTA testing of LTE terminals","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569686591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041565S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546512,"authors":[{"name":"Pekka Ky\u00f6sti","affiliation":["Elektrobit, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Ky\u00f6sti","id":"37542923300"},{"name":"Afroza Khatun","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, SMARAD, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Afroza","lastName":"Khatun","id":"37542767600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546512","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Correlation","Channel models","Three-dimensional displays","MIMO","Azimuth","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)","antenna arrays","antenna testing","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D MIMO over-the-air testing","probe configurations","three dimensional anechoic chamber","fading emulator based MIMO OTA testing","IMT-Advanced channel models","spatial correlation function","synthesis error","target electric field","resulting field","multiantenna terminals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO OTA","antenna","testing","channel model"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses probe configurations for three dimensional (3D) anechoic chamber and fading emulator based MIMO Over-the-Air (OTA) testing.

Specifically, a measurement based channel model is applied which allows the embedding of application antennas such as the proposed CTIA reference antennas. Three different channel models (a 3-D full, a 2-D full and a 2-D single polarimetric model) are considered. Numerical results on system capacity and throughput simulations are illustrated by several examples. It is found that the relative error in terms of capacity between the 3-D full and the 2-D full polarimetric model is less than 10% for uplink transmissions when the signal-to-noise ratio target is reached with the available transmit power. Further, the results show that when completely neglecting the polarization characteristics of the propagation environment, the throughput and capacity errors can rise up to 50%. In addition, simulation results indicate that the LTE system with CTIA \u201cNominal\u201d reference antennas outperforms the LTE system with \u201cGood\u201d reference antennas for the uplink transmission in some channel fading environments.","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546610.pdf","startPage":"1856","endPage":"1860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of channel model simplifications for MIMO OTA LTE UE testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546610/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of channel model simplifications for MIMO OTA LTE UE testing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597880","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546610/","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of channel model simplifications for MIMO OTA LTE UE testing","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569711045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075865S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546621,"authors":[{"name":"Raffaele D'Errico","affiliation":["CEA, Minatec Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Raffaele","lastName":"D'Errico","id":"37391780300"},{"name":"Julien Keignart","affiliation":["CEA, Minatec Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Keignart","id":"37298905500"},{"name":"Lionel Rudant","affiliation":["CEA, Minatec Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Rudant","id":"37318683900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546621","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546621","abstract":"This paper presents a double polarized model of UWB backscattering channel for passive RFID applications enabling identification and localization.

Block Diagonalization (BD) has been proposed in order to realize MU-MIMO broadcast. The BD algorithm cancels inter-user interference by creating the weights so that the channel matrixes for the other users are set to be zero matrixes. However, when the number of transmit antennas is equals to the total number of received antennas, the transmission rate by the BD algorithm is decreased. In this paper, we propose the antenna selection method to reduce the number of nulls for the other users except an intended user by the BD algorithm. It is verified that the proposed method is effective compared to the conventional BD algorithm, especially, when the number of users is increased with a low bit rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546668.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","startPage":"2118","endPage":"2122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Diagonalization with user antenna selection for multiuser MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Block Diagonalization with user antenna selection for multiuser MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546668/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597937","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Diagonalization with user antenna selection for multiuser MIMO systems","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569688663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060779S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546669,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed B.

The DGS is capable of improving the isolation of a dual band antenna especially for the low bands (800MHz). A 4-shaped MIMO antenna system is used to test the performance of the isolation structure. The proposed method relies on a modified dumbbell shaped DGS to improve the isolation for high band (2440-2980). The primary rectangles of the dumbbell are loaded with a spiral to cover the low band (803-823MHz). The minimum isolation for the low band and high band was approximately 17dB and 9dB respectively. A minimum isolation improvement of 14dB and 4dB was observed for the low band and high band respectively compared to the original MIMO antenna system under test without such a structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546669.pdf","startPage":"2123","endPage":"2126","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A defected ground structure for isolation enhancement in a printed MIMO antenna system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Spirals","Dual band","Bandwidth","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defected ground structure","isolation enhancement","printed MIMO antenna system","DGS","isolation technique","printed antennas","dual band antenna","isolation structure","frequency 800 MHz","frequency 803 MHz to 823 MHz","gain 17 dB","gain 9 dB","gain 14 dB","gain 4 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"A defected ground structure for isolation enhancement in a printed MIMO antenna system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546669/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597938","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A defected ground structure for isolation enhancement in a printed MIMO antenna system","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569675679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05215S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546686,"authors":[{"name":"K.Ch Sri Kavya","affiliation":["Department of ECE, K L University, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"K.Ch Sri","lastName":"Kavya","id":"37070217100"},{"name":"Sarat K Kotamraju","affiliation":["K L University, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Sarat K","lastName":"Kotamraju","id":"37070003900"},{"name":"Habibulla Khan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, K L University, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Habibulla","lastName":"Khan","id":"38570037800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546686","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Size measurement","Sensor arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency modulation","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","calibration","compressed sensing","linear antenna arrays","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear array antenna","calibration","restoration technique","near-field compressed sensing","excitation coefficients","phased array antenna","dithering concepts","near field detection","adaptive correction","multiple near field sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["phased array antenna","excitation coefficient errors","coefficient correction","multiple near field sensors","calibration"]}],"abstract":"An idea of correcting the excitation coefficients which tend to perturb due to various reasons in a phased array antenna is proposed by a method where the concepts of dithering and restoration are applied for the magnitude and phase of the excitation of individual elements with the help of near field detection and calculations.

From the measurements, signal fading, delay and Doppler spread are estimated. Results show that delay spread will have no significant effect for 36 MHz and 72 MHz transponders, so no channel equalization would be required. However, a periodic signal fading exists, due to the blockage of the main radio signal by the rotor blades. Compensating this fading would require some kind of Automatic Gain Control or diversity technique at the helicopter.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546707.pdf","startPage":"2322","endPage":"2325","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental estimation of propagation impairments of a satellite-to-helicopter radio channel at Ku band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Helicopters","Fading","Delays","Receivers","Blades","Doppler effect","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic gain control","fading","microwave propagation","random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagation impairments","satellite-to-helicopter radio channel characterization experiment","Ku band","sweep time delay cross correlation","STDCC sounder","pseudorandom binary sequence","PRBS","signal fading","Doppler spread","delay spread","transponders","periodic signal fading","radio signal blockage","rotor blades","automatic gain control","diversity technique","frequency 14.25 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["K band","delay spread","diversity","Doppler","radio channel","pseudo random noise sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Experimental estimation of propagation impairments of a satellite-to-helicopter radio channel at Ku band","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546707/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597975","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental estimation of propagation impairments of a satellite-to-helicopter radio channel at Ku band","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569687191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058257S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6546708,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Alasali","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Systems Wireless, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Alasali","id":"37069983900"},{"name":"Claes Beckman","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Systems Wireless, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Claes","lastName":"Beckman","id":"37070392000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546708","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":513},"abstract":"Providing passenger internet on board trains with continuous connectivity at high speeds and over large rural distances is a challenging issue. A frequently used solution to the problem is to use an on board WiFi network connected to the 3G or 4G networks deployed outside the train. In order to be able to provide the capacity and the data rates that tomorrow's business travelers are expecting it has been suggested to use a combination of MIMO and carrier aggregation in the LTE-Advance standard. In this study, we practically investigate the plausibility of using MIMO functionality in an 900 LTE system when the receive antennas are mounted at a train roof about 4m above ground and the base stations antennas are on average placed 2.3km away from the track in towers with an average height of 45m and, hence, most of the time in line of site. It is found that along our test route MIMO is in practice supported by the radio channel at around 70% of the time when the train is travelling with an average speed of 185km/h and the MIMO antennas are mounted 10.5m apart.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546708.pdf","startPage":"2327","endPage":"2330","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE MIMO performance measurements on trains","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Antenna measurements","Business","MIMO","Antennas","Indexes","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","antenna arrays","Internet","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","railway communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE MIMO performance measurements","passenger Internet","board trains","board WiFi network","3G networks","4G networks","LTE-ADVANCE standard","base stations","MIMO antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Train communications","Measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"LTE MIMO performance measurements on trains","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546708/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13597976","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE MIMO performance measurements on trains","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569688721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054026S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6546715,"authors":[{"name":"I. de la Torre","affiliation":["IMST GmbH, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany"],"firstName":"I.","lastName":"de la Torre","id":"38056928600"},{"name":"J.

The SMI is introduced as a \u201cgreen\u201d index that expresses the minimum SNR required by the MIMO terminal in order to support spatial multiplexing.

Each of the three terminals is equipped with a slot-monopole antenna and a planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA). The slot monopole is fixed at one edge of the chassis, whereas the location of the PIFA differs among the terminals to provide different bandwidth and isolation characteristics in free space (FS). The results show that adaptive matching leads to an average capacity gain of up to 24% at the center frequency, favoring the terminal with the smallest antenna bandwidth and the largest isolation. However, the maximum capacity gain from adaptive matching decreases to 15.7% when averaged over the entire system bandwidth. Moreover, the terminal with moderate antenna bandwidth and isolation offers the best overall absolute capacity performance under different user scenarios, indicating a design tradeoff. These results highlight important design considerations for MIMO terminals with adaptive impedance matching.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546764.pdf","startPage":"2590","endPage":"2594","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive impedance matching performance of MIMO terminals with different bandwidth and isolation properties in realistic user scenarios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Prototypes","Adaptive arrays","MIMO","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","impedance matching","MIMO communication","monopole antenna arrays","planar inverted-F antennas","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna bandwidth","FS","free space","isolation characteristics","PIFA","planar inverted-F antenna","slot-monopole antenna","LTE band","three dual-antenna multiple-input multiple-output terminals","channel capacity","MIMO terminals","adaptive impedance matching performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive impedance matching","channel capacity","terminal antennas","user effects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive impedance matching performance of MIMO terminals with different bandwidth and isolation properties in realistic user scenarios","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546764/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598031","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive impedance matching performance of MIMO terminals with different bandwidth and isolation properties in realistic user scenarios","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569684141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07404S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546766,"authors":[{"name":"Elpiniki Tsakalaki","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Elpiniki","lastName":"Tsakalaki","id":"37547442300"},{"name":"Osama Alrabadi","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Osama","lastName":"Alrabadi","id":"37546411600"},{"name":"Elisabeth de Carvalho","affiliation":["Antennas, Propagation and Radio Networking Section, Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Elisabeth","lastName":"de Carvalho","id":"37293743600"},{"name":"Gert F.

However, the new DGF expression may cause long runtimes and accuracy problems. Therefore, we have proposed the DGF implementation on the GPU employing a multiple precision arithmetic library and the CUDA parallel programming interface. We have obtained six-fold speedup of the GPU implementation over a code executed on a multicore central processing unit. Achieved results indicate that GPUs represent an inexpensive source of computational power for the DGF computations.","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546777.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","startPage":"2643","endPage":"2646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-accelerated computations of FDTD-compatible Green's function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPU-accelerated computations of FDTD-compatible Green's function","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546777/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598044","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6546777/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-accelerated computations of FDTD-compatible Green's function","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569678749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053184S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546808,"authors":[{"name":"Minseok Kim","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Minseok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278674100"},{"name":"Yohei Konishi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Konishi","id":"37402141600"},{"name":"Yuyuan Chang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuyuan Chang","id":"38260955200"},{"name":"Jun-ichi Takada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun-ichi","lastName":"Takada","id":"37269840500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546808","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","polarisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor wideband MIMO channels","path loss","path delay","polarizations","channel capacity","dual polarized MIMO configuration","frequency 11 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the measurement results of indoor wideband MIMO channels at 11 GHz will be presented.

The SDoF depends on multipath richness of the propagation channel and antenna aperture size, and indicates the number of effective antenna elements for the spatial multiplexing on the antenna aperture. We first define the SDoF using expression of propagation channels in plane and spherical wave domains. The SDoF is estimated for indoor MIMO mobile scenarios based on measurements, revealing that at least two SDoFs corresponding to two orthogonal polarizations are always available. Furthermore, the SDoF is mostly less than 10 when the antenna aperture size at the base and mobile sides is 3\u03bb\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and less than 4 if the aperture size is 0.25\u03bb\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, revealing feasibility of spatial multiplexing with at most 4 eigenmodes using an electrically small antenna aperture at the mobile end. Significant fluctuation of the SDoF is observed during a mobile is in motion even though there is always a line-of-sight (LOS). The fluctuation is attributed to difference in LOS path dominance over other multipath components and varying angular distribution of the multipaths.","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546810.pdf","startPage":"2801","endPage":"2805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of spatial degrees-of-freedom in MIMO mobile channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546810/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of spatial degrees-of-freedom in MIMO mobile channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598077","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546810/","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of spatial degrees-of-freedom in MIMO mobile channels","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569682357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095148S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6546811,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Jacob","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37303837700"},{"name":"Sebastian Priebe","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Priebe","id":"37391520300"},{"name":"Thomas K\u00fcrner","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"K\u00fcrner","id":"37299707500"},{"name":"Michael Peter","affiliation":["Robert Felbecker and Wilhelm Keusgen, Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Peter","id":"37320668600"},{"name":"Mike Wisotzki","affiliation":["Robert Felbecker and Wilhelm Keusgen, Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Wisotzki","id":"37592286100"},{"name":"Robert Felbecker","affiliation":["Robert Felbecker and Wilhelm Keusgen, Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Felbecker","id":"37303557200"},{"name":"Wilhelm Keusgen","affiliation":["Robert Felbecker and Wilhelm Keusgen, Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Wilhelm","lastName":"Keusgen","id":"37282408400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546811","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":593},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546811","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Attenuation","Shadow mapping","Delays","Probability","Least squares approximations","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 human blockage model","real-time broadband radio channel measurements","multiple persons","antenna configurations","extended model","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an extension and a holistic validation of the IEEE 802.11ad 60 GHz human blockage model.

The main difference is that the temporal fading for a stationary UE, in a rich scattering environment, is typically very small having Ricean statistics with large K values (K>10dB). This is in contrast to the traditional channel modeling scenario in which the UE is moving and the temporal fading exhibits Rayleigh statistics. Further, simple and straightforward temporal channel modeling, which conveniently may be added to standard ray based channel models, is presented and also successfully validated by measurements. The proposed modeling is simple and has thus some limitations. Firstly the model assumes that the scattered waves originate from a single point at the centre of the scatterer. Moreover, it is not taken into account that the scattered waves themselves are reflected off objects in the environment. This might have some negative impact if e.g. beamforming techniques are used to null out the temporal varying contribution. Secondly, the model has only been evaluated based on a few measured scenarios. In order to assess if the model is generally valid more measurements in different scenarios such as macrocell, outdoor, shopping mall etc. have to be performed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546812/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13598079","publicationDate":"April 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546812/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel modeling for the stationary UE scenario","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel modeling for the stationary UE scenario","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569686527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064373S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6546845,"authors":[{"name":"Emre Erdil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Erdil","id":"37301235000"},{"name":"Kagan Topalli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TED University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kagan","lastName":"Topalli","id":"37282287000"},{"name":"\u00d6zge Zorlu","affiliation":["METU-MEMS Research and Applications Centre, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00d6zge","lastName":"Zorlu","id":"37863131800"},{"name":"Taylan Toral","affiliation":["METU-MEMS Research and Applications Centre, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Taylan","lastName":"Toral","id":"37070143400"},{"name":"Ender Yildirim","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Cankaya University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ender","lastName":"Yildirim","id":"37982989500"},{"name":"Haluk Kulah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, METU-MEMS Research and Applications Centre, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Haluk","lastName":"Kulah","id":"37265305800"},{"name":"Ozlem Aydin Civi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozlem Aydin","lastName":"Civi","id":"37301230200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-3-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2187-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-88-907018-1-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6546845","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":683},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metals","Liquids","Microfluidics","Antennas","Lenses","Structural rings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam steering","microfluidics","polarisation","slot antenna arrays","soft lithography","substrates","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable microfluidic transmitarray unit cell","reconfigurable circularly polarized transmitarray unit cell","double layer nested split ring slots","microfluidic channels","liquid metal injection","beam steering","rotational phase shifting","liquid metal manipulation","X-band unit cell prototypes","glass substrate","metal film","slot channels","polydimethylsiloxane","PDMS","soft lithography techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transmitarray","lens array","microfluidics","reconfigurable","beam steering","split ring","circularly polarized","liquid metal"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel microfluidics based approach to develop a reconfigurable circularly polarized transmitarray unit cell.

In this work a fast DS model which doesn't require discretization is implemented into a Ray Tracing propagation simulator and performance is assessed in terms of CPU time and result accuracy with respect to more conventional DS models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546863.pdf","startPage":"3039","endPage":"3042","publicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6546863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a fast distributed scattering model for Ray Tracing prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Computational modeling","Ray tracing","Buildings","Predictive models","Europe","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast distributed scattering model","diffuse scattering modelling","ray tracing propagation prediction tool","wall-surface discretization","visibility algorithm","fast DS model","CPU time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio Propagation","Multipath","Diffuse Scattering","Ray Tracing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a fast distributed scattering model for Ray Tracing prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6546863/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598130","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a fast distributed scattering model for Ray Tracing prediction","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569688675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069063S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6546938,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The cognitive radio technology appears on the scene as a solution to improve the spectrum efficiency by increasing the density of users on radio frequencies. However, there are still open issues to optimize techniques for radio spectrum dynamic access, in order to achieve proficiently the spectral vacancy, called white spaces. In this study measurements were performed on various primary users on the 450 MHz band, which is vastly used, in order to understand the spectrum occupancy models. In the research, the captured signals were demodulated and the audio communication was evaluated in order to identify each sequence considered as a conversation, requiring human interpretation. Within each conversation, bursts of audio (speech of interlocutors) were listed. Besides it the spaces between these bursts and the intervals among conversations were recorded as modeling parameters. The results were statistically analyzed and the study proposes to use this data as a basis for developing an algorithm that aims to improve techniques for access the radio spectrum to enable the powerfully utilization of cognitive radios.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546197","startPage":"3385","endPage":"3389","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526699/6546197/06546938.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum occupancy modeling on the 450 MHz band for cognitive radio application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6546938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6546938/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum occupancy modeling on the 450 MHz band for cognitive radio application","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13598204","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum occupancy modeling on the 450 MHz band for cognitive radio application","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"1569688619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065553S","chronDate":"8-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526699","isNumber":"6546197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526699","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6546197","articleId":"6546938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6546950,"authors":[{"name":"Ho Manh Linh","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Energia, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"lastName":"Ho Manh Linh","id":"38264583100"},{"name":"M.

A few examples that have received widespread adoption include stack canaries, non-executable memory, and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). When implemented correctly (i.e., a given system fully supports these protection methods and no information leak exists), the attack surface is significantly reduced and typical exploitation strategies are severely thwarted. All modern desktop and server operating systems support these techniques and ASLR has also been added to different mobile operating systems recently. In this paper, we study the limitations of kernel space ASLR against a local attacker with restricted privileges. We show that an adversary can implement a generic side channel attack against the memory management system to deduce information about the privileged address space layout. Our approach is based on the intrinsic property that the different caches are shared resources on computer systems. We introduce three implementations of our methodology and show that our attacks are feasible on four different x86-based CPUs (both 32- and 64-bit architectures) and also applicable to virtual machines. As a result, we can successfully circumvent kernel space ASLR on current operating systems. Furthermore, we also discuss mitigation strategies against our attacks, and propose and implement a defense solution with negligible performance overhead.","doi":"10.1109/SP.2013.23","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel7/6547086/6547088/06547110.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2013.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Timing Side Channel Attacks against Kernel Space ASLR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Practical Timing Side Channel Attacks against Kernel Space ASLR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13597229","htmlLink":"/document/6547110/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Timing Side Channel Attacks against Kernel Space ASLR","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"4977a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087437S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6547086","isNumber":"6547088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6547086","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6547088","articleId":"6547110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547113,"authors":[{"name":"Bryan Parno","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, USA"],"firstName":"Bryan","lastName":"Parno","id":"37424566400"},{"name":"Jon Howell","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, USA"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Howell","id":"37070347700"},{"name":"Craig Gentry","affiliation":["IBM Research, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Gentry","id":"37823156200"},{"name":"Mariana Raykova","affiliation":["IBM Research, USA"],"firstName":"Mariana","lastName":"Raykova","id":"38490314900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4977-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6166-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-6011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1081-6011"}],"articleNumber":"6547113","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":310,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":6060},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547113","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Polynomials","Protocols","Wires","Cryptography","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","cryptographic protocols","formal verification","program compilers","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pinocchio","verifiable computation protocol","correctness verification","cryptographic assumptions","public evaluation key","public verification key","general-purpose system","zero-knowledge proofs","base protocol","end-to-end toolchain"]}],"abstract":"To instill greater confidence in computations outsourced to the cloud, clients should be able to verify the correctness of the results returned. To this end, we introduce Pinocchio, a built system for efficiently verifying general computations while relying only on cryptographic assumptions. With Pinocchio, the client creates a public evaluation key to describe her computation; this setup is proportional to evaluating the computation once. The worker then evaluates the computation on a particular input and uses the evaluation key to produce a proof of correctness. The proof is only 288 bytes, regardless of the computation performed or the size of the inputs and outputs. Anyone can use a public verification key to check the proof. Crucially, our evaluation on seven applications demonstrates that Pinocchio is efficient in practice too. Pinocchio's verification time is typically 10ms: 5-7 orders of magnitude less than previous work; indeed Pinocchio is the first general-purpose system to demonstrate verification cheaper than native execution (for some apps). Pinocchio also reduces the worker's proof effort by an additional 19-60x. As an additional feature, Pinocchio generalizes to zero-knowledge proofs at a negligible cost over the base protocol. Finally, to aid development, Pinocchio provides an end-to-end toolchain that compiles a subset of C into programs that implement the verifiable computation protocol.","doi":"10.1109/SP.2013.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2013.47","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel7/6547086/6547088/06547113.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pinocchio: Nearly Practical Verifiable Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pinocchio: Nearly Practical Verifiable Computation","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13597232","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547113/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pinocchio: Nearly Practical Verifiable Computation","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"4977a238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107938S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6547086","isNumber":"6547088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6547086","citationCount":"310","xplore-issue":"6547088","articleId":"6547113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547115,"authors":[{"name":"Yinglei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yinglei","lastName":"Wang","id":"38252566400"},{"name":"Wing-kei Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wing-kei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37715741900"},{"name":"Sarah Q.

The method hides data within an analog characteristic of Flash, the program time of individual bits. Because the technique uses analog behaviors, normal Flash memory operations are not affected and hidden information is invisible in the data stored in the memory. Even if an attacker checks a Flash chip's analog characteristics, experimental results indicate that the hidden information is difficult to distinguish from inherent manufacturing variation or normal wear on the device. Moreover, the hidden data can survive erasure of the Flash memory data, and the technique can be used on current Flash chips without hardware changes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13597234","htmlLink":"/document/6547115/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hiding Information in Flash Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hiding Information in Flash Memory","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"4977a271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059135S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6547086","isNumber":"6547088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6547086","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6547088","articleId":"6547115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547116,"authors":[{"name":"Ulrich R\u00fchrmair","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"R\u00fchrmair","id":"37394026600"},{"name":"Marten van Dijk","affiliation":["CSAIL, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Marten","lastName":"van Dijk","id":"37283093800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4977-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6166-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-6011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1081-6011"}],"articleNumber":"6547116","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":2376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Cryptography","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Hardware","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PUF-based scheme","physical unclonable function","security protocol","security evaluation","cryptographic protocol","oblivious transfer protocol","OT protocol","bit commitment protocol","BC protocol","key exchange protocol","KE protocol","cryptographic primitive","bounded storage model","quantum cryptography","noise-based cryptography","adversarial attack model","good PUF model","bad PUF model","PUF reuse model","controlled PUF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["(Strong) Physical Unclonable Functions","(Strong) PUFs","Attack Models","Oblivious Transfer","Bit Commitment","Key Exchange","Erasable PUFs","Certifiable PUFs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547116","abstract":"In recent years, PUF-based schemes have not only been suggested for the basic security tasks of tamper sensitive key storage or system identification, but also for more complex cryptographic protocols like oblivious transfer (OT), bit commitment (BC), or key exchange (KE). In these works, so-called \"Strong PUFs\" are regarded as a new, fundamental cryptographic primitive of their own, comparable to the bounded storage model, quantum cryptography, or noisebased cryptography. This paper continues this line of research, investigating the correct adversarial attack model and the actual security of such protocols. In its first part, we define and compare different attack models. They reach from a clean, first setting termed the \"stand-alone, good PUF model\" to stronger scenarios like the \"bad PUF model\" and the \"PUF re-use model\". We argue why these attack models are realistic, and that existing protocols would be faced with them if used in practice. In the second part, we execute exemplary security analyses of existing schemes in the new attack models. The evaluated protocols include recent schemes from Brzuska et al. published at Crypto 2011 [1] and from Ostrovsky et al. [18]. While a number of protocols are certainly secure in their own, original attack models, the security of none of the considered protocols for OT, BC, or KE is maintained in all of the new, realistic scenarios. One consequence of our work is that the design of advanced cryptographic PUF protocols needs to be strongly reconsidered. Furthermore, it suggests that Strong PUFs require additional hardware properties in order to be broadly usable in such protocols: Firstly, they should ideally be \"erasable\", meaning that single PUF-responses can be erased without affecting other responses. If the area efficient implementation of this feature turns out to be difficult, new forms of Controlled PUFs [8] (such as Logically Erasable and Logically Reconfigurable PUFs [13]) may suffice in certain applications. Secondly, PUFs should be \"certifiable\", meaning that one can verify that the PUF has been produced faithfully and has not been manipulated in any way afterwards. The combined implementation of these features represents a pressing and challenging problem, which we pose to the PUF hardware community in this work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547088","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel7/6547086/6547088/06547116.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SP.2013.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2013.27","startPage":"286","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PUFs in Security Protocols: Attack Models and Security Evaluations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547116/","displayDocTitle":"PUFs in Security Protocols: Attack Models and Security Evaluations","htmlLink":"/document/6547116/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13597235","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PUFs in Security Protocols: Attack Models and Security Evaluations","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"4977a286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071437S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6547086","isNumber":"6547088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6547086","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6547088","articleId":"6547116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547119,"authors":[{"name":"Valeria Nikolaenko","affiliation":["Stanford University, USA"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Nikolaenko","id":"37070436300"},{"name":"Udi Weinsberg","affiliation":["Technicolor, France"],"firstName":"Udi","lastName":"Weinsberg","id":"37322423000"},{"name":"Stratis Ioannidis","affiliation":["Technicolor, France"],"firstName":"Stratis","lastName":"Ioannidis","id":"37300572200"},{"name":"Marc Joye","affiliation":["Technicolor, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Joye","id":"37324735300"},{"name":"Dan Boneh","affiliation":["Stanford University, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Boneh","id":"37374985800"},{"name":"Nina Taft","affiliation":["Technicolor, France"],"firstName":"Nina","lastName":"Taft","id":"37269298300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4977-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6166-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-6011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1081-6011"}],"articleNumber":"6547119","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":149,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":4845},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Protocols","Vectors","Integrated circuit modeling","Data models","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving ridge regression","best-fit linear curve","machine learning operation","homomorphic encryption","Yao garbled circuits"]}],"abstract":"Ridge regression is an algorithm that takes as input a large number of data points and finds the best-fit linear curve through these points.

The ideal security guarantee for order-preserving encryption put forth in the literature is for the ciphertexts to reveal no information about the plaintexts besides order. Even though more than a dozen schemes were proposed, all these schemes leak more information than order. This paper presents the first order-preserving scheme that achieves ideal security. Our main technique is mutable ciphertexts, meaning that over time, the ciphertexts for a small number of plaintext values change, and we prove that mutable ciphertexts are needed for ideal security. Our resulting protocol is interactive, with a small number of interactions. We implemented our scheme and evaluated it on microbenchmarks and in the context of an encrypted MySQL database application. We show that in addition to providing ideal security, our scheme achieves 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher performance than the state-of-the-art order-preserving encryption scheme, which is less secure than our scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and

provides a strong protection against modern control-flow hijacking attacks. However, performance and compatibility issues limit its adoption. We propose a new practical and realistic protection method called CCFIR (Compact Control Flow Integrity and Randomization), which addresses the main barriers to CFI adoption. CCFIR collects all legal targets of indirect control-transfer instructions, puts them into a dedicated \"Springboard section\" in a random order, and then limits indirect transfers to flow only to them. Using the Springboard section for targets, CCFIR can validate a target more simply and faster than traditional CFI, and provide support for on-site target-randomization as well as better compatibility. Based on these approaches, CCFIR can stop control-flow hijacking attacks including ROP and return-into-libc. Results show that ROP gadgets are all eliminated. We observe that with the wide deployment of ASLR, Windows/x86 PE executables contain enough information in relocation tables which CCFIR can use to find all legal instructions and jump targets reliably, without source code or symbol information. We evaluate our prototype implementation on common web browsers and the SPEC CPU2000 suite: CCFIR protects large applications such as GCC and Firefox completely automatically, and has low performance overhead of about 3.6%/8.6% (average/max) using SPECint2000. Experiments on real-world exploits also show that CCFIR-hardened versions of IE6, Firefox 3.6 and other applications are protected effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547133/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547133/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13597252","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Practical Control Flow Integrity and Randomization for Binary Executables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Control Flow Integrity and Randomization for Binary Executables","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"4977a559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106204S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6547086","isNumber":"6547088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6547086","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6547088","articleId":"6547133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":6547134,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Z.

In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of a framework based on a novel attack strategy, dubbed just-in-time code reuse, that undermines the benefits of fine-grained ASLR. Specifically, we derail the assumptions embodied in fine-grained ASLR by exploiting the ability to repeatedly abuse a memory disclosure to map an application's memory layout on-the-fly, dynamically discover API functions and gadgets, and JIT-compile a target program using those gadgets -- all within a script environment at the time an exploit is launched. We demonstrate the power of our framework by using it in conjunction with a real-world exploit against Internet Explorer, and also provide extensive evaluations that demonstrate the practicality of just-in-time code reuse attacks. Our findings suggest that fine-grained ASLR may not be as promising as first thought.","doi":"10.1109/SP.2013.45","startPage":"574","endPage":"588","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2013.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547088","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel7/6547086/6547088/06547134.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Just-In-Time Code Reuse: On the Effectiveness of Fine-Grained Address Space Layout Randomization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547134/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Just-In-Time Code Reuse: On the Effectiveness of Fine-Grained Address Space Layout Randomization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547134/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13597253","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Just-In-Time Code Reuse: On the Effectiveness of Fine-Grained Address Space Layout Randomization","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"4977a574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138122S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6547086","isNumber":"6547088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6547086","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"6547088","articleId":"6547134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":6547141,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhou Sun","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Science, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6945935/6547141/sun-103-small.gif","p":["Yizhou Sun received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA, in 2012.

While a bulk of research has focused on mining evolutionary patterns of homogeneous networks (e.g., networks of friends), however, most real-world networks are heterogeneous, containing objects of different types, such as authors, papers, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network. Modeling co-evolution of multityped objects can capture richer information than that on single-typed objects alone. For example, studying co-evolution of authors, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network alone. In this paper, we study mining co-evolution of multityped objects in a special type of heterogeneous networks, called star networks, and examine how the multityped objects influence each other in the network evolution. A hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model-based evolution model is proposed, which detects the co-evolution of multityped objects in the form of multityped cluster evolution in dynamic star networks. An efficient inference algorithm is provided to learn the proposed model. Experiments on several real networks (DBLP, Twitter, and Delicious) validate the effectiveness of the model and the scalability of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2013.103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6945935/06547141.pdf","startPage":"2942","endPage":"2955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6945935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2013.103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-Evolution of Multi-Typed Objects in Dynamic Star Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Co-Evolution of Multi-Typed Objects in Dynamic Star Networks","volume":"26","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"14710805","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6547141/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-Evolution of Multi-Typed Objects in Dynamic Star Networks","sourcePdf":"tkde-sun-103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106901S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6945935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6945935","articleId":"6547141","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6547148,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Nitti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6814899/6547148/nitti-105-small.gif","p":["Michele Nitti received the master's degree in telecommunication engineering with full marks in 2009 from the University of Cagliari.

Within this scenario, we focus on the problem of understanding how the information provided by members of the social IoT has to be processed so as to build a reliable system on the basis of the behavior of the objects. We define two models for trustworthiness management starting from the solutions proposed for P2P and social networks. In the subjective model each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own experience and on the opinion of the friends in common with the potential service providers. In the objective model, the information about each node is distributed and stored making use of a distributed hash table structure so that any node can make use of the same information. Simulations show how the proposed models can effectively isolate almost any malicious nodes in the network at the expenses of an increase in the network traffic for feedback exchange.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","volume":"26","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14299510","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6547148/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Trustworthiness Management in the Social Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trustworthiness Management in the Social Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tkde-atzori-105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104732S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6814899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"6814899","articleId":"6547148","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6547154,"authors":[{"name":"Yiorgos Sfikas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Sfikas","id":"37320311000"},{"name":"Yiorgos E.

The neighborhood pattern sensitive fault (NPSF) model is suitable to address such faulty behaviors and identify them during the characterization and/or test of new DRAM chips. However, NPSF test algorithms are extremely time-consuming and therefore not economically affordable. In this brief, we show how layout information can be used to refine and significantly simplify the NPSF model and reduce the test time complexity. As a case study, the folded DRAM array is considered. A realistic NPSF model, the \u0394-type neighborhood, is introduced together with a time efficient test algorithm which is more than two-times cheaper than traditional ones. Even when incorporating bit-line influence and word-line coupling effects, along with NPSFs, the test algorithm time complexity almost remains unaltered. Therefore, the proposed approach makes NPSF testing economically affordable, and hence, suitable for the characterization/test of dense DRAMs in the nanoera.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2266281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6819107/06547154.pdf","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2266281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layout-Based Refined NPSF Model for DRAM Characterization and Testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Layout-Based Refined NPSF Model for DRAM Characterization and Testing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547154/","publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14319006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547154/","volume":"22","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union and Greek national funds"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout-Based Refined NPSF Model for DRAM Characterization and Testing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tsiatouhas-2266281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059164S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6819107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6819107","articleId":"6547154","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6547156,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron J.

In this paper, a general compensation method to cope with this imbalance issue is proposed with rigorous analysis and design formulas. The compensation relies on two intentionally shortened coupling sections and a pair of short-circuited transmission lines as the terminations. The proposed method is able to deal with a long connecting segment between the balance ports as long as the coupling sections are tight enough at the desired frequencies. The theory and formulation are first treated using transient analysis with multiple reflections/couplings between the networks. Design graphs are summarized and three examples are fabricated, validated, and discussed to demonstrate the design flexibility the proposed method provides.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2268057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6574225/06547164.pdf","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2268057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6574225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Compensation Method for a Marchand Balun With an Arbitrary Connecting Segment Between the Balance Ports","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547164/","displayDocTitle":"General Compensation Method for a Marchand Balun With an Arbitrary Connecting Segment Between the Balance Ports","volume":"61","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13686000","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547164/","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Compensation Method for a Marchand Balun With an Arbitrary Connecting Segment Between the Balance Ports","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ma-2268057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118803S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6574225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6574225","articleId":"6547164","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547173,"authors":[{"name":"Nurul H.

Migrating from the multiport beamforming system to a single-port beamforming system is a promising alternative. In this letter, a novel single-port beamforming algorithm using the pseudo-inverse function is proposed. The signal received at each element is estimated from the combined signal that is generated by the single-port output system. With the estimated values, the array weight is then calculated for the desired radiation pattern. The single-port concept is implemented on a 3-faceted antenna array and simulated in MATLAB. The results show that adaptive beamforming can be achieved with the estimated signals, and this technique has a faster execution time compared to a multiport beamformer. With reduced component count and implementation cost, the proposed technique demonstrates potential for commercial deployment in the mobile communication industry.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2013.2271051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478802","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6478802/06547173.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Port Beamforming Algorithm for 3-Faceted Phased Array Antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547173/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single-Port Beamforming Algorithm for 3-Faceted Phased Array Antenna","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Port Beamforming Algorithm for 3-Faceted Phased Array Antenna","sourcePdf":"lawp-noordin-2271051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076676S","chronDate":"2013","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6478802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6478802","articleId":"6547173","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6547175,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Mill\u00e1n","affiliation":["Departamento de M\u00e9todos Cuantitativos, Universidad Loyola Andaluc\u00eda, Sevilla, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Mill\u00e1n","id":"37540920800"},{"name":"Luis Orihuela","affiliation":["Dpt de Ingenie\u00eda de Sistemas y Autom\u00e1tica.

This letter presents a complete structure and model for propagation in tunnels. Compared to existing models, the complete model unifies different academic viewpoints, reveals all possible propagation mechanisms, and localizes all the dividing points between every two adjacent propagation mechanism zones. When the user is close to the Tx, the propagation is dominated by the free-space mechanism, then the multimode mechanism is established. Afterwards, when the high-order modes have been largely attenuated, the fundamental-mode guided propagation is dominant. Finally, when the user is extremely far away, the waveguide effect vanishes because of attenuation of reflected rays. Measurements and simulations validate the model.

A three-level inverter has an outstanding performance and is advantageous in the switching device selection than a two-level inverter. In the transformerless PV systems using the three-level inverter, the PV systems should suffer from the leakage current and generate the neutral-point voltage unbalance. To solve two problems, this paper proposes modulation techniques to reduce the leakage current and balance the dc-link voltages. The cause of the leakage current in the three-level inverter is analyzed. The proposed technique LMZVM using the large, medium, and zero vectors reduces the common mode voltage that causes the leakage current than that of the conventional PWM. Moreover, the proposed technique LMSVM using the large, medium, and small vectors balances the dc-link voltages with reduced CMV as the same in LMZVM. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is verified by comparing its results with those of the convectional PWM. The results are obtained through simulations and experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547188/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13843297","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6547188/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Modulation Techniques for a Leakage Current Reduction and a Neutral-Point Voltage Balance in Transformerless Photovoltaic Systems Using a Three-Level Inverter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Modulation Techniques for a Leakage Current Reduction and a Neutral-Point Voltage Balance in Transformerless Photovoltaic Systems Using a Three-Level Inverter","sourcePdf":"tpel-lee-2264954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079342S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6547188","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":6547194,"authors":[{"name":"Jungong Han","affiliation":["Civolution, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6595583/6547194/6547194-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jungong Han (M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication and information system from Xidian University, Shaanxi, China, in 2004.","While pursuing the Ph.D. degree, he spent one year at the Internet Media Group, Microsoft Research Asia, China.

The counter-based controller can reduce power consumption in the digital circuitry by 30%.

This technique will be used for experiments that observe coherent radio emission from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These experiments are designed to make a detailed study of the development of the electromagnetic part of air showers. Therefore, these radio signals provide information that is complementary to that obtained by water-Cherenkov detectors which are predominantly sensitive to the particle content of an air shower at ground. The radio signals from air showers are caused by the coherent emission due to geomagnetic and charge-excess processes. These emissions can be observed in the frequency band between 10-100 MHz. However, this frequency range is significantly contaminated by narrow-band RFI and other human-made distortions. A FIR filter implemented in the FPGA logic segment of the front-end electronics of a radio sensor significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we discuss an adaptive filter which is based on linear prediction. The coefficients for the linear predictor (LP) are dynamically refreshed and calculated in the embedded NIOS processor, which is implemented in the same FPGA chip. The Levinson recursion, used to obtain the filter coefficients, is also implemented in the NIOS and is partially supported by direct multiplication in the DSP blocks of the logic FPGA segment. Tests confirm that the LP can be an alternative to other methods involving multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure. These multiple conversions draw heavily on the power consumption of the FPGA and are avoided by the linear prediction approach. Minimization of the power consumption is an important issue because the final system will be powered by solar panels. The FIR filter has been successfully tested in the Altera development kits with the EP4CE115F29C7 from the Cyclone IV family and the EP3C120F780C7 from the Cyclone III family at a 170 MHz sampling rate, a 12-bit I/O resolution, and an internal 30-bit dynamic range. Most of the slow floating-point NIOS calculations have been moved to the FPGA logic segments as extended fixed-point operations, which significantly reduced the refreshing time of the coefficients used in the LP. We conclude that the LP is a viable alternative to other methods such as non-adaptive methods involving digital notch filters or multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2013.2264726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/6626360/06547205.pdf","startPage":"3483","endPage":"3490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2013.2264726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6626360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA/NIOS Implementation of an Adaptive FIR Filter Using Linear Prediction to Reduce Narrow-Band RFI for Radio Detection of Cosmic Rays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547205/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA/NIOS Implementation of an Adaptive FIR Filter Using Linear Prediction to Reduce Narrow-Band RFI for Radio Detection of Cosmic Rays","volume":"60","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13810470","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547205/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA/NIOS Implementation of an Adaptive FIR Filter Using Linear Prediction to Reduce Narrow-Band RFI for Radio Detection of Cosmic Rays","sourcePdf":"tns-szadkowski-2264726-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069669S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6626360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6626360","articleId":"6547205","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6547207,"authors":[{"name":"Wanchen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wanchen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37071058900"},{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37080732000"},{"name":"Wenquan Che","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenquan","lastName":"Che","id":"37284442800"},{"name":"Jingjing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37071796400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6547207","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2645},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, a new edge-fed patch antenna element using artificial magnetic conductor structures (AMCs) is proposed.

This is an important property of the device for operation in inductive switching environments. Critical electric field and mobility parameters for epitaxial GaN layers grown on bulk GaN are extracted from electrical measurements. The reverse recovery time of the vertical GaN p-n diode is not discernible because it is limited by capacitance rather than minority carrier storage, and because of this its switching performance exceeds the highest speed silicon diode.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2266664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/6605590/06547215.pdf","startPage":"3067","endPage":"3070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2013.2266664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Voltage Vertical GaN p-n Diodes With Avalanche Capability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547215/","displayDocTitle":"High Voltage Vertical GaN p-n Diodes With Avalanche Capability","volume":"60","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13794817","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547215/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Voltage Vertical GaN p-n Diodes With Avalanche Capability","sourcePdf":"ted-kizilyalli-2266664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057954S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6605590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6605590","articleId":"6547215","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547227,"authors":[{"name":"Till Boller","affiliation":["Vossloh Kiepe Main Line Technology GmbH, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6714460/6547227/6547227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Till Boller was born in Hilden, Germany, in 1981.

In this framework, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures seem to offer valid solutions since they allow powerful measurement algorithms to be implemented on low-cost hardware with reconfigurable firmware. This paper proposes a FPGA-based measurement instrument for harmonic and interharmonic monitoring in compliance with the most important PQ standards. Key feature of the proposed instrument is the very low requirements of hardware and firmware FPGA resources, thus making it suitable for applications that require cost-effective measurements. The proposed instrument shows performance comparable with one of the powerful and more expensive measurement solutions available on the market. In particular, despite the absence of a sampling frequency synchronization system, the proposed instrument proves to be compliant with IEC 61000-4-30, even in the presence of huge frequency deviations. After a description of the proposed hardware and firmware solutions, the experimental characterization of the proposed instrument in emulated and real environments is

In this paper, a column-parallel 11-bit two-step quantization scheme is proposed. It consists of a 3-bit single-slope analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and an 8-bit successive approximation register (SAR) ADC. The power consumption of the column-parallel circuitry is significantly reduced when compared with the traditional single-slope ADC and other low-power ADC schemes because smaller SAR ADC reference voltages are selected after quantizing the first three most significant bits. In addition, as only an 8-bit SAR ADC is required in the proposed quantization scheme, the capacitor array matching can be greatly relaxed compared with an 11-bit SAR ADC thus, resulting in noncalibration feature. A 1200 \u00d7 800 pixel resolution color CMOS image sensor (CIS) is fabricated using TSMC 0.18-\u03bcm CIS technology. The measurement result shows that the total power consumption figure-of-merit of this research is only 1.33 mW/megapixel/frame under 3.3-V (analog)/1.8-V (digital) power supply.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6564406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/6564406/06547236.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2268207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2013.2268207","startPage":"2561","endPage":"2566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power CMOS Image Sensor Based on Column-Parallel Single-Slope/SAR Quantization Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547236/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power CMOS Image Sensor Based on Column-Parallel Single-Slope/SAR Quantization Scheme","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547236/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"13694085","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power CMOS Image Sensor Based on Column-Parallel Single-Slope/SAR Quantization Scheme","sourcePdf":"ted-tang-2268207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077724S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6564406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6564406","articleId":"6547236","onlineDate":"25 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547305,"authors":[{"name":"Xingjie Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"lastName":"Xingjie Wei","id":"37070257800"},{"name":"Chang-Tsun Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"lastName":"Chang-Tsun Li","id":"37278180500"},{"name":"Yongjian Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"lastName":"Yongjian Hu","id":"37277449400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4989-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4987-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4988-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6547305","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"abstract":"Face recognition (FR) systems in real environment need to deal with uncontrolled variations in face images such as occlusions and disguise. Most of the current FR algorithms do not consider the fact that occlusions may exist in both reference and query images. In this paper, we summarise three occlusion cases that a realistic FR system should take account of. We present a novel non-parametric classification method to handle the occlusion related problems. Our method represents a face image as a sub-patch sequence which maintains the inherent structure information of the face. Matching is based on the Image-to-Class distance from a query sequence to all reference sequences of an enrolled class. Experimental results on public databases verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6532128/6547298/06547305.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF)","doi":"10.1109/IWBF.2013.6547305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWBF.2013.6547305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust face recognition with occlusions in both reference and query images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Face","Face recognition","Databases","Image reconstruction","Training","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","hidden feature removal","image classification","image matching","image representation","image sequences","nonparametric statistics","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","occlusion","query image","reference image","uncontrolled face image variation","FR algorithm","nonparametric classification method","face image representation","sub-patch sequence","image matching","image-to-class distance","query sequence","reference sequence","public database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Biometrics","Occlusion","Image-to-Class distance","Dynamic Time Warping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust face recognition with occlusions in both reference and query images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547305/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13612538","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"4-5 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust face recognition with occlusions in both reference and query images","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"ROBUSTFACERECOGNITIONWITHOCCLUSIONSINBOTHREFE.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049192S","chronDate":"4-5 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6532128","isNumber":"6547298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6532128","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6547298","articleId":"6547305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547317,"authors":[{"name":"Mihails Pudzs","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science (IECS), Riga, LV, Latvia"],"firstName":"Mihails","lastName":"Pudzs","id":"37567477300"},{"name":"Rihards Fuksis","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science (IECS), Riga, LV, Latvia"],"firstName":"Rihards","lastName":"Fuksis","id":"37567474400"},{"name":"Modris Greitans","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science (IECS), Riga, LV, Latvia"],"firstName":"Modris","lastName":"Greitans","id":"37568146100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4989-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4987-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4988-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6547317","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547317","abstract":"Palmprint is widely used biometric feature in biometric and forensic applications, however it is still a challenging task to process the images and extract the useful data, because the evidence, left at the crime scenes, are usually deformed and distorted by artifacts. Palmprint contains different types of visible features that can be used for identification of criminals, including big details, like crease, ridge flow, and small details, like ridges, valleys and minutiae points. In this paper we focus on ridge extraction task. We demonstrate how integration of angular preference to an existing algorithm (Non-Halo Complex Matched Filtering, NH-CMF) may significantly improve quality of extracted features. We introduce the approach where NH-CMF and automated analysis of magnitude weighted angle histogram are used for ridge pattern extraction and noise reduction. Extracted information may support or even automate ridge routing that is necessary for palmprint feature extraction in forensics.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Feature extraction","Kernel","Forensics","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","filtering theory","image denoising","image forensics","palmprint recognition","police data processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["palmprint image processing","nonhalo complex matched filter","forensic data analysis","biometric feature","biometric application","forensic application","image processing","crime scene","visible feature","ridge extraction task","angular preference","magnitude weighted angle histogram","noise reduction","palmprint feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Palmprints","forensics","image processing","CMF","NH-CMF"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWBF.2013.6547317","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6532128/6547298/06547317.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IWBF.2013.6547317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Palmprint image processing with Non-Halo Complex Matched Filters for forensic data analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Palmprint image processing with Non-Halo Complex Matched Filters for forensic data analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13612550","publicationDate":"April 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-5 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547317/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Palmprint image processing with Non-Halo Complex Matched Filters for forensic data analysis","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PALMPRINTIMAGEPROCESSINGWITHNONHALOCOMPLEXMAT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065612S","chronDate":"4-5 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6532128","isNumber":"6547298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6532128","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6547298","articleId":"6547317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6547433,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Clifton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Clifton","id":"37279376000"},{"name":"Tamir Tassa","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The Open University, Ra'anana, Israel"],"firstName":"Tamir","lastName":"Tassa","id":"37681651600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5304-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5303-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5302-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6547433","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":853},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547433","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Data privacy","Syntactics","Publishing","Data models","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential privacy","private data analysis","syntactic anonymity models","privacy preserving data mining"]}],"abstract":"Recently, there has been a growing debate over approaches for handling and analyzing private data.

All the MOSFETs are replaced by the floating gate MOSFETs to make the OTRA design programmable. The charge at the floating gate can be programmed after fabrication, based on Hot-e-injection and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling techniques. This programming charge at floating gate results in threshold voltage variation in these MOSFETs, which in turn can modify circuit's specifications. The high frequency small signal analysis of the design is prepared and specifications of the design are re-derived in terms of threshold voltages of the MOSFETs. The expressions of output voltage, transresistance, input impedance, output impedance and offsets are derived in terms of threshold voltages of respective MOSFETs. In order to achieve circuits AC and DC characteristics, the circuit is simulated using BSIM3 level49 MOSFET models in T-spice 0.35um CMOS process.

With IDMA, interleavers are the only means of user separation. In Discrete Fourier Transform based OFDM-IDMA systems, signals only overlap in the frequency domain while the Wavelet Transform signals overlap both in the time and frequency domains, so there is no need for the cyclic prefix (CP) in the proposed model. Performance of the proposed model is experimented and compared for different BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM channel with transmitter & receivers and observed better BER. Also compared for different wavelet families and found the suitable with Daubechie wavelet. The proposed model Comparisons with other alternative technologies such as DFT-OFDM-IDMA is provided. The proposed model is discussed for multi-user detection, flexible rate adaptation, frequency diversity, and significant advantages regarding spectral and power efficiency. This paper concludes with efficient performance of the system which can be considerable for next wireless communication system.","doi":"10.1109/SCES.2013.6547503","publicationTitle":"2013 Students Conference on Engineering and Systems (SCES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Students Conference on Engineering and Systems (SCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530990/6547477/06547503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCES.2013.6547503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform based OFDM-IDMA system with AWGN channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547503/","displayDocTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform based OFDM-IDMA system with AWGN channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13613194","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547503/","conferenceDate":"12-14 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete wavelet transform based OFDM-IDMA system with AWGN channel","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048054S","chronDate":"12-14 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530990","isNumber":"6547477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530990","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6547477","articleId":"6547503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6547505,"authors":[{"name":"Samresh Satapathy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, INDIA"],"firstName":"Samresh","lastName":"Satapathy","id":"37086791899"},{"name":"K Mahesh Dash","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, INDIA"],"firstName":"K Mahesh","lastName":"Dash","id":"37939003100"},{"name":"B.

Based on previous work, a novel design of these systems is studied for multipath Rayleigh fading channel by using minimum mean square error equalization.

When users reside near the boundary of a cellular cell, downlink data rate reduces to a very low value. This new approach is based on four different techniques which are cooperative MIMO, 64 QAM, adaptive relay networking, and high speed downlink protocols in cellular region. In MIMO transmission, minimum two antennas are required each at the base station and user entity to enhance the performance of HSDPA. This paper mainly focuses on cooperative communication in cellular network through multi-hop networking, which allows peak data rate up to 42 mbps, theoretically. Optimum utilization of cooperative MIMO will ultimately lead to the next revolutionary wireless technology, which can increase reliability of high speed network in shadow areas and dead zones.

In this paper, a P&O method MPPT charge controller is designed and it is converted into digital domain to use in FPGA. Compared to analog controllers, digital controller offers more advantages like high accuracy, less effected by noise etc., MPPT charge controller is designed to perform 1) to convert the variable DC electrical energy which is coming from solar into fixed DC and 2) to track the maximum power from the solar PV module under all operating conditions.

The op-amp is a differential amplifier (DA), allow us to not only amplify very small signals of sensor but also to add or subtract offset voltages and to electrically isolate (buffer) sensors from the rest of system. In this paper, we present the amplification of Yokto level signal (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-24</sup>\nV) to the saturation level of op-amp with the help of cascaded structure of INA. We can say, this is the cascaded INA. This structure of INA with order five, amplifies the signal level up to 490dB at normal condition of components. But at the critical values of all the components, the gain will be improved by approximately 630dB [1]. The gain level is also increased with increment in the order of the INA. Practically, due to the offset voltage, very high gain and number of stages; cascaded INA gives the +ve or -ve saturation or clipped output voltage. Therefore, In this paper, we presents the modified structure of cascaded INA for the reduction of output offset voltage and cascaded INA efficiently works.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCES.2013.6547579","publicationTitle":"2013 Students Conference on Engineering and Systems (SCES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Students Conference on Engineering and Systems (SCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530990/6547477/06547579.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/SCES.2013.6547579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC offset voltage reduction in cascaded instrumentation amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"DC offset voltage reduction in cascaded instrumentation amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547579/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13613270","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547579/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC offset voltage reduction in cascaded instrumentation amplifier","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043136S","chronDate":"12-14 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530990","isNumber":"6547477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530990","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6547477","articleId":"6547579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6547630,"authors":[{"name":"Xindong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Vermont"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6674933/6547630/6547630-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xindong Wu received the bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the Hefei University of Technology, China, and the PhD degree in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, Britain.

In clinical environment during electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, several artifacts encounter and mask tiny features underlying brain wave activity. Especially in remote clinical monitoring, low computational complexity filters are desirable. Hence, in our paper, we propose various efficient and computationally simple adaptive noise cancelers for EEG enhancement. These schemes mostly employ simple addition and shift operations, and achieve considerable speed over the other conventional realizations. We have tested the proposed implementations on real brain waves recorded using emotive EEG system. Our experiments show that the proposed realization gives better performance compared with existing realizations in terms of signal to noise ratio, computational complexity, convergence rate, excess mean square error, misadjustment, and coherence.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2271042","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","startPage":"3276","endPage":"3283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6572817/06547653.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2271042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6572817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Signal Conditioning Techniques for Brain Activity in Remote Health Monitoring Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Computational complexity","Convergence","Brain","Monitoring","Biomedical telemetry","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","digital filters","electroencephalography","medical signal processing","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal conditioning techniques","brain activity","remote health monitoring network","signal conditioning algorithms","brain signal enhancement","remote healthcare monitoring applications","clinical environment","electroencephalogram recording","EEG recording","brain wave activity","remote clinical monitoring","low computational complexity filters","adaptive noise cancelers","EEG enhancement","signal-noise ratio","convergence rate","excess mean square error","misadjustment","coherence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive noise cancelers","artifact","brain wave","signal conditioning","remote health monitoring","LMF algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Signal Conditioning Techniques for Brain Activity in Remote Health Monitoring Network","volume":"13","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13680958","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547653/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547653/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Signal Conditioning Techniques for Brain Activity in Remote Health Monitoring Network","sourcePdf":"jsen-shaik-2271042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095284S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6572817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6572817","articleId":"6547653","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547655,"authors":[{"name":"John G.

Two-axis actively regulated bearingless motors have the advantages of low cost and compactness; however, only two degrees of freedom are actively regulated in the radial x - y directions, thus a tilting motion sometimes causes serious interference resulting to instability. The interference occurs in non-collocated structure. In this paper, novel mathematical analysis is carried out and a block diagram including the interference is presented. It is also shown that stable suspension can be successfully realized by means of adjustments of an integral gain.

As an effective service aggregation methodology, workflow technology has been used to construct composite services. Efficient and dependable workflow scheduling (WFS) is crucial for integrating enterprise systems. While WFS has been widely studied, WFS-related algorithms are mainly focused on optimizing execution time or cost. However, in cloud computing environment, WFS is up against the threats of the inherent uncertainty and unreliability to the applications. Therefore, trust service-oriented strategies must be considered in WFS. As a result, this paper proposes a trust service-oriented workflow scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm adopts a trust metric that combines direct trust and recommendation trust. In addition, we provide balance policies to enable users to balance different requirements, including time, cost, and trust. A case study was conducted to illustrate the value of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and feasible.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/6881767/06547674.pdf","startPage":"868","endPage":"878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6881767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Trust Service-Oriented Scheduling Model for Workflow Applications in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547674/","displayDocTitle":"A Trust Service-Oriented Scheduling Model for Workflow Applications in Cloud Computing","volume":"8","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547674/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14548125","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"60874120, 61272036 and 71132008"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"11ZZ188"},{"fundingName":"Changjiang Scholar Program of the Ministry of Education of China"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1044845"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trust Service-Oriented Scheduling Model for Workflow Applications in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"jsyst-tan-2260072-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160563S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6881767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6881767","articleId":"6547674","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6547687,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Amiri Farahani","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6620941/6547687/6547687-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Amiri Farahani (M'10) received the B.Sc.E degree in electrical engineering from the University of Khajeh Nasiredin Toosi, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, the M.Sc.E. degree in electronics from the University of Shahid Beheshti, Tehran, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, in 2012.

The estimator is based on the cross-correlation technique and addresses the problem of sensitivity to noise and parameter initialization observed in other central frequency estimation methods employed with BOTDA sensors. Most of the current estimation methods rely on optimized rigorous least squares or maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithms, which are sensitive to the parameter initialization and noise as they iteratively attempt to minimize the squared error or maximize the matching probability between the model and noisy curve. Alternatively, the estimation made with the cross-correlation based method is more accurate, noniterative, and insensitive to the parameter initialization. This statement is demonstrated and proved by comparing the correlation-based method with two commonly used iterative curve fitting methods based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and MLE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13796909","volume":"13","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6547687/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Detailed Evaluation of the Correlation-Based Method Used for Estimation of the Brillouin Frequency Shift in BOTDA Sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Detailed Evaluation of the Correlation-Based Method Used for Estimation of the Brillouin Frequency Shift in BOTDA Sensors","sourcePdf":"jsen-amirifarahani-2271254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057764S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6620941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6620941","articleId":"6547687","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":6547693,"authors":[{"name":"Evangelos Pikasis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Pikasis","id":"38514804200"},{"name":"Sotiris Karabetsos","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, RDTL Laboratory, Technological Educational Institute of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Sotiris","lastName":"Karabetsos","id":"38239482600"},{"name":"Thomas Nikas","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, RDTL Laboratory, Technological Educational Institute of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Nikas","id":"38234627400"},{"name":"Dimitris Syvridis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Syvridis","id":"37284633100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6547693","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Modulation","Loading","Bit rate","Optical fiber communication","Peak to average power ratio","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete multitone","DMT","DFT-spread","precoded OFDM","MC-CDMA","SI-POF","rate adaptive","bit loading","multicarrier","chow algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, rate-adaptive bit-loading techniques are explored for maximizing the transmission rate of spreading multicarrier modulation schemes over step index plastic optical fiber (SI-POF) short range transmission links.

The analysis is performed in the presence of multiple access interference as the main limiting factor. Throughput analysis for uncoded systems utilizing WOPPM is conducted and a lower bound on the capacity for two types of correlator based receiver structures is derived. Furthermore, for a fixed code and a fixed maximum number of symbols, a numerical solution for maximizing the capacity is presented. Moreover, to minimize the probability of error when the throughput and the number of users are fixed, a numerical solution is introduced. Finally, for two common design problems, algorithms are proposed for achieving the system parameters well close to the optimal settings. The results of our different analyses for uncoded systems using WOPPM have been compared with unwrapped OPPM. Our results have also been compared with on-off keying (OOK) and pulse position modulation (PPM).

Since velocity is essential for depth inversion, we developed an automatic common mid-point (CMP) measurement system, which can work in an ultra-wide band. Envelope velocity spectrum, robust in reflection identification, is used to estimate the dielectric permittivity and layer thickness from CMP datasets. We tested our system on two 50-m-long test lines on a brackish lagoon, i.e., Lake Saroma, in Hokkaido, Japan, in February 2012. The first test line failed due to the existence of a radar-absorbing layer of a mixture of snow and seawater between the snow cover and sea ice. The estimated dielectric permittivity of both snow and ice on the second test line seems to be highly correlated with their surface temperature. Compared with the ground truth, the snow and ice thickness estimations possess a good accuracy, with a respective mean absolute error of about 2 cm (12%) and less than 2 cm (4%), which verifies the accuracy of their dielectric permittivity estimation. Then the estimated two-layer velocity model obtained by interpolation was used to continuously estimate the snow and ice thickness from the common-offset (CO) GPR profile acquired by a commercial GPR system. Our system and method appear capable of accurately measuring the dielectric permittivity and thickness of other layered media.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2266792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6767063/06547715.pdf","startPage":"820","endPage":"827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2266792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of Dielectric Permittivity and Thickness of Snow and Ice on a Brackish Lagoon Using GPR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547715/","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of Dielectric Permittivity and Thickness of Snow and Ice on a Brackish Lagoon Using GPR","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14159282","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547715/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of Dielectric Permittivity and Thickness of Snow and Ice on a Brackish Lagoon Using GPR","sourcePdf":"jstars-liu-2266792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132756S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6767063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6767063","articleId":"6547715","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6547719,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Tuma","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6787012/6547719/6547719-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tomas Tuma (M\u201909) studied computer science in the Department of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, where he received the Bachelor's and Master's degrees (both summa cum laude) in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

The proposed architecture consists of several novel concepts in dealing with issues in sub/near-threshold SRAM including: 1) the differential and data-independent-leakage read port that facilitates robust and faster read operation and alleviates issues in the half-selected cell (pseudo-write) while reducing the area compared to the conventional 8T cell and 2) the various configurations from 14T for a baseline cell to 6.5T for an area-efficient 16-bit cell. These configurations reduce the overall bitcell area and enable low operating voltage. Two memory blocks based on the proposed architecture at the size of 16 and 64 kb, respectively, are fabricated in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS process. The 64 kb prototype has an active area of 0.512 mm2 which is 16% less than that of the conventional 8T-cell-based design. The chip is fully functional for the read operation with 260 mV at 245 kHz and 270 mV for the write operation at 1 MHz.

One class of such devices is all-spin logic (ASL) which is based on switching ferromagnets by spin transfer torque and conduction of spin-polarized current. Using previously developed physics-based circuit models for ASL, we develop a complete logic family for static ASL comprising of majority logic gates. We compare its performance metrics by means of circuit simulations using our Verilog-A compact models. We also show the novel implementations of sequencing elements (e.g., latch and D flip-flop) to enable clocked ASL.

In this paper multi-layer feed forward artificial neural network (MLFFN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) are proposed to implement the online module for power system static security assessment. The security classification, contingency selection and ranking are done based on the composite security index which is capable of accurately differentiating the secure and non-secure cases. For each contingency case as well as for base case condition, the composite security index is computed using the full Newton Raphson load flow analysis. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) models take loading condition and the probable contingencies as the input and assess the system security by screening the credible contingencies and ranking them in the order of severity based on composite security index. The numerical results of applying the proposed approach to IEEE 118-bus test system demonstrate its effectiveness for online power system static security assessment. The comparison of the ANN models with the model based on Newton Raphson load flow analysis in terms of accuracy and computational speed indicate that the proposed model is effective and reliable in the fast evaluation of the security level of power systems. The proposed online static security assessment (OSSA) module realized using the ANN models are found to be suited for online application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Static Security Assessment Module Using Artificial Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2267557","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6627990/06547732.pdf","startPage":"4328","endPage":"4335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2267557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6627990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Online Static Security Assessment Module Using Artificial Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6547732/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13849525","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Static Security Assessment Module Using Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-sunitha-2267557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134598S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6627990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6627990","articleId":"6547732","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547736,"authors":[{"name":"Wha Sook Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6710258/6547736/6547736-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wha Sook Jeon (M'90\u2013SM'01) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1983, 1985, and 1989, respectively.","From 1989 to 1999, she was with the Department of Computer Engineering, Hansung University, Seoul.

With FFR, the frequency band of a macrocell is divided into several frequency partitions (FPs), and the transmission power levels assigned to FPs differ from each other. In this paper, we propose a downlink resource partitioning scheme for two-tier networks, where macrocells adopting FFR are overlaid with the femtocells. With the proposed scheme, every FP is divided into the macro-dedicated, the shared, and the femto-dedicated portions. The ratio of these three portions is different for each FP. We suggest a method to determine a proper ratio of portions in each FP by using an optimization approach.

Exploiting the fact that a conventional SR generates pulses which preserve the input phase information, we take N 1-bit samples of each generated pulse. A suitable choice of the sampling frequency gives as a result a bit vector containing a sub-sampled version of each PSK pulse. Extremely simple digital processing of the vectors from two consecutive pulses allows symbol decision, together with information on signal quality and frequency displacements. Although presented for the QPSK case, the principle may be applied to the M-PSK case with obvious changes. Experimental results on a 20 kbit/s proof-of concept receiver in the 27 MHz band, achieving a sensitivity of -103 dBm, with an FPGA-based implementation of the digital part, validate the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2268313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6704325/06547742.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2268313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Superregenerative QPSK Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547742/","displayDocTitle":"A Superregenerative QPSK Receiver","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14035274","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547742/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Superregenerative QPSK Receiver","sourcePdf":"tcsi-palaschonwalder-2268313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071241S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6704325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6704325","articleId":"6547742","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6547744,"authors":[{"name":"Baris Atakan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, \u00ddzmir Institute of Technology, \u00ddzmir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Baris","lastName":"Atakan","id":"37545692600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6547744","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","mobile radio","signal reconstruction","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling jitter","vehicular sensor networks","vehicular sensor nodes","signal reconstruction","sink node","adaptive communication techniques","energy conservation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy conservation","irregular sampling","sampling jitter","vehicular sensors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547744","abstract":"Vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) are composed of vehicular sensor nodes that collaboratively sample, communicate, and reconstruct the event signal at the sink node.

Specifically, a robust scheme is proposed based on adaptive ensemble decision tree (DT) learning. In offline training, a boosting algorithm is employed to build a classification model as a weighted voting of multiple unpruned small-height DTs. Then, the small-height DTs are periodically updated by incorporating new training cases that account for OC variations or the possible changes of system topology; the voting weights of the small-height DTs are also updated accordingly. In online DSA, the updated classification model is used to map the real-time measurements of the present OC to security classification decisions. The proposed scheme is first illustrated on the IEEE 39-bus test system, and then applied to a regional grid of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system. The results of case studies, using a variety of realized OCs, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in dealing with OC variation and system topology change.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2266617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6627990/06547746.pdf","startPage":"4089","endPage":"4098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2266617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6627990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Online Dynamic Security Assessment Using Adaptive Ensemble Decision-Tree Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547746/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Online Dynamic Security Assessment Using Adaptive Ensemble Decision-Tree Learning","volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13849501","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547746/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Online Dynamic Security Assessment Using Adaptive Ensemble Decision-Tree Learning","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-he-2266617-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102354S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6627990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6627990","articleId":"6547746","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547748,"authors":[{"name":"Jonghong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6803904/6547748/kim-2265314-small.gif","p":["Jonghong Kim (S'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical and information engineering from the Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, Korea, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University, Seoul, in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.","His current research interests include the design and VLSI implementation of error-correction codes."]},"firstName":"Jonghong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37407285800"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6803904/6547748/sung-2265314-small.gif","p":["Wonyong Sung (S'84\u2013M'87\u2013SM'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, in 1987.

Soft-decision error correction algorithms that use multiple-precision sensing for reading memory can solve this problem; however, they require very complex hardware for high-throughput decoding. In this paper, we present a rate-0.96 (68254, 65536) shortened Euclidean geometry low-density parity-check code and its VLSI implementation for high-throughput NAND Flash memory systems. The design employs the normalized a posteriori probability (APP)-based algorithm, serial schedule, and conditional update, which lead to simple functional units, halved decoding iterations, and low-power consumption, respectively. A pipelined-parallel architecture is adopted for high-throughput decoding, and memory-reduction techniques are employed to minimize the chip size. The proposed decoder is implemented in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS technology, and the chip size and energy consumption of the decoder are compared with those of a BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) decoding circuit showing comparable error-correcting performance and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2265314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6803904/06547748.pdf","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2265314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-0.96 LDPC Decoding VLSI for Soft-Decision Error Correction of NAND Flash Memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Rate-0.96 LDPC Decoding VLSI for Soft-Decision Error Correction of NAND Flash Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547748/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14252213","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547748/","volume":"22","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Brain Korea 21 Project and the National Research Foundation of Korea grants funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Korea","grantNumber":"2012R1A2A2A06047297"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-0.96 LDPC Decoding VLSI for Soft-Decision Error Correction of NAND Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sung-2265314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127127S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6803904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6803904","articleId":"6547748","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6547749,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hwan Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Hwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37715827000"},{"name":"Jong-Seob Baek","affiliation":["Team of Advanced Technology and System, Convergence Research Center, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Seob","lastName":"Baek","id":"37288653000"},{"name":"Jae-Shin Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Shin","lastName":"Han","id":"38548815800"},{"name":"Jong-Soo Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Soo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292426500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6547749","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547749","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel coding","channel estimation","fading channels","Hadamard codes","least squares approximations","mean square error methods","orthogonal codes","precoding","relay networks (telecommunication)","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended orthogonal codes","amplify-and-forward multiple relay networks","frequency selective fading channels","least squares channel estimation","channel impulse response","CIR","Chu sequences","signed identity precoding","Hadamard codes","mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying","channel estimation","frequency-selective fading channel","multiple relay"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present the efficient channel estimation scheme for amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-relay networks in frequency-selective fading channels. It is first addressed that a known sequence transmitted from a source must have a perfect correlation property to achieve a minimum channel estimation error, particularly in the least squares (LS) sense. The known sequences retransmitted from the multiple relay must have to be decoupled at the destination to completely estimate the channel impulse responses (CIRs) between multiple links. To satisfy such requirements, we then propose a repeated known sequence consisting of Chu sequences at a source and a signed identity precoding using extended orthogonal codes, i.e., Hadamard codes, at relays. Moreover, we investigate various properties of the proposed channel estimations through the analysis of mean square error (MSE).","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6710258/06547749.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"423","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2271284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2271284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimations Using Extended Orthogonal Codes for AF Multiple-Relay Networks Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimations Using Extended Orthogonal Codes for AF Multiple-Relay Networks Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","htmlLink":"/document/6547749/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14031719","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimations Using Extended Orthogonal Codes for AF Multiple-Relay Networks Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-baek-2271284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083085S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6710258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6710258","articleId":"6547749","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6547753,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Maione","affiliation":["Diparitmento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dell'Informazione, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Maione","id":"37326926900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-3357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-3365"}],"articleNumber":"6547753","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency response","Biological system modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Numerical stability","Indexes","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","convergence","digital integrated circuits","function approximation","polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form rational approximations","digital differentiators-integrators","analog differentiators-integrators","fractional differentiators-integrators","convergent coefficients","continued fraction expansions","CFE","approximating fractional operators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog and discrete fractional-order operators","approximation","continued fractions","fractional-order controllers","realization of noninteger order circuits and systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides closed-form formulas for coefficients of convergents of some popular continued fraction expansions (CFEs) approximating s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03bd</sup>\n, with , and (2/T)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03bd</sup>\n((z-1)/(z+1))\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03bd</sup>\n.

The main merit is that its resonant circuit has high stability and simplicity, resulting from the employment of the stray inductance distributed in the circuit as a collective resonant inductor. Accordingly, the current spike during switching operation is removed due to zero-current-switching (ZCS) realization. Another distinct merit is that the proposed converter features symmetric construction. With this kind of construction, the voltage ripple of charge/pump capacitors can be cancelled out with each other and then output voltage ripple will be largely reduced. Thus, it is unnecessary to use a bulky capacitor to reduce output voltage ripple. Compared with conventional SCCs, at the same conversion ratio, the BMSCC with symmetric construction requires fewer switches and capacitors with lower voltage stress, so as to cut the size and cost and promote the power destiny further. It is also noteworthy that the symmetric construction character assures that the two symmetric parts can work independently under a simplified control strategy. In addition, the modular configuration contributes to convenient voltage extension conveniently. The simulation and experimental results of a 100\u00a0W prototype with a voltage conversion ratio of eight validate the principle and features of this topology.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2270136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2270136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632912","startPage":"1881","endPage":"1893","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6632912/06547757.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547757","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant power convertors","switching convertors","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topology","voltage conversion ratio","voltage extension","modular configuration","control strategy","symmetric construction character","power destiny","voltage stress","conventional SCC","bulky capacitor","pump capacitors","charge capacitors","ZCS realization","zero-current-switching realization","switching operation","resonant inductor","stray inductance","resonant circuit","BMSCC","output voltage ripple","enhanced efficiency","quasi-resonant bridge modular switched-capacitor converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular configuration","output voltage ripple","switched-capacitor converter (SCC)","zero-current-switching (ZCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Quasi-Resonant Bridge Modular Switched-Capacitor Converter With Enhanced Efficiency and Reduced Output Voltage Ripple","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13843306","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547757/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547757/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Quasi-Resonant Bridge Modular Switched-Capacitor Converter With Enhanced Efficiency and Reduced Output Voltage Ripple","sourcePdf":"tpel-he-2270136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062251S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6547757","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6547759,"authors":[{"name":"Amer Samarah","affiliation":["Edward S.

Intercell interference is modeled as a function not only of the cross correlations between spreading codes but of the radio propagation conditions and traffic distributions as well. The cross correlation of spreading codes is analyzed, and the concept of the scrambling code family is proposed to simplify the code planning process. The proposed algorithm facilitates the assignment and selection of scrambling codes. Numerical results shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve a much lower intercell interference than the existing SCP algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6710258/06547765.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2271262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2271262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scrambling Code Planning in TD-SCDMA Cellular Systems","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TD-SCDMA cellular system","time-division synchronous code-division multiple-access system","spreading code","cell-specific scrambling code planning","SCP algorithm","radio propagation","traffic distribution","code planning process","intercell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intercell interference","scrambling code family","scrambling code planning (SCP)","time-division synchronous code-division multiple access (TD-SCDMA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Scrambling Code Planning in TD-SCDMA Cellular Systems","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6547765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14031685","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scrambling Code Planning in TD-SCDMA Cellular Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2271262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058761S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6710258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6710258","articleId":"6547765","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6547767,"authors":[{"name":"Ulf Schmid","affiliation":["Department of T/R modules and MMICs, Cassidian, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6574231/6547767/6547767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ulf Schmid received the Dipl.-Ing. degree and Dr.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany, in 2001 and 2010, respectively.","From 2002 to 2006, he was a Research Assistant with the Institute of Microwave Techniques, University of Ulm, where his research interest was in the field of planar low-loss antennas for communication and automotive radar applications.

Two inverters, with the SiC and Si transistors, respectively, are built using the same circuit layout and investigated accordingly. Their conducted EMI levels are compared under the conditions of without filter and with traditional common mode (CM) filters. Reasons of the exhibited different noise emissions are analyzed. To verify the discussions, two inverters are tested in the CM. This allows for the identification and analysis of their maximized CM and differential mode (DM) wave shapes. It is shown that the excited parasitic oscillations during the switching transients are magnified more in the SiC JFET inverter, which is the main cause of the noise difference. Lastly, improved filtering solutions are proposed, which effectively suppressed the increased high-frequency noise due to the faster SiC switching speed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison and Reduction of Conducted EMI in SiC JFET and Si IGBT-Based Motor Drives","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2271301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6632912/06547771.pdf","startPage":"1757","endPage":"1767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2271301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Comparison and Reduction of Conducted EMI in SiC JFET and Si IGBT-Based Motor Drives","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6547771/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13843331","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison and Reduction of Conducted EMI in SiC JFET and Si IGBT-Based Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-gong-2271301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103619S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6547771","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6547776,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hamid","affiliation":["Radio Communication Systems Group, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6623150/6547776/6547776-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Hamid (S'10) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Khartoum University, Khartoum, Sudan, in 2005, the M.Sc. degree from the Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden, in 2009, and the degree of Licentiate in technology from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2013.

The presented technique uses the knowledge of the noise uncertainty and a probabilistic validation to overcome the limitations of the discriminant analysis. A comparative study between the proposed technique and the maximum-minimum eigenvalue detection has been performed based on two performance metrics: the probability of false alarm and the probability of detection. The spectrum discriminator has been further developed to a peel-off technique where all primary users can be detected. The performance of the spectrum discriminator and the peel-off technique has been tested on simulations and experimentally verified. The comparative study is based on simulations as well as measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13810376","htmlLink":"/document/6547776/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios Using Discriminant Analysis: A Novel Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios Using Discriminant Analysis: A Novel Approach","sourcePdf":"tim-hamid-2267456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091441S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6623150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6623150","articleId":"6547776","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6547811,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6547811/6547811-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Zhai (S'12) received the B.

Based on two-path successive relaying and decode-and-forward protocols, each cognitive user intelligently switches the spectrum leasing protocol to cooperate in the primary data transmission. As a reward, the spectrum is then leased to the cognitive user for its own data transmission. For given m cognitive users, the best one that can achieve the largest secondary rate while satisfying primary rate target is scheduled for the spectrum leasing. It is shown that the cooperative diversity gain of m+1 is achieved for the primary system and the selection diversity gain of m is obtained for the secondary system. Moreover, multiuser diversity of secondary system is studied and the throughput scales as log(log m) when m is large. Performance results are provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed adaptive spectrum leasing scheme compared with the decode-and-forward based scheme and two-path successive relaying based scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061713.121564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","startPage":"3388","endPage":"3398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06547811.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Spectrum Leasing with Secondary User Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547811/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Spectrum Leasing with Secondary User Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674038","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Spectrum Leasing with Secondary User Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3388-tw1307-zhai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08221S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6547811","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547812,"authors":[{"name":"Salama S.

Subsequently, the cumulative distribution function (CDF), probability density function (PDF) and moment generating function (MGF) of the effective SINR are determined based on the upper-bound. Expressions for the error probabilities in both conventional and opportunistic relaying are derived utilizing the statistical characterization of the effective SINR. We also derive an approximate PDF of the equivalent instantaneous SINR at the destination. This leads to a simple and general asymptotic error probability expression which facilitates better insight into the effect of different system parameters on the error probability. Furthermore, we investigate the problem of optimum resource allocation in the network aiming at improving performance in the presence of resource constraints.

This paper presents a blind SLM scheme based on a decision metric obtained from pilot sub-channel responses. A novel SI detection method enabling low complexity data decoding is proposed. The SI is detected by exploiting the high autocorrelation between adjacent pilot sub-channel responses. The SI detection error rate is analytically derived and compared with that obtained by simulations. Simulation results of the data decoding scheme based on the proposed SI detection method show the bit error rate performance comparable to that of the simplified maximum likelihood (ML) data decoding scheme, while the computational complexity is close to that of the embedded SI based decoding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.061713.120280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06547813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.061713.120280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","startPage":"3140","endPage":"3147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-Aided Side Information Detection in SLM-Based OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-Aided Side Information Detection in SLM-Based OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13679330","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547813/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-Aided Side Information Detection in SLM-Based OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"3140-tw1307-hong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09044S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6547813","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547815,"authors":[{"name":"Ralf Bendlin","affiliation":["Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6547815/6547815-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ralf Bendlin (M'07) received his preliminary diploma from the Darmstadt University of Technology in Darmstadt, Germany in 2003.

Since scheduling changes the spatial transmit signal processing with each time slot, information from neighboring base stations is required for data encoding. This can, in theory, be accomplished by a high-capacity backhaul network through which the base stations exchange channel state information (CSI) and other control signals. In reality, however, the temporal granularity of the scheduler does not allow for timely distribution of CSI among base stations. We propose a two-phase scheduler which optimizes the precoding in the first phase and allows the users to feed back their instantaneous interference power in the second phase. For the single-user case, we present a practical scheme that combines two-phase scheduling with precoders that maximize the signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. If the users feed back the interference power together with a supported rate, communication between base stations can be limited to integers. By comparing the performance to multi-user two-phase scheduling with dirty paper coding and to algorithms that share CSI among base stations we show that two-phase scheduling is a technically and practically feasible solution to deal with non-stationary intercell interference.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06547815.pdf","startPage":"3148","endPage":"3157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.061413.120320","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.061413.120320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547815","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","OFDM","Interference","Vectors","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","codecs","data communication","interference (signal)","precoding","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-phase scheduling","leakage-based precoding","wireless cellular networks","downlink","base stations","multiple antennas","scheduling changes","spatial transmit signal processing","neighboring base stations","data encoding","high-capacity backhaul network","base stations exchange channel state information","CSI","control signals","temporal granularity","scheduler","two-phase scheduler","precoders","signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio","multiuser two-phase scheduling","nonstationary intercell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular networks","interference channel (IFC)","coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission","base station cooperation","intercell interference coordination (ICIC)","non-stationary interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Two-Phase Scheduling and Leakage-Based Precoding in Wireless Cellular Networks","accessionNumber":"13674039","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547815/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Phase Scheduling and Leakage-Based Precoding in Wireless Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"3148-tw1307-ralf.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150494S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6547815","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6547816,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyang Pei","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Connexis, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6547816/6547816-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiyang Pei (S'09-M'12) received her B.E. degree and PhD degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.

In this paper, we consider a scenario of D2D communications overlaying a cellular network and propose a new spectrum sharing protocol, which allows the D2D users to communicate bi-directionally with each other while assisting the two-way communications between the cellular base station (BS) and the cellular user (CU). We derive the achievable rate region of the sum rate of the D2D transmissions versus that of the cellular transmissions. The Pareto boundary of the region is found by optimizing the transmit power at BS and CU as well as the power splitting factor at the relay D2D node. Since either of the two D2D users can be the relay and there can exist multiple pairs of D2D users, we also consider the relay selection from the potential D2D users. We find through numerical results that the proposed two-way protocol with power control at the BS and CU is effective to improve the sum rate for both the D2D and cellular users. In addition, relay selection can achieve further improvement in the sum rate of the cellular links.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.061713.121956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06547816.pdf","startPage":"3611","endPage":"3621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.061713.121956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications Overlaying Two-Way Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications Overlaying Two-Way Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547816/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13679332","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547816/","volume":"12","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications Overlaying Two-Way Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"3611-tw1307-pei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086701S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6547816","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6547817,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Y.S.

It has been widely studied recently and one important problem in this new paradigm is the allocation of radio spectrum to secondary users effectively in the presence of primary users. We call it the cognitive radio spectrum allocation problem (CRSAP) in this paper. In the conventional problem formulation, a secondary user can be either on or off and its interference range becomes maximum or zero, respectively. We first develop a solution to CRSAP based on the newly proposed chemical reaction-inspired metaheuristic called Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO). We study different utility functions, accounting for utilization and fairness, with the consideration of the hardware constraint, and compare the performance of our proposed CRO-based algorithm with existing ones. Simulation results show that the CRO-based algorithm always outperforms the others dramatically. Next, by allowing adjustable transmission power, we propose power-controlled CRSAP (PC-CRSAP), a new formulation to the problem with the consideration of spatial diversity. We design a two-phase algorithm to solve PC-CRSAP, and again simulation results show excellent performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.061713.120255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","startPage":"3180","endPage":"3190","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06547817.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Controlled Cognitive Radio Spectrum Allocation with Chemical Reaction Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547817/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power-Controlled Cognitive Radio Spectrum Allocation with Chemical Reaction Optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13679333","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Controlled Cognitive Radio Spectrum Allocation with Chemical Reaction Optimization","sourcePdf":"3180-tw1307-lam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066517S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6547817","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":6547818,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed W.

In bi-directional relay networks, communication is performed over two phases: the broadcasting phase, and the cooperation phase. In the broadcasting phase, both source nodes broadcast their signals simultaneously to the N relay nodes, while in the cooperation phase, transmission is based on one of two modes: (1) time-division (TD), or (2) multiple-access (MA). In the TD-BD-AF scheme, each relay node is allocated a time-slot to transmit its processed signal, while in the MA-BD-AF scheme, all the N relay nodes simultaneously transmit network-coded signals to both source nodes, in a single time-slot. Moreover, a suboptimal relay selection (i.e. SRS-BD-AF) that approximately maximizes the sum-of-rates is proposed. Optimal and suboptimal sum-of-rates maximizing power allocations are studied under the TD-BD-AF and MA-BD-AF schemes, respectively, where it is shown that the MA-BD-AF scheme reduces to the SRS-BD-AF scheme. Symbol error rate performance analysis is provided, where it is shown that both the TD-BD-AF and SRS-BD-AF schemes achieve full diversity. Imperfect timing synchronization is analyzed and it is demonstrated that the SRS-BD-AF outperforms the other schemes in terms of the achievable rate. Simulation results are provided to complement the theoretical analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bidirectional control","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Synchronization","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","network coding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward cooperative networks","network-coded bi-directional amplify-and-forward relaying","broadcasting phase","cooperation phase","source nodes","relay nodes","time-division","multiple-access","TD-BD-AF scheme","MA-BD-AF scheme","suboptimal relay selection","symbol error rate performance analysis","imperfect timing synchronization","SRS-BD-AF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","bi-directional","cooperation","network coding","power allocation","relay selection","timing synchronization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061713.121107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06547818.pdf","startPage":"3238","endPage":"3252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061713.121107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Coded Bi-Directional Relaying for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks: A Comparative Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network-Coded Bi-Directional Relaying for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks: A Comparative Study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547818/","volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547818/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13674040","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Coded Bi-Directional Relaying for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks: A Comparative Study","sourcePdf":"3238-tw1307-baidas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086002S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6547818","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547819,"authors":[{"name":"Peter He","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6571302/6547819/6547819-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter He received the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2009.

Unlike the conventional water-filling (CWF) algorithm, we eliminate the step to find the water level through solving a non-linear system from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the target problem. The proposed GWF requires less computation than the CWF algorithm, under the same memory requirement and sorted parameters. Furthermore, the proposed GWF avoids complicated derivation, such as derivative or gradient operations in conventional optimization methods, while provides insights to the problems and the exact solutions to the target problems. Most importantly, the GWF can be extended to solve a generalized form of radio resource allocation problem with more stringent constraints: (weighted) optimization problem with individual peak power constraints (GWFPP), and to include (weighted) group bounded power constraints (GWFGBP). On the other side, the CWF cannot solve these two general forms of the RRA problems, due to the difficulty to solve the non-linear system with multiple non-linear equations and inequalities in multiple dual variables. Optimality of the proposed water-filling solution is strictly proved for each of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed approach is effective, efficient, easy to follow and insight-seeing.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.061713.130278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6571302/06547819.pdf","startPage":"3637","endPage":"3647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.061713.130278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Water-Filling: A Geometric Approach and its Application to Solve Generalized Radio Resource Allocation Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547819/","displayDocTitle":"Water-Filling: A Geometric Approach and its Application to Solve Generalized Radio Resource Allocation Problems","volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13674041","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547819/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Water-Filling: A Geometric Approach and its Application to Solve Generalized Radio Resource Allocation Problems","sourcePdf":"3637-tw1307-he.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07552S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"6571302","articleId":"6547819","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6547822,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed M.

We consider an overlay secondary network employing a random access scheme in which secondary users access the channel by certain access probabilities that are functions of the spectrum sensing metric. In setting our problem, we assume that secondary users can eavesdrop on the primary link's feedback. We study the cognitive radio network from a queuing theory point of view. Access probabilities are determined by solving a secondary throughput maximization problem subject to a constraint on the primary queues' stability. First, we formulate our problem which is found to be non-convex. Yet, we solve it efficiently by exploiting the structure of the secondary throughput equation. Our scheme yields improved results in, both, the secondary user throughput and the primary user packet delay as compared to the scheme where no feedback information is exploited. In addition, it comes very close to the optimal genie-aided scheme in which secondary users act upon the presumed perfect knowledge of the primary users' activity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","volume":"12","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"13679335","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547822/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Feedback- Soft Sensing-Based Access Scheme for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Feedback- Soft Sensing-Based Access Scheme for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3226-tw1307-arafa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078338S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6571302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"571302","articleId":"6547822","onlineDate":"26 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6547827,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6547823/6547827/6547827-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Lin received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2008 from Tsinghua University, China, and an M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering in 2010 from the University of Texas at Austin, where she is currently pursuing a PhD degree.

Conventional OFDM receivers that assume additive white Gaussian noise experience degradation in communication performance in impulsive noise. Alternate designs assume a statistical noise model and use the model parameters in mitigating impulsive noise. These receivers require training overhead for parameter estimation, and degrade due to model and parameter mismatch. To mitigate asynchronous impulsive noise, we exploit its sparsity in the time domain, and apply sparse Bayesian learning methods to estimate and subtract the noise impulses. We propose three iterative algorithms with different complexity vs. performance trade-offs: (1) we utilize the noise projection onto null and pilot tones; (2) we add the information in the date tones to perform joint noise estimation and symbol detection; (3) we use decision feedback from the decoder to further enhance the accuracy of noise estimation. These algorithms are also embedded in a time-domain block interleaving OFDM system to mitigate periodic impulsive noise. Compared to conventional OFDM receivers, the proposed methods achieve SNR gains of up to 9 dB in coded and 10 dB in uncoded systems in asynchronous impulsive noise, and up to 6 dB in coded systems in periodic impulsive noise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulsive Noise Mitigation in Powerline Communications Using Sparse Bayesian Learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130702","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6547823/06547827.pdf","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547827/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Impulsive Noise Mitigation in Powerline Communications Using Sparse Bayesian Learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6547827/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13596309","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulsive Noise Mitigation in Powerline Communications Using Sparse Bayesian Learning","sourcePdf":"1172jsac0713lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082313S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6547823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"6547823","articleId":"6547827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547828,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6547823/6547828/6547828-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao Li has been pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the University of California, Davis, since 2009.

The enabling technique is the proposed Gossip-based Gauss-Newton (GGN) algorithm, which allows to harness the computation capability of each area (i.e. a database server that accrues data from local sensors) to collaboratively solve for an accurate global state. The DARSE scheme mitigates the influence of bad data by updating their error variances online and re-weighting their contributions adaptively for state estimation. Thus, the global state can be estimated and tracked robustly using near-neighbor communications in each area. Compared to other distributed state estimation techniques, our communication model is flexible with respect to reconfigurations and resilient to random failures as long as the communication network is connected. Furthermore, we prove that the Jacobian of the power flow equations satisfies the Lipschitz condition that is essential for the GGN algorithm to converge to the desired solution. Simulations of the IEEE-118 system show that the DARSE scheme can estimate and track online the global power system state accurately, and degrades gracefully when there are random failures and bad data.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130703","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6547823/06547828.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Decentralized State Estimation and Tracking for Power Systems via Network Gossiping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust Decentralized State Estimation and Tracking for Power Systems via Network Gossiping","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2013","volume":"31","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547828/","accessionNumber":"13596310","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547828/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Decentralized State Estimation and Tracking for Power Systems via Network Gossiping","sourcePdf":"1184jsac0713li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087851S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6547823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6547823","articleId":"6547828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":6547831,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Gook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6547823/6547831/6547831-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byung-Gook Kim (S'10) received his B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2007 from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.

In this paper, we consider a power system with an aggregator and multiple customers with EVs and propose novel electricity load scheduling algorithms which, unlike previous works, jointly consider the load scheduling for appliances and the energy trading using EVs. Specifically, we allow customers to determine how much energy to purchase from or to sell to the aggregator while taking into consideration the load demands of their residential appliances and the associated electricity bill. We propose two different approaches: a collaborative and a non-collaborative approach. In the collaborative approach, we develop an optimal distributed load scheduling algorithm that maximizes the social welfare of the power system. In the non-collaborative approach, we model the energy scheduling problem as a non-cooperative game among self-interested customers, where each customer determines its own load scheduling and energy trading to maximize its own profit. In order to resolve the unfairness between heavy and light customers in the non-collaborative approach, we propose a tiered billing scheme that can control the electricity rates for customers according to their different energy consumption levels. In both approaches, we also consider the uncertainty in the load demands, with which customers' actual energy consumption may vary from the scheduled energy consumption. To study the impact of the uncertainty, we use the worst-case-uncertainty approach and develop distributed load scheduling algorithms that provide the guaranteed minimum performances in uncertain environments. Subsequently, we show when energy trading leads to an increase in the social welfare and we determine what are the customers' incentives to participate in the energy trading in various usage scenarios including practical environments with uncertain load demands.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6547823/06547831.pdf","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional Energy Trading and Residential Load Scheduling with Electric Vehicles in the Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547831/","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional Energy Trading and Residential Load Scheduling with Electric Vehicles in the Smart Grid","volume":"31","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13596313","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547831/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional Energy Trading and Residential Load Scheduling with Electric Vehicles in the Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"1219jsac0713kim2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09348S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6547823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"6547823","articleId":"6547831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6547833,"authors":[{"name":"Lazaros Gkatzikis","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communications Engineering, University of Thessaly"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6547823/6547833/6547833-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lazaros Gkatzikis (S '09, M '13) obtained the Diploma in Computer Engineering in 2006 and the M.S. degree in Communication engineering from the Department of Computer Engineering and Communications of University of Thessaly in 2008.

In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical market model for the smart grid where a set of competing aggregators act as intermediaries between the utility operator and the home users. The operator seeks to minimize the smart grid operational cost and offers rewards to aggregators toward this goal. Profit-maximizing aggregators compete to sell DR services to the operator and provide compensation to end-users in order to modify their preferable consumption pattern. Finally, end-users seek to optimize the tradeoff between earnings received from the aggregator and discomfort from having to modify their pattern. Based on this market model, we first address the benchmark scenario from the point of view of a cost-minimizing operator that has full information about user demands. Then, we consider a DR market, where all entities are self-interested and non-cooperative. The proposed market scheme captures the diverse objectives of the involved entities and, compared to flat pricing, guarantees significant benefits for each. Using realistic demand traces, we quantify the arising DR benefits. Interestingly, users that are extremely willing to modify their consumption pattern do not derive maximum benefit.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6547823/06547833.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547823","startPage":"1247","endPage":"1257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Role of Aggregators in Smart Grid Demand Response Markets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Role of Aggregators in Smart Grid Demand Response Markets","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13596315","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547833/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Role of Aggregators in Smart Grid Demand Response Markets","sourcePdf":"1247jsac0713gkatzikis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063537S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6547823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"320","xplore-issue":"6547823","articleId":"6547833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6547835,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ping Qian","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China","College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6547823/6547835/6547835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Ping Qian (S'08-M'10) received her BEng degree with Honors in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2004, and the PhD degree in Information Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Hong, Hong Kong, in 2010.

The proposed scheme solves a two-stage optimization problem. On one hand, each user reacts to prices announced by the retailer and maximizes its payoff, which is the difference between its quality-of-usage and the payment to the retailer. On the other hand, the retailer designs the real-time prices in response to the forecasted user reactions to maximize its profit. In particular, each user computes its optimal energy consumption either in closed forms or through an efficient iterative algorithm as a function of the prices. At the retailer side, we develop a Simulated-Annealing-based Price Control (SAPC) algorithm to solve the non-convex price optimization problem. In terms of practical implementation, the users and the retailer interact with each other via a limited number of message exchanges to find the optimal prices. By doing so, the retailer can overcome the uncertainty of users' responses, and users can determine their energy usage based on the actual prices to be used. Our simulation results show that the proposed real-time pricing scheme can effectively shave the energy usage peaks, reduce the retailer's cost, and improve the payoffs of the users.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6547823/06547835.pdf","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547835/","displayDocTitle":"Demand Response Management via Real-Time Electricity Price Control in Smart Grids","volume":"31","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13596317","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547835/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand Response Management via Real-Time Electricity Price Control in Smart Grids","sourcePdf":"1268jsac0713qian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090761S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6547823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"6547823","articleId":"6547835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6547837,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsub Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6547823/6547837/6547837-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsub Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, in 2007, and he is currently pursuing Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering (with minors in applied mathematics and statistics) at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.

For weak adversaries with only local information, a heuristic method of undetectable attack is proposed. Countermeasures to prevent undetectable attacks are also considered. It is shown that undetectable attacks do not exist if a set of meters satisfying a certain branch covering property are protected.

First, construction strategies for unobservable sparse data injection attacks on power grids are proposed for an attacker with access to all network information and nodes. Specifically, novel formulations for the optimization problem that provide a flexible design of the trade-off between performance and false alarm are proposed. In addition, the centralized case is extended to a distributed framework for both the estimation and attack problems. Different distributed scenarios are proposed depending on assumptions that lead to the spreading of the resources, network nodes and players. Consequently, for each of the presented frameworks a corresponding optimization problem is introduced jointly with an algorithm to solve it.

Smart meters have not only allowed for efficient management of many end-users, but also have made AMI an attractive target for remote exploits and local physical tampering with the end goal of stealing energy. While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior. Our experimental results on normal and anomalous load profiles show that AMIDS can identify energy theft efforts with high accuracy. Furthermore, AMIDS correctly identified legitimate load profile changes that more elementary analyses classified as malicious.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6547823/06547839.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547823","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Sensor Energy Theft Detection Framework for Advanced Metering Infrastructures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Sensor Energy Theft Detection Framework for Advanced Metering Infrastructures","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547839/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13596321","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6547839/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Sensor Energy Theft Detection Framework for Advanced Metering Infrastructures","sourcePdf":"1319jsac0713mclaughlin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10705S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6547823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6547823","articleId":"6547839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6547840,"authors":[{"name":"Onur Tan","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f3gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6547823/6547840/6547840-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Onur Tan received the B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey in 2007 and the M.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey in 2010, respectively.","Currently he is pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Telecommunication Engineering at CTTC (Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya) and at Signal Theory and Communications Department of UPC (Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya), Barcelona, Spain.

By providing near realtime information on the energy consumption of individual users, smart meters increase the efficiency in generation, distribution and storage of energy in a smart grid. The ability of the utility provider to track users' energy consumption inevitably leads to important threats to privacy. In this paper, privacy in a smart metering system is studied from an information theoretic perspective in the presence of energy harvesting and storage units. It is shown that energy harvesting provides increased privacy by diversifying the energy source, while a storage device can be used to increase both the energy efficiency and the privacy of the user. For given input load and energy harvesting rates, it is shown that there exists a trade-off between the information leakage rate, which is used to measure the privacy of the user, and the wasted energy rate, which is a measure of the energy-efficiency. The impact of the energy harvesting rate and the size of the storage device on this trade-off is also studied.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in

The array operates in linear polarization and consists of 20 \u00d7 20 unit-cells. A 1-bit phase resolution has been selected for the unit-cell in order to reduce the complexity of the biasing network and steering logic, the insertion loss and the overall cost of the antenna system. The unit-cell stack-up is simple and is made of four metal layers: active side, biasing lines, ground plane and passive side. Two p-i-n diodes are integrated on the active side of each cell in order to control its transmission phase. The active array contains 800 diodes in total. It demonstrates experimentally pencil beam scanning over a 140 \u00d7 80-degree window over a 15.8% fractional bandwidth, with a maximum gain of 22.7 dBi at broadside. We also show that the same antenna array can be used for beam shaping applications (flat-top beam). The experimental results presented between 8 and 12 GHz are in good agreement with the theoretical performance calculated using full-wave electromagnetic simulations and an in-house CAD tool based on analytical modeling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband 400-Element Electronically Reconfigurable Transmitarray in X Band","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2271493","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6617741/06547987.pdf","startPage":"5017","endPage":"5027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2271493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6617741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Wideband 400-Element Electronically Reconfigurable Transmitarray in X Band","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6547987/","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband 400-Element Electronically Reconfigurable Transmitarray in X Band","sourcePdf":"tap-dussopt-2271493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105303S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6617741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6617741","articleId":"6547987","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6547993,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofu Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293518500"},{"name":"Zhen Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37422901400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6547993","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verification-Based Interval-Passing Algorithm for Compressed Sensing","abstract":"We propose a verification-based Interval-Passing (IP) algorithm for iteratively reconstruction of nonnegative sparse signals using parity check matrices of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes as measurement matrices.

However, segmenting the small bowel directly on computed tomography (CT) scans is very difficult because of the low image contrast on CT scans and high tortuosity of the small bowel and its close proximity to other abdominal organs. Motivated by the intensity characteristics of abdominal CT images, the anatomic relationship between the mesenteric vasculature and the small bowel, and potential usefulness of the mesenteric vasculature for establishing the path of the small bowel, we propose a novel mesenteric vasculature map-guided method for small bowel segmentation on high-resolution CT angiography scans. The major mesenteric arteries are first segmented using a vessel tracing method based on multi-linear subspace vessel model and Bayesian inference. Second, multi-view, multi-scale vesselness enhancement filters are used to segment small vessels, and vessels directly or indirectly connecting to the superior mesenteric artery are classified as mesenteric vessels. Third, a mesenteric vasculature map is built by linking vessel bifurcation points, and the small bowel is segmented by employing the mesenteric vessel map and fuzzy connectness. The method was evaluated on 11 abdominal CT scans of patients suspected of having carcinoid tumors with manually labeled reference standard. The result, 82.5% volume overlap accuracy compared with the reference standard, shows it is feasible to segment the small bowel on CT scans using the mesenteric vasculature as a roadmap.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2271487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6648718/06547997.pdf","startPage":"2006","endPage":"2021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2271487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mesenteric Vasculature-Guided Small Bowel Segmentation on 3-D CT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Mesenteric Vasculature-Guided Small Bowel Segmentation on 3-D CT","volume":"32","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13865683","pubMedId":"23807437","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6547997/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6547997/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mesenteric Vasculature-Guided Small Bowel Segmentation on 3-D CT","sourcePdf":"tmi-zhang-2271487-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067069S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6648718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6648718","articleId":"6547997","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6548006,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Chahibi","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6670086/6548006/6548006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youssef Chahibi (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912) received the M.S. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA, in 2012, and the Dipl\u00f4me d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur in telecommunications and networks from Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, France, in 2011, and the Ph.

Drugs composed of micro- or nano-sized particles (particulate DDS) that are able to cross barriers which prevent large particles from escaping the bloodstream are used in the most advanced solutions. Molecular communication (MC) is used as an abstraction of the propagation of drug particles in the body. MC is a new paradigm in communication research where the exchange of information is achieved through the propagation of molecules. Here, the transmitter is the drug injection, the receiver is the drug delivery, and the channel is realized by the transport of drug particles, thus enabling the analysis and design of a particulate DDS using communication tools. This is achieved by modeling the MC channel as two separate contributions, namely, the cardiovascular network model and the drug propagation network. The cardiovascular network model allows to analytically compute the blood velocity profile in every location of the cardiovascular system given the flow input by the heart. The drug propagation network model allows the analytical expression of the drug delivery rate at the targeted site given the drug injection rate. Numerical results are also presented to assess the flexibility and accuracy of the developed model. The study of novel optimization techniques for a more effective and less invasive drug delivery will be aided by this model, while paving the way for novel communication techniques for Intrabody communication networks.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2271503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2271503","startPage":"3468","endPage":"3483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6670086/06548006.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Molecular Communication System Model for Particulate Drug Delivery Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Molecular Communication System Model for Particulate Drug Delivery Systems","volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13914201","pubMedId":"23807425","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548006/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Molecular Communication System Model for Particulate Drug Delivery Systems","sourcePdf":"tbme-chahibi-2271503-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.239502S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6670086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6670086","articleId":"6548006","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":6548008,"authors":[{"name":"Tariq Ali","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6740850/6548008/6548008-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tariq Ali (S'08\u2013M'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2001, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, in 2011, where he works as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate and Lecturer.","His research interests include convergence of heterogeneous wireless networks, interference management, radar imaging, sensor network localization, etc. He has worked on several collaboration projects with Nokia Corporation, SNRLabs Corporation, US Air-force, Texas Instruments, and Semiconductor Research Corporation."]},"firstName":"Tariq","lastName":"Ali","id":"37530870200"},{"name":"Ahmed Z.

We show how a MIMO radar imaging system can outperform a traditional radar system by reducing the number of transceiver antennas without sacrificing the image resolution. We use a minimum mean square error (MMSE) type receiver structure for this application that minimizes both interference and hardware complexity. We show how a group of sensor nodes can work together in determining one or more targets' locations. A radar image obtained from a single node can detect the presence of targets, but not provide a precise location information. However, spatially scattered group of nodes can together interpolate the targets' positions relative to them and obtain localization information. We provide an in-depth analysis of a MIMO radar system, and demonstrate the operation and utility of such target localization methods using sensor networks through simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radar for Target Detection and Localization in Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260632","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/6740850/06548008.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radar for Target Detection and Localization in Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6548008/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111599","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radar for Target Detection and Localization in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-ali-2260632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116849S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6740850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6740850","articleId":"6548008","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6548012,"authors":[{"name":"Yangming Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6683081/6548012/6548012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yangming Li received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in computer science and engineering from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, In 2003 and 2006, respectively; and the Ph.D. degree in automatic control engineering from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2010.","He is currently an Associate Research Fellow (associate Professor) at the Robot Sensor and Human-machine Interaction Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.

The joint compatibility test is commonly regarded as the true solution to the problem. However, traditional joint compatibility tests are computationally expensive, are sensitive to linearization errors, and require the knowledge of the full covariance matrix of state variables. The paper proposes a posterior-based joint compatibility test scheme to conquer the three problems mentioned above. The posterior-based test naturally separates the test of state variables from the test of observations. Therefore, through the introduction of the robot movement and proper approximation, the joint test process is sequentialized to the sum of individual tests; therefore, the test has O(n) complexity (compared with O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) for traditional tests), where n denotes the total number of related observations. At the same time, the sequentialized test neither requires the knowledge to the full covariance matrix of state variables nor is sensitive to linearization errors caused by poor pose estimates. The paper also shows how to apply the proposed method to various simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both simulated data and popular datasets show the proposed method outperforms some classical algorithms, including sequential compatibility nearest neighbor (SCNN), random sample consensus (RANSAC), and joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB), on precision, efficiency, and robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13973014","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6548012/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast and Robust Data Association Using Posterior Based Approximate Joint Compatibility Test","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Robust Data Association Using Posterior Based Approximate Joint Compatibility Test","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2271506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059824S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6683081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6683081","articleId":"6548012","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6548013,"authors":[{"name":"Mari\u00e1 Perez-Orti\u017a","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6787013/6548013/perez-2266336-small.gif","p":["Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez-Ortiz was born in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, in 1990.

This paper proposes an ensemble methodology specifically adapted to this type of problem, which is based on computing different classification tasks through the formulation of different order hypotheses. Every single model is trained in order to distinguish between one given class (k) and all the remaining ones, while grouping them in those classes with a rank lower than k, and those with a rank higher than k. Therefore, it can be considered as a reformulation of the well-known one-versus-all scheme. The base algorithm for the ensemble could be any threshold (or even probabilistic) method, such as the ones selected in this paper: kernel discriminant analysis, support vector machines and logistic regression (LR) (all reformulated to deal with ordinal regression problems). The method is seen to be competitive when compared with other state-of-the-art methodologies (both ordinal and nominal), by using six measures and a total of 15 ordinal datasets. Furthermore, an additional set of experiments is used to study the potential scalability and interpretability of the proposed method when using LR as base methodology for the ensemble.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2013.2266336","startPage":"681","endPage":"694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2013.2266336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6787013","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6787013/06548013.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection-Based Ensemble Learning for Ordinal Regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548013/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Projection-Based Ensemble Learning for Ordinal Regression","volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6548013/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14236955","pubMedId":"23807481","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection-Based Ensemble Learning for Ordinal Regression","sourcePdf":"tcyb-perezortiz-2266336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083918S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6787013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6787013","articleId":"6548013","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":6548016,"authors":[{"name":"Kaixue Ma","affiliation":["Virtus IC Design Center of Excellence, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kaixue","lastName":"Ma","id":"37289937100"},{"name":"Shouxian Mou","affiliation":["Virtus IC Design Center of Excellence, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shouxian","lastName":"Mou","id":"37329892100"},{"name":"Kiat Seng Yeo","affiliation":["Virtus IC Design Center of Excellence, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kiat Seng","lastName":"Yeo","id":"37277042100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6548016","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1013},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band-pass filters","Couplings","System-on-chip","Capacitors","Insertion loss","CMOS technology","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","elliptic filters","field effect MIMIC","Ge-Si alloys","semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniaturized on-chip multimode quasielliptical bandpass filter","on-chip multimode BPF","loaded sandwich capacitor","multimode perturbation","stopband control","BPF design","magnetic coupling path","quasielliptical filter response","commercial silicon germanium BiCMOS process","insertion loss","compact size","frequency 60 GHz","loss 4 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60 GHz","elliptical filter","filter","microstrip","millimeter wave","multimode resonator (MMR)","SiGe BiCMOS"]}],"abstract":"A 60-GHz on-chip multimode bandpass filter (BPF) is implemented using a sandwich capacitor.

In this approach, a linear vehicle bicycle model is augmented with a simple visual model. As the visual model contains few uncertain parameters and increases the observer's design freedom, the combined model-based estimator provides more accurate estimation result compared with the traditional bicycle-model-based one. However, two issues are raised by the combined vehicle and vision models: 1) image processing introduces delay in the visual measurements, and 2) the sampling time of a normal camera is much longer than that of other onboard sensors. For electric vehicles, the control period of motors is much shorter than the sampling time of a normal camera. Considering the aforementioned delay and multirate problems, a multirate Kalman filter with intersample compensation is designed, and the estimation performance can be improved during the sampling intervals of the vision system. Then, a two-degree-of-freedom controller is designed using the estimated body slip angle as feedback for reference tracking. With the proposed multirate estimator, the controller achieves better tracking performance than the singlerate method. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator and controller is demonstrated by both simulations and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2271596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6577900/06548052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2271596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6577900","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate Estimation and Control of Body Slip Angle for Electric Vehicles Based on Onboard Vision System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multirate Estimation and Control of Body Slip Angle for Electric Vehicles Based on Onboard Vision System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13706360","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate Estimation and Control of Body Slip Angle for Electric Vehicles Based on Onboard Vision System","sourcePdf":"tie-wang-2271596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055073S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"6577900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","articleId":"6548052","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6548056,"authors":[{"name":"Klaus Schuegraf","affiliation":["Cymer, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/6564405/6548056/6548056-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Klaus Schuegraf is the Group Vice President for EUV Development & Engineering with Cymer Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA, an ASML company.

To remove myoelectric interference from neural recordings, a resistor-capacitor network is used to balance the electrode impedances in the tripole. The amplifier is programmable (recording mode, passband, gain, and trimming impedance) via a serial peripheral interface. Its front-end instrumentation amplifier employs current feedback to achieve high common-mode rejection ratio. The circuit was implemented in 0.35- \u03bcm CMOS technology and occupies an area of ~1.2 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. In the very-low noise mode, the analog front-end features a maximum of 0.68 \u03bcVrms input-referred noise in the passband and consumes ~310 \u03bcA from a 3 V supply. The measured common-mode rejection ratio of the instrumentation amplifier (CMRRIA) approaches 100 dB. The effect of component mismatch on the CMRRIA and the noise performance of the instrumentation amplifier are examined. In addition, the recording tripole is analyzed to derive the overall common-mode rejection ratio that is shown to exceed 80 dB.

The Bayesian framework facilitates incremental learning. It incorporates three personal dietary tendencies that influence food analysis: likelihood, prior distribution, and mealtime category. In the evaluation of the proposed method using images uploaded to FoodLog, both food-image detection and food-balance estimation are improved. In particular, in the food-balance estimation, the mean absolute error is significantly reduced from 0.69 servings to 0.28 servings on average for two persons using more than 200 personal images, and 0.59 servings to 0.48 servings on average for four persons using 100 personal images.

To this end an advanced transmitter with a digital pulse-shaper is compared to analog transmitters relying on pulse-shaping with electrical and optical filters, respectively. The signal quality is assessed within a single carrier setup as well as within an ultra-densely spaced WDM arrangement comprising three channels. An advanced receiver providing additional digital filtering with an adaptive equalization algorithm to approximate an ideal brick-wall Nyquist filter has been used for all schemes. It is found that at lower symbol rates, where digital processing is still feasible, digital filters with a large number of filter coefficients provide the best performance. However, transmitters equipped with only electrical or optical pulse-shapers already outperform transmitters sending plain unshaped NRZ signals, so that for higher symbol rates analog electrical and optical techniques not only save costs, but are the only adequate solution.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2271513","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6542668/06548067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2271513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542668","startPage":"2570","endPage":"2577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse-Shaping With Digital, Electrical, and Optical Filters\u2014A Comparison","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pulse-Shaping With Digital, Electrical, and Optical Filters\u2014A Comparison","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548067/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"15","publicationDate":"Aug.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13689015","dateOfInsertion":"03 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548067/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse-Shaping With Digital, Electrical, and Optical Filters\u2014A Comparison","sourcePdf":"jlt-schmogrow-2271513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084796S","chronDate":"Aug.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6542668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6542668","articleId":"6548067","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6548072,"authors":[{"name":"Jacobus Daniel van Wyk","affiliation":["Group on Electronic Energy Processing, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/6572818/6548072/6548072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jacobus Daniel van Wyk (M'81\u2013SM'84\u2013F'90\u2013LF'10) received the M.Sc.Eng. degree from the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, in 1966, the Dr.Sc.Tech. degree (cum laude) from the Technical University of Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 1969, the D.Sc.

Technologies have specific life cycles that are driven by internal innovation, subsequently reaching maturity. Power electronics appears to be a much more complex case, functioning as an enabling technology spanning an enormous range of power levels, functions and applications. Power electronics is also divided into many constituent technologies. Till now, the development of power electronics has been driven chiefly by internal semiconductor technology and converter circuit technology, approaching maturity in its internally set metrics, such as efficiency. This paper examines critically the fundamental functions found in electronic energy processing, the constituent technologies comprising power electronics, and the power electronics technology space in light of the internal driving philosophy of power electronics and its historical development. It is finally concluded that, although approaching the limits of its internal metrics indicates internal maturity, the external constituent technologies of packaging, manufacturing, electromagnetic and physical impact, and converter control technology still present remarkable opportunities for development.

The model predicts the compression performance of MVC as a function of the correlation between cameras with overlapping fields of view. We define the common sensed area (CSA) between different views, and emphasize that it depends not only on geometrical relationships among the relative positions of different cameras, but also on various object-related phenomena, e.g., occlusions and motion, and on low-level phenomena such as variations in illumination. With these premises, we first experimentally characterize the relationship between MVC compression gain (with respect to single view video coding) and the CSA between views. Our experiments are based on the H.264 MVC standard, and on a low-complexity estimator of the CSA that can be computed with low inter-node signaling overhead. Then, we propose a compact empirical model of the efficiency of MVC as a function of the CSA between views, and we validate the model with different multiview video sequences. Finally, we show how the model can be applied to typical scenarios in WMSN, i.e., to clustered or multi-hop topologies, and we show a few promising results of its application in the definition of cross-layer clustering and data aggregation procedures.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2271475","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6663669/06548078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2271475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663669","startPage":"1800","endPage":"1814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Empirical Model of Multiview Video Coding Efficiency for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Empirical Model of Multiview Video Coding Efficiency for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13896736","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548078/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Empirical Model of Multiview Video Coding Efficiency for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tmm-colonnese-2271475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087529S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6663669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6663669","articleId":"6548078","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6548083,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Sabattini","affiliation":["Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Sabattini","id":"37594737400"},{"name":"Cristian Secchi","affiliation":["Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Secchi","id":"37300905500"},{"name":"Nikhil Chopra","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Chopra","id":"37283228300"},{"name":"Andrea Gasparri","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Roma Tre University, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Gasparri","id":"37298363400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"6548083","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1583},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","distributed control","graph theory","maintenance engineering","mobile robots","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","multirobot systems","global connectivity maintenance","decentralized estimation strategy","algebraic connectivity maintenance property","generic additional control term","bounded additional control term","negative gradient","single communication link","communication graph disconnection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed robot systems","global connectivity maintenance","networked robots"]}],"abstract":"This study introduces a control algorithm that, exploiting a completely decentralized estimation strategy for the algebraic connectivity of the graph, ensures the connectivity maintenance property for multi robot systems, in the presence of a generic (bounded) additional control term.

Assuming that the sensor data is sparse in some basis, we show that the recovery of this sparse signal can be formulated as a compressive sensing (CS) problem. To model the scenario in which the sensors operate with intermittently available energy that is harvested from the environment, we propose that each sensor transmits independently with some probability, and adapts the transmit power to its harvested energy. Due to the probabilistic transmissions, the elements of the equivalent sensing matrix are not Gaussian. Besides, since the sensors have different energy harvesting rates and different sensor-to-FC distances, the FC has different receive signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for each sensor. This is referred to as the inhomogeneity of SNRs. Thus, the elements of the sensing matrix are also not identically distributed. For this unconventional setting, we provide theoretical guarantees on the number of measurements for reliable and computationally efficient recovery, by showing that the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), under reasonable conditions. We then compute an achievable system delay under an allowable mean-squared-error (MSE). Furthermore, using techniques from large deviations theory, we analyze the impact of inhomogeneity of SNRs on the so-called k-restricted eigenvalues, which governs the number of measurements required for the RIP to hold. We conclude that the number of measurements required for the RIP is not sensitive to the inhomogeneity of SNRs, when the number of sensors n is large and the sparsity of the sensor data (signal) k grows slower than the square root of n. Our analysis is corroborated by extensive numerical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Compressive Sensing for Energy Harvesting Sensor Nodes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2271480","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6578576/06548096.pdf","startPage":"4491","endPage":"4505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2271480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Compressive Sensing for Energy Harvesting Sensor Nodes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/6548096/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13820955","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Compressive Sensing for Energy Harvesting Sensor Nodes","sourcePdf":"tsp-yang-2271480-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085135S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6578576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6578576","articleId":"6548096","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6548098,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Chieh Fang","affiliation":["Sunplus Technology, Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chung-Chieh Fang received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, all in electrical engineering.

Besides the internal power transfer and phase drift phenomena mentioned in previous works, there are also many other novel phenomena caused by the dead time, such as voltage polarity reversal and voltage sag phenomena, etc. The paper gives a detailed switching characterization of the IBDC with dead-time effect in all operation states. On this basis, the transmission power characterization is analyzed comprehensively. Compared to the traditional theoretical model, the transmission power model with dead-time effect is not a strictly monotone increasing function, the relation curve is not symmetric around the median axis, and the zero point is not achieved at zero phase-shift ratio. In addition, in different operation states, the characterization is also different. Finally, experimental results verify the theoretical analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6632912/06548099.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2271511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2271511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dead-Time Effect of the High-Frequency Isolated Bidirectional Full-Bridge DC\u2013DC Converter: Comprehensive Theoretical Analysis and Experimental Verification","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dead-time effect","isolated bidirectional full-bridge dc-dc converter","IBDC","internal power transfer","phase drift phenomena","voltage polarity reversal","voltage sag phenomena","transmission power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dc\u2013dc converter","dead timed","phase-shift control","silicon carbide","switching","transmission power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Dead-Time Effect of the High-Frequency Isolated Bidirectional Full-Bridge DC\u2013DC Converter: Comprehensive Theoretical Analysis and Experimental Verification","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6548099/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13843305","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dead-Time Effect of the High-Frequency Isolated Bidirectional Full-Bridge DC\u2013DC Converter: Comprehensive Theoretical Analysis and Experimental Verification","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhao-2271511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095145S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6548099","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6548101,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Ohwatari","affiliation":["NTT DOCOMO, INC., Research Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6710258/6548101/6548101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yusuke Ohwatari (M'12) received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering, the M.E. degree in information science and technology, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, in 2005, 2007, and 2013, respectively.","Since 2007, he has been with the Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Kanagawa, Japan.

When assuming the Long Term Evolution (LTE) or LTE-Advanced downlink and open-loop transmit diversity employing the space-frequency block code (SFBC) using Alamouti coding, the IRC receiver must detect the Alamouti coded signals and suppress the interference signals using a couple of received signals in the frequency domain at the same time. To achieve this, the IRC receiver weight matrix, which consists of the channel matrix of the serving cell and the statistics of the covariance matrix, including the interference and thermal noise components, must be extended in the frequency domain, i.e., due to the effect of Alamouti coding, in addition to the spatial domain. These extended matrices can be estimated using the downlink reference signals (RSs) from the serving cell. However, some elements, including the effect of Alamouti coding in the extended covariance matrix, cannot be estimated using a practical estimation scheme that subtracts the replica symbols of the serving cell generated by the estimated channel matrix and the known RS sequence from the received RSs of the serving cell. This is because the RSs in LTE/LTE-Advanced are not transmitted using two adjacent subcarriers. This paper investigates the statistics of these unknown elements and proposes appropriate values, specifically inserting zero values, for these elements assuming the LTE/LTE-Advanced downlink. The results of simulations show that the IRC receiver using the proposed scheme, which has two receiver antenna branches, suppresses the intercell interference and improves the throughput by more than 10% compared with that for the conventional maximal ratio combining (MRC) receiver when a cell-edge environment is assumed.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2271508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2271508","startPage":"191","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6710258/06548101.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on Interference Rejection Combining Receiver for Space\u2013Frequency Block Code Transmit Diversity in LTE-Advanced Downlink","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on Interference Rejection Combining Receiver for Space\u2013Frequency Block Code Transmit Diversity in LTE-Advanced Downlink","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548101/","accessionNumber":"14031714","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548101/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on Interference Rejection Combining Receiver for Space\u2013Frequency Block Code Transmit Diversity in LTE-Advanced Downlink","sourcePdf":"tvt-ohwatari-2271508-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067571S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6710258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6710258","articleId":"6548101","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6548102,"authors":[{"name":"Hongliang Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6663669/6548102/6548102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongliang Li (SM'12) received his Ph.D. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 2005.

The first term is to measure the salient objects from each image using multiscale segmentation voting. The second term is designed to detect the co-salient objects from a group of images. To compute the IrIS map, we perform the pairwise similarity ranking based on an image pyramid representation. A minimum spanning tree is then constructed to determine the image matching order. For each region in an image, we design three types of visual descriptors, which are extracted from the local appearance, e.g., color, color co-occurrence and shape properties. The final region matching problem between the images is formulated as an assignment problem that can be optimized by linear programming. Experimental evaluation on a number of images demonstrates the good performance of the proposed method on co-salient object detection.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2271476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6663669/06548102.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2271476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663669","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-Salient Object Detection From Multiple Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Co-Salient Object Detection From Multiple Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13896728","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548102/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-Salient Object Detection From Multiple Images","sourcePdf":"tmm-li-2271476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130592S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6663669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6663669","articleId":"6548102","onlineDate":"27 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6548138,"authors":[{"name":"Vamsi Talla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA"],"firstName":"Vamsi","lastName":"Talla","id":"38580630500"},{"name":"Joshua R.

Sampled phase data from RFID signals which are backscattered to single or multiple antennas combined with the information on the relative RFID tag trajectory are used to reconstruct the tag's absolute trajectory. The paper describes basic properties of synthetic apertures in RFID systems and methods of evaluating beam patterns based on array beam steering theory.

With the continuous improvement of sensitivity for tag chip, the unreliable reverse link may become the bottleneck for the whole system. In this paper, a nested error correcting code (ECC) based data transfer method is proposed to enhance the reliability of reverse link while maintaining the acceptable read efficiency. The information bits are encoded in the nested way to get the redundant bits for each layer. The reader writes the original information bits and all redundant bits into the tag. During the reading process, the reader gets the redundant bits at different layer in an incremental manner. The purpose is to correct the errors by requiring as less redundant bits as possible. According to the numerical results, the reliability in terms of residual error probability is improved significantly compared to the normal scheme with only CRC check. However, the efficiency in terms of average time to get information bits is much better than the single code protection scheme. Therefore, the proposed scheme can get a good tradeoff between reliability and efficiency. On the other hand, the proposed scheme can be implemented in software, requiring no modifications on the reader hardware and tag.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2013.6548150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2013.6548150","startPage":"160","endPage":"167","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6531144/6548123/06548150.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nested error correcting code based highly reliable data reading for UHF RFID","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548150/","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"Nested error correcting code based highly reliable data reading for UHF RFID","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13613297","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548150/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nested error correcting code based highly reliable data reading for UHF RFID","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p160yuan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070758S","chronDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6531144","isNumber":"6548123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531144","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6548123","articleId":"6548150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6548151,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Wei Xie","id":"37070014900"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Lei Xie","id":"37400139600"},{"name":"Chen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Chen Zhang","id":"37070492100"},{"name":"Quan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Quan Zhang","id":"37534506900"},{"name":"Chaojing Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Chaojing Tang","id":"37540145100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5750-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5748-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5749-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548151","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Authentication","Protocols","Virtual private networks","Cloud computing","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptographic protocols","data privacy","database management systems","radiofrequency identification","telecommunication security","trusted computing","virtual private networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud-based RFID authentication protocol","cloud computing","backend sever-based RFID authentication","secure backend channel","trustworthy database","virtual private network","anonymous access","cloud database","hash table encryption","tag-reader privacy","database security","mobile reader holder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID","cloud computing","authentication"]}],"abstract":"Along with the development of cloud computing, cloud-based RFID is receiving more and more attentions of researchers and engineers. However, there is no research in which cloud computing is applied to RFID authentication schemes. Most current works lay emphasis on functionalities, lacking considerations about security and privacy. Classical RFID authentication schemes fail to meet the special security and privacy requirements of cloud-based RFID. The basic postulates of traditional backend-sever-based RFID authentication, i.e. secure backend channel and entirely trustworthy database, are no longer natively tenable in cloud-based RFID scenarios. In this paper, a virtual private network agency is suggested to build secure backend channels and to provide readers with anonymous access to the cloud. The cloud database is structured as an encrypted hash table. The first cloud-based RFID authentication protocol preserving tag/reader privacy to database keepers is proposed. Comparing with classical schemes, the proposed scheme has advantages in deployment cost saving, pervasiveness of authentication, scalability of O(1) complexity to verify a tag, mobile reader holders' privacy preserving, and database security.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2013.6548151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548123","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6531144/6548123/06548151.pdf","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud-based RFID authentication","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2013.6548151","startPage":"168","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-based RFID authentication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548151/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13613298","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548151/","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-based RFID authentication","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p168xie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059297S","chronDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6531144","isNumber":"6548123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531144","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6548123","articleId":"6548151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6548152,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaud Vena","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Rauma Research Unit, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Vena","id":"37547299500"},{"name":"Elham Moradi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Rauma Research Unit, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Moradi","id":"38541626100"},{"name":"Karoliina Koski","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Rauma Research Unit, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Karoliina","lastName":"Koski","id":"37948477100"},{"name":"A.

These empirical results show that CC allows for graceful system degradation and IR achieves read rates close to the capacity limit.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2013.6548158","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6531144/6548123/06548158.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2013.6548158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid ARQ improvements for RFID systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid ARQ improvements for RFID systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13613305","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548158/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548158/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid ARQ improvements for RFID systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p223boyer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084047S","chronDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6531144","isNumber":"6548123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531144","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6548123","articleId":"6548158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6548161,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Arnitz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Arnitz","id":"37403156600"},{"name":"Matthew S.

The proposed method does not require on-tag power measurements or on-tag channel estimation, either of which would add significant complexity and power consumption for microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices such as passive UHF RFID tags. We show in a measurement-based proof of concept that WPT optimization to nonlinear backscatter transponders is possible solely based on the backscatter signal, without knowledge of the incident power level at the tag or prior knowledge of the tag's characteristics. Using an 8\u00d78 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery, we observed an average WPT enhancement of 8.9 dB relative to an un-optimized 8-transmitter configuration across a 50m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n volume in an office/lab environment. We also show that power to a given tag can be selectively denied, with a notch depth of -106.4 dB (noise floor of the presented measurements). These results are comparable to values previously observed for linear backscatter transponders, and suggest that the use of MIMO interrogators could lead to improved forward-link performance and thus efficiently provide power for sensors or other new power-hungry functions on passive transponders.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548161/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13613308","publicationDate":"April 2013","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548161/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wireless power transfer optimization for nonlinear passive backscatter devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless power transfer optimization for nonlinear passive backscatter devices","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p245arnitz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058672S","chronDate":"April 30 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6531144","isNumber":"6548123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531144","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6548123","articleId":"6548161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6548214,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Balouchestani","affiliation":["Electric and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Balouchestani","id":"37703670400"},{"name":"Kaamran Raahemifar","affiliation":["Electric and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Kaamran","lastName":"Raahemifar","id":"37273545200"},{"name":"Sridhar Krishnan","affiliation":["Electric and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Sridhar","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37275777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2971-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2970-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2969-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548214","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Biomedical measurement","Simulation","Medical diagnostic imaging","Wireless sensor networks","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","body area networks","body sensor networks","cardiology","compressed sensing","diseases","electrocardiography","health care","hospitals","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low sampling-rate approach","ECG signals","compressed sensing theory","wireless body area network","biomedical wireless sensors","human body","WBAN","biomedical data","gate way","hospitals","medical centers","therapeutic purposes","electrocardiogram signals","medical diagnosis","heart diseases","health care","electronic health","mobile health","ambulatory health monitoring systems","AHMS","power consumption","block sparse Bayesian learning","dynamic thresholding approach","DTA","BSBL","signal-to-noise ratio","EH","MH","percentage root-mean-square difference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling-rate","Dynamic Thresholding Approach","ECG Signal","Compressed Sensing","Block Sparse Bayesian learning"]}],"abstract":"A Wireless Body Area network (WBAN) is a special purpose of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to connect various Biomedical Wireless Sensors (BWSs) located inside and outside of the human body to collect and transmit vital signals. The collected biomedical data send out via Gate Way (GW) to external databases at the hospitals and medical centers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are widely used in health care systems because they are noninvasive mechanisms to establish medical diagnosis of heart diseases. In order to fully exploit the benefits of WBANs to Electronic Health (EH), Mobile Health (MH), and Ambulatory Health Monitoring Systems (AHMS) the power consumption and sampling rate should be restricted to a minimum. With this in mind, Compressed Sensing (CS) procedure and the collaboration of Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL)based on Dynamic Thresholding Approach (DTA) is used to provide a robust low sampling-rate approach for normal and abnormal ECG signals. Advanced WBANs based on our approach will be able to deliver healthcare not only to patients in hospital and medical centers; but also in their homes and workplaces thus offering cost saving, and improving the quality of life.

Because of the demand of constant accurate flow in microfluidic system, the approach to measure volume of microfluid is in urgent need. The accuracy of the volume measurements is limited by the selected parameters of the image processing. During the experiment, the optimum parameters of the image processing are selected through repeated tests. The obtained results are in good agreement with the demand.

For those tasks in complicated or tiny underwater environments, some kinds of underwater microrobots have been developed. Thanks to the developments of smart actuators, microrobots realized relatively high performance within a compact structure. But problems in velocity and sustainable time limited their application. To solve this problem, we proposed a mother-son robot system, which include several microrobots as son robots, and an amphibious spherical robot as the mother robot. In this paper, a mother robot was proposed. It was designed to be able to walk on land, as well as move in water using a vectored water-jet mechanism. As the mother robot in the under-developing system, it also contained the space for transporting microrobots, and two openable hulls to protect the microrobots from the water currents and obstacles in water. A pressure sensor was used to determine whether robot was on land or in water, and measure the depth while in the underwater situation. To avoid obstacles, eight infrared distance sensors were used to detect obstacles in all the directions around the robot. In order to evaluate the robot's underwater performance, some experiments were conducted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548323/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13612695","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Development of a spherical amphibious mother robot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a spherical amphibious mother robot","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"CME2013123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074802S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542767","isNumber":"6548194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542767","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6548194","articleId":"6548323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6548424,"authors":[{"name":"Heather Culbertson","affiliation":["Haptics Group, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Heather","lastName":"Culbertson","id":"38232839100"},{"name":"Juliette Unwin","affiliation":["Haptics Group, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Juliette","lastName":"Unwin","id":"37086619278"},{"name":"Benjamin E.

The recorded vibration data is parsed into short segments that represent the feel of the surface at the associated tool force and speed. We create a low-order auto-regressive (AR) model for each data segment and construct a Delaunay triangulation of models in force-speed space for each surface. During texture rendering, we stably interpolate between these models using barycentric coordinates and drive the interpolated model with white noise to output synthetic vibrations. Our methods were validated through application to data recorded by eight human subjects and the experimenter interacting with six textures. We present a new spectral metric for determining perceptual match of the models in order to evaluate the effectiveness and consistency of the segmenting and modeling approach. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the pairwise differences in the synthesized vibrations shows that the 54 created texture models cluster by texture in a two-dimensional perceptual space.","doi":"10.1109/WHC.2013.6548424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHC.2013.6548424","startPage":"295","endPage":"300","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 World Haptics Conference (WHC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530814/6548362/06548424.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 World Haptics Conference (WHC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating haptic texture models from unconstrained tool-surface interactions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Generating haptic texture models from unconstrained tool-surface interactions","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548424/","accessionNumber":"13613015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548424/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating haptic texture models from unconstrained tool-surface interactions","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"295culberts.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104056S","chronDate":"14-17 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530814","isNumber":"6548362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530814","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6548362","articleId":"6548424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6548425,"authors":[{"name":"Anatolii Sianov","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Computer Vision Laboratory, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Anatolii","lastName":"Sianov","id":"37086456575"},{"name":"Matthias Harders","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Computer Vision Laboratory, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Harders","id":"37293816400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0088-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0087-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548425","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548425","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Haptic interfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Kernel","Nonhomogeneous media","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force feedback","function approximation","haptic interfaces","minimisation","pattern clustering","performance evaluation","radial basis function networks","random processes","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational formulation","data-driven haptic rendering","two-staged process","inhomogeneous material behavior handling","force response identification","pattern clustering algorithm","detail-rich radial basis function approximations","radial basis function reconstructions","reaction force signal","l1-minimization","random selection strategy","performance improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Measurement-based synthesis/modeling","Haptic rendering"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we suggest two extensions to our previous work in data-driven haptic rendering.

Optical wireless (or free-space optical (FSO)) is an alternative communication system applicable to air-to-air (A2A) or air-to-ground (A2G) applications. An FSO link is able to provide high bandwidth, low-power, and secure communication for various unmanned aerial systems (UASs) and ground nodes, including mobile and fixed stations. However, unlike RF, optical communication is highly sensitive to misalignment and platform instability that causes unavoidable communication interruptions. Developing aerial optical wireless communication systems requires modeling the effects of UAS instability on the FSO system performance, including FSO link throughput. This work aims to develop a rigid and simple modeling framework for A2A FSO communication links. The framework is abstract, general, and platform-independent. The model relates instability to averaged percentage alignment (APA), which can be used to predict throughput and other performance-related parameters. A planer arrays of optical transmitters and receivers is used and proposed as a promising technology for FSO communication with large field-of-view and diversity-ready performance. Also, a novel alignment model using geometric intersection is developed and analyzed against simulated and real multi-rotor platforms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6531925/6548506/06548513.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2013 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","doi":"10.1109/ICNSurv.2013.6548513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSurv.2013.6548513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548506","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of aerial-to-aerial short-distance free-space optical links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Optical fiber sensors","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","optical communication","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerial-to-aerial short-distance free-space optical links","RF noise floor","scarce wireless spectrum","crowded wireless spectrum","air-to-air application","air-to-ground application","FSO link","unmanned aerial systems","UAS","aerial optical wireless communication systems","FSO system performance","A2A FSO communication links","averaged percentage alignment","planer arrays","optical transmitter","optical receiver","geometric intersection","novel alignment model","diversity-ready performance","large field-of-view performance","optical communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of aerial-to-aerial short-distance free-space optical links","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548513/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628505","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of aerial-to-aerial short-distance free-space optical links","confLoc":"Herndon, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"a8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099867S","chronDate":"22-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6531925","isNumber":"6548506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531925","xplore-issue":"6548506","articleId":"6548513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6548536,"authors":[{"name":"Paola Pulini","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Paola","lastName":"Pulini","id":"37542470000"},{"name":"Simon Plass","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Plass","id":"37266454000"},{"name":"Lorenzo Taponecco","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Taponecco","id":"37270824400"},{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Morelli","id":"37273534500"},{"name":"Luca Sanguinetti","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sanguinetti","id":"37269450000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6253-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6251-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6252-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-4943"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-4943"}],"articleNumber":"6548536","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548536","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Airports","Aerospace control","OFDM","Encoding","Fading","Poles and towers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic","aircraft","aircraft communication","airports","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AeroMACS evolution","landing phase","take-off phase","approach phase","Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System","operating scenarios","aircraft phase","airport channel model","wireless propagation phenomena","error rate","synchronization analysis","forward link case","airborne channel scenarios","operational phases","airport surface applications"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an investigation on the potential extension of the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) to different operating scenarios is illustrated.

To safely integrate them into the national airspace system (NAS) requires reliable communication links. Since operating conditions and signaling rates of UAS will not always be identical to conventional civil piloted aircraft, the air-ground channel can become a challenging obstacle to reliable communications. Thus, along with NASA's Glenn Research Center we are conducting a measurement and modeling campaign to quantitatively characterize the air-ground channel. This paper describes our motivation, test system, measurement and modeling approach, and some initial results. Use of the developed models within larger network-scale investigations are planned, hence these results are a first step in the UAS integration into the NAS.

The objective of this work is to exploit the commonly understood spatial sparsity in hydrodynamic models and thereby reduce the number of measurements to image a dynamic groundwater profile. To achieve this we employ a Bayesian compressive sensing framework that lets us adaptively select the next measurement to reduce the estimation error. An extension to the Bayesian compressive sensing framework is also proposed which incorporates the additional model information to estimate system states from even lesser measurements. Instead of using cumulative imaging-like measurements, such as those used in standard compressive sensing, we use sparse binary matrices. This choice of measurements can be interpreted as randomly sampling only a small subset of dug wells at each time step, instead of sampling the entire grid. Therefore, this framework offers groundwater surveyors a significant reduction in surveying effort without compromising the quality of the survey.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548732","startPage":"176","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530812/6548700/06548732.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample size reduction in groundwater surveys via sparse data assimilation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sample size reduction in groundwater surveys via sparse data assimilation","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548732/","accessionNumber":"13612779","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548732/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample size reduction in groundwater surveys via sparse data assimilation","confLoc":"Evry, France","sourcePdf":"049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040927S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530812","isNumber":"6548700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530812","xplore-issue":"6548700","articleId":"6548732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6548775,"authors":[{"name":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vorobieva","affiliation":["Renault, Guyancourt, France"],"firstName":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","lastName":"Vorobieva","id":"37064126600"},{"name":"Nicoleta Minoiu-Enache","affiliation":["Renault, Guyancourt, France"],"firstName":"Nicoleta","lastName":"Minoiu-Enache","id":"37070320200"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Glaser","affiliation":["STTAR, LIVIC, Satory, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Glaser","id":"37324054800"},{"name":"Sa\u00efd Mammar","affiliation":["IBISC, Universit\u00e9 d'Evry Val d'Essonne, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Sa\u00efd","lastName":"Mammar","id":"37085493366"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5200-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5198-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5199-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548775","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":952},"abstract":"This paper deals with path planning for car-like vehicle in parallel parking problems. Our path planning method uses simple geometry of the vehicle kinematic model. The presented strategy consists in two parts: create a simple geometric path for the parallel parking in one or more maneuvers, formed by circle arcs and then transform it to a continuous-curvature path with the use of clothoids. Accordingly, a car-like vehicle can follow such path without reorienting its front wheels at stop. The proposed planning method is independent of the initial position and of the orientation of the vehicle. Control inputs for steering angle and longitudinal velocity are generated so that the vehicle can park by following them.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530812/6548700/06548775.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"423","publicationTitle":"2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric continuous-curvature path planning for automatic parallel parking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Wheels","Trajectory","Electronic mail","Splines (mathematics)","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","path planning","road traffic control","steering systems","vehicle dynamics","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric continuous-curvature path planning","parallel parking","car-like vehicle","vehicle kinematic model","circle arc","clothoid","vehicle position","vehicle orientation","control input","steering angle","longitudinal velocity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Geometric continuous-curvature path planning for automatic parallel parking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13612822","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric continuous-curvature path planning for automatic parallel parking","confLoc":"Evry, France","sourcePdf":"108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122201S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530812","isNumber":"6548700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530812","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6548700","articleId":"6548775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6548776,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Cong","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Cong","id":"37605848300"},{"name":"Bart De Schutter","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"De Schutter","id":"37267869100"},{"name":"Robert Babu\u0161ka","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Babu\u0161ka","id":"37270682600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5200-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5198-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5199-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548776","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","linear programming","predictive control","road traffic control","vehicle routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal routing","freeway networks","sequential linear programming","ant colony optimization algorithm","ACO algorithm","optimization method","dynamic traffic routing problem","ant colony routing","model predictive control","control signal","splitting rates","MPC framework","SLP","ACR algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, we previously developed an optimization method to solve the dynamic traffic routing problem in freeway networks, called Ant Colony Routing (ACR).

To overcome the constraint on the knowledge of the system model, local models related to some operating points were used to synthesize a nominal fuzzy type-2 global model. The controller uses integral sliding mode concept and contains two parts. The first one leads to achieve finite time stabilization of the higher order input output dynamics without uncertainties. The second part has the object to reject bounded uncertainties throughout the entire response of the system. In order to eliminate the chattering effect, the sign functions in this part control are substituted by a smooth variation functions. Their structures retain the characteristics of the original functions. The sliding sub-surfaces are computed using a generalized Slotine equation, this choice leads to reduce the relative degree of the system to one, which simplifies the design of the proposed method. The advantages of the controller are that its implementation is easy, the convergence time is chosen in advance and the robustness is ensured.

Since PSO was proposed in 1995 as a kind of swarm intelligence, many improved versions have been developed from different angles. In a swarm, population structures and individual behavior are the key elements for it to evolve. Therefore, in this paper we classify recent PSOs according to their development. Population structures are the foundation of a swarm. Thus some developments are discussed in accordance with the classification of single population and multiple sub-populations. Then the researches on static and dynamic topologies are also reviewed. After that, the improvements on individual behavior control are shown. Finally, some research directions to advance PSO are pointed out.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548790/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13612837","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548790/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recent advances in particle swarm optimization via population structuring and individual behavior control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent advances in particle swarm optimization via population structuring and individual behavior control","confLoc":"Evry, France","sourcePdf":"129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081608S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530812","isNumber":"6548700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530812","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6548700","articleId":"6548790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6548793,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Souissi","affiliation":["LAMIH UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambr\u00e9sis, Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Souissi","id":"37070233000"},{"name":"Artiba Abdelhakim","affiliation":["LAMIH UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambr\u00e9sis, Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Artiba","lastName":"Abdelhakim","id":"37070011800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5200-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5198-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5199-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548793","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two exact methods for mapping on heterogeneous CPU/FPGA architectures","abstract":"This research investigates the problem of the optimisation of static task mapping on a heterogeneous computing system CPU/FPGA (Central Processing Unit/Field-Programmable Gate Array) used to implement intimately coupled hardware and software models. In the face of obstacles as memory-wall, power wall and real-time requirements, hardware designers are directed more and more towards reconfigurable computing. The use of heterogeneous CPU/FPGA systems is one of the most promising solutions in order to increase the performance. Indeed, in such systems, multi-core processors (CPU) provide high computation rates while the reconfigurable logic (FPGA) offers high performance and adaptability to the application real-time constraints. However, heterogeneous computing systems present new challenges, and one of the most important issues is how to map efficiently the application tasks on the available resources while considering real-time constraints. This work includes the development of two exact methods that focus on the static initial task mapping, for two different case studies. In the first case, the execution is considered preemptive and the problem of task mapping is treated in terms of workload on the heterogeneous system. While in the second case the execution is considered non preemptive and the main objective is to minimize the makespan. In both case studies we consider communication constraints, since the application tasks are linked by precedence.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Computational modeling","Program processors","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous CPU-FPGA architecture mapping","central processing unit","field programmable gate array","static task mapping","heterogeneous computing system","memory wall","power wall","reconfigurable computing","multicore processor","reconfigurable logic","makespan minimization","communication constraint"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548793","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548793","startPage":"520","endPage":"525","publicationTitle":"2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530812/6548700/06548793.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548793/","displayDocTitle":"Two exact methods for mapping on heterogeneous CPU/FPGA architectures","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13612840","htmlLink":"/document/6548793/","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two exact methods for mapping on heterogeneous CPU/FPGA architectures","confLoc":"Evry, France","sourcePdf":"132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069291S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530812","isNumber":"6548700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530812","xplore-issue":"6548700","articleId":"6548793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6548818,"authors":[{"name":"Rossella Cancelliere","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Rossella","lastName":"Cancelliere","id":"37352087200"},{"name":"Alberto Gosso","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Gosso","id":"37086796067"},{"name":"Andrea Grosso","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Grosso","id":"37089134466"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5200-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5198-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5199-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548818","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548818","abstract":"This paper uses data collected in a southern Italy wind farm to develop a neural network based prediction of the power produced by each turbine.

In the first one, we classify the unfaulty functioning data of system using the fuzzy-ARTMAP classification in order to model the engine dynamics. In the second stage, a conflict is evaluated between samples of test data based on the hyper-rectangles resulted in the first stage. Two samples are in conflict if their intersection does not belong to the neural model elaborated by fuzzy-ARTMAP. The model is learned and validated using data generated by xMOD software. This tool is also used for test.

In this mode, a voltage regulator is used to reduce the voltage supplied to the core-cell array as low as possible without data loss. Therefore, reliable operation of such device must be ensured by using adequate test techniques. In this work, we propose low area overhead built-in self-test (BIST) and built-in self-repair (BISR) schemes that can be embedded on the SRAM to automatically test and repair the voltage regulator. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed technique for detecting, diagnosing and repairing voltage regulators of low-power SRAMs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13613105","htmlLink":"/document/6548894/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A built-in scheme for testing and repairing voltage regulators of low-power srams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A built-in scheme for testing and repairing voltage regulators of low-power srams","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099979S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530960","isNumber":"6548868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530960","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6548868","articleId":"6548894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6548895,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404169700"},{"name":"Chin-Yuan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Yuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"38241044100"},{"name":"Mango C.-T.

The new SRAM utilizes a data-aware dynamic-supply circuitry cooperating with two write-word-lines to assist the write and an independent read path to enhance the read-SNM. Based on the specific cell structure, we propose a novel test method for the open defects. The test method creates an in-cell self-attacking environment and can detect all the defects undetected by traditional tests in both the SRAM cell and the data-aware dynamic-supply circuitry. Also, the method requires much less test time when being compared to the traditional floating bit-line attacking method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13613106","htmlLink":"/document/6548895/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Testing of a low-V<inf>MIN</inf> data-aware dynamic-supply 8T SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing of a low-V<inf>MIN</inf> data-aware dynamic-supply 8T SRAM","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072365S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530960","isNumber":"6548868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530960","xplore-issue":"6548868","articleId":"6548895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6548905,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Chuan Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Chuan","lastName":"Chi","id":"38181841100"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423200"},{"name":"Min-Jer Wang","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Jer","lastName":"Wang","id":"38184493500"},{"name":"Hung-Chih Lin","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Chih","lastName":"Lin","id":"37070251300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5543-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5542-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5541-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"6548905","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1066},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Maintenance engineering","Substrates","Through-silicon vias","Wires","IEEE standards","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-benefit analysis","design for testability","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit testing","integrated circuit yield","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D-IC interconnect test","3D-IC interconnect diagnosis","3D-IC interconnect repair","through-silicon-via","TSV","3D-IC yield","design-for-test scheme","DIT scheme","faulty interconnects","pinpoint open defect locations","yield learning","cost-benefit analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TSV","3D-IC","interposer","interconnect","test","diagnosis","repair","yield"]}],"abstract":"Through-Silicon-Via (TSV)-based three-dimensional ICs (3D-ICs) have gained increasing attention due to their potential in reducing manufacturing costs and capability of integrating more functionality into a single chip. One of the most important factors that affect 3D-IC yield is the integrity of interconnects which connect different dies in a 3D-IC. This paper proposes a Design-for-Test (DIT) scheme that can 1) detect faulty interconnects in 3D-ICs, 2) pinpoint open defect locations to help yield learning, and 3) repair faulty interconnects caused by open defects to improve the 3D-IC yield. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a diagnosis resolution of 84% for open defects. With the interconnect repair mechanism, the 3D-IC yield is improved by 10%. In addition, cost-benefit analysis reveals that the proposed technique can significantly increase the net profit, especially when the natural interconnect yield is low.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D-IC interconnect test, diagnosis, and repair","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2013.6548905","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530960/6548868/06548905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2013.6548905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"3D-IC interconnect test, diagnosis, and repair","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548905/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13613111","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-IC interconnect test, diagnosis, and repair","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"05B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060775S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530960","isNumber":"6548868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530960","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6548868","articleId":"6548905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6548906,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Hu","affiliation":["ECE Dept., Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085338852"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["ECE Dept., Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5543-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5542-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5541-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"6548906","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Valves","Circuit faults","Biological system modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Logic circuits","Automatic test pattern generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","fault diagnosis","flow control","lab-on-a-chip","logic circuits","logic gates","microchannel flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow-based microfluidic biochips","biochemistry-on-a-chip","clinical diagnostics","biomolecular recognition","screen defective devices","biochemical analysis","fault detection","membrane-based valves","flow control","microchannels","microfluidic device","logic circuit","Boolean gates","ATPG tool"]}],"abstract":"Recent advances in flow-based microfluidics have led to the emergence of biochemistry-on-a-chip as a new paradigm in clinical diagnostics and biomolecular recognition. However, a potential roadblock in the deployment of microfluidic biochips is the lack of test techniques to screen defective devices before they are used for biochemical analysis. Defective chips lead to repetition of experiments, which is undesirable due to high reagent cost and limited availability of samples. Prior work on fault detection in biochips has been limited to digital (\u201cdroplet\u201d) microfluidics and other electrode-based technology platforms. We propose the first approach for automated testing of flow-based microfluidic biochips that are designed using membrane-based valves for flow control. The proposed test technique is based on a behavioral abstraction of physical defects in microchannels and valves. The flow paths and flow control in the microfluidic device are modeled as a logic circuit composed of Boolean gates, which allows us to carry out test generation using standard ATPG tools. The tests derived using the logic circuit model are then mapped to fluidic operations involving pumps and pressure meters in the biochip. Feedback from pressure meters can be compared to expected responses based on the logic circuit model, whereby the types and positions of defects are identified. We show how a fabricated biochip can be tested using the proposed method, and we achieve 100% coverage of faults that model defects in channels and valves.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing of flow-based microfluidic biochips","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2013.6548906","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530960/6548868/06548906.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2013.6548906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"Testing of flow-based microfluidic biochips","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548906/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13613112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing of flow-based microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"05B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076242S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530960","isNumber":"6548868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530960","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6548868","articleId":"6548906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6548910,"authors":[{"name":"Aitzan Sari","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Aitzan","lastName":"Sari","id":"38235623600"},{"name":"Mihalis Psarakis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Mihalis","lastName":"Psarakis","id":"37374522900"},{"name":"Dimitris Gizopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Gizopoulos","id":"37276979600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5543-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5542-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5541-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"6548910","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":512},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining checkpointing and scrubbing in FPGA-based real-time systems","abstract":"SRAM-based FPGAs provide an attractive solution for building high-performance embedded computing systems. Fault tolerant mechanisms are usually implemented in FPGA-based critical systems to improve their vulnerability to transient faults. Most fault tolerant approaches proposed so far in the literature for FPGA systems utilize checkpointing and scrubbing techniques for the fault recovery and repair operations, respectively, and rely on redundancy-based fault detection solutions. In this paper, we study the feasibility of building a low-cost fault-tolerant approach for FPGA-based realtime systems that combines checkpointing and scrubbing, the latter for both fault detection and repair. We calculate the checkpoint frequencies that guarantee the execution of the tasks within their deadlines in the presence of transient faults, taking into consideration the scrubbing time of the FPGA processor. Furthermore, we propose a selective scrubbing approach to reduce the scrubbing time and make feasible the fault tolerant execution of tasks with tight deadlines. We demonstrate the proposed approach in a Leon-3-based SoC in a Virtex-5 FPGA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant

This paper proposes a hybrid error-correcting code (ECC) and redundancy (HEAR) technique to reduce the refresh power of DRAMs in standby mode. The HEAR circuit consists of a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) module and an error-bit repair (EBR) module to raise the error correction capability and minimize the adverse effects caused by the ECC technique such that the refresh period can be effectively prolonged and considerable refresh power reduction can be achieved. Analysis results show that the proposed HEAR scheme can achieve 40~70% of energy saving for a 2Gb DDR3 DRAM in standby mode. The area cost of parity data and ECC circuit of HEAR scheme is only about 63 % and 53 % of that of the ECC-only, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2013.6548927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2013.6548927","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530960/6548868/06548927.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid ECC and redundancy technique for reducing refresh power of DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548927/","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid ECC and redundancy technique for reducing refresh power of DRAMs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13613127","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548927/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid ECC and redundancy technique for reducing refresh power of DRAMs","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"09A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069123S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530960","isNumber":"6548868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530960","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6548868","articleId":"6548927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6548928,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiota Papavramidou","affiliation":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Panagiota","lastName":"Papavramidou","id":"38252175000"},{"name":"Michael Nicolaidis","affiliation":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Nicolaidis","id":"37332469200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5543-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5542-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5541-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"6548928","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided manufacturing","Circuit faults","Maintenance engineering","Error correction codes","Fabrication","Hardware","System-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","iterative methods","random-access storage","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative diagnosis approach","ECC-based memory repair","modern SoC embedded memories","field failures","reliability","high defect densities","single faulty cell","single faulty repair","faulty words","memory test algorithms","single-read double-fault detection property","hardware cost","test length","error-correcting code memory-based memory repair"]}],"abstract":"In modern SoCs embedded memories should be repaired to achieve acceptable yield. They should also be protected by ECC against field failures to achieve acceptable reliability. In technologies affected by high defect densities, conventional repair induce very high costs. To reduce them, we can use ECC to fix words comprising a single faulty cell and repair to fix all other faulty words. However it was shown that, for high defect densities, the diagnosis required for ECC-based repair may induce very large cost. In previous work this issue was fixed by means of new memory test algorithms that exhibit the so-called \u201csingle-read double-fault detection\u201d property.

Nonetheless, due to the scaling of dielectric thickness and the occurring of line-edge roughness, FinFETs may suffer the gate oxide short. Gate oxide short is a defect that has been widely discussed in planar bulk MOSFETs. But for FinFETs, the defect characteristics have not been studied yet. In this paper, we investigate the fault behaviors of the gate oxide short in FinFETs. The investigation includes both tied-gate and independent-gate FinFETs. Based on the TCAD mixed-mode simulations, we discover that the gate oxide short in the two types of FinFETs causes different fault behaviors from each other. Compared to planar bulk MOSFETs, the fault behaviors are even more complex. In addition to the discussion at device level, we also discuss the corresponding SRAM testing. For detecting gate oxide short in FinFET SRAMs, we propose two new test methods. By using TCAD transient simulations, we prove the two methods' test efficacy of detecting the gate oxide shorts uncovered by traditional test methods.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2013.6548929","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530960/6548868/06548929.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2013.6548929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of gate oxide short in FinFETs and the test methods for FinFET SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548929/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of gate oxide short in FinFETs and the test methods for FinFET SRAMs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548929/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13613129","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of gate oxide short in FinFETs and the test methods for FinFET SRAMs","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"09A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079676S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530960","isNumber":"6548868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530960","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6548868","articleId":"6548929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6548934,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Moon","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Tech, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Moon","id":"38252034200"},{"name":"Hyun Woo Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Woo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37403218600"},{"name":"Abhijit Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Tech, USA"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37273696200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5543-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5542-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5541-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"CD","value":"1093-0167"}],"articleNumber":"6548934","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Synchronization","Receivers","Signal resolution","Hardware","Signal reconstruction","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","comparators (circuits)","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit testing","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost multichannel testing","periodic signals","monobit receivers","incoherent subsampling","signal reconstruction","time-variant threshold voltage","amplitude resolution","hardware measurement","FPGA","high-bandwidth clocked-comparators","square waveform","sine wave waveform reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monobit receiver","analog-to-digital conversion","incoherent subsampling","frequency estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548934","abstract":"This paper proposes a new method to reconstruct signal by a monobit receiver based on incoherent subsampling.

In spite of its non-volatility, high density, low standby power, and resilience to soft errors, PCM has a limited write endurance or lifetime, which means that each PCM cell can only be overwritten finite times. More importantly, limited lifetime potentially provides malicious attackers an opportunity to intentionally aggravate write traffic into PCM. In this paper, from the standpoint of attackers, we propose random stream attacks (RSAK) methods for phase change memory used in video applications. Experimental results show that compared to natural video sequences, RSAK incurs higher total write traffic or worsened lifetime. RSAK also gives hints on how to build a more secure PCM in video applications to counter malicious write streams.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RSAK: Random stream attack for phase change memory in video applications","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2013.6548937","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2013.6548937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548868","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 31st VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530960/6548868/06548937.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"RSAK: Random stream attack for phase change memory in video applications","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548937/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13613135","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RSAK: Random stream attack for phase change memory in video applications","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10437S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530960","isNumber":"6548868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530960","xplore-issue":"6548868","articleId":"6548937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6548978,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Sachidananda","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Sachidananda","id":"37070162400"},{"name":"Abdelmajid Khelil","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Abdelmajid","lastName":"Khelil","id":"37300013100"},{"name":"David Noack","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Noack","id":"37407767500"},{"name":"Neeraj Suri","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Suri","id":"37269496000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548978","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"abstract":"A key task in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to deliver specific information about a spatial phenomenon of interest. To this end, a few Sensor Nodes (SNs) sample the phenomenon and transmit the acquired samples, typically multihop, to the application through a gateway called sink. Many applications require the spatial sampling to be accurate and the delivery to be reliable. However, providing a higher accuracy/reliability comes at the cost of higher energy overhead as additional messages are required: increasing the number of samples to increase the accuracy of sampling and increasing the number of retransmissions to increase the transport reliability. Existing design approaches overlook optimized spatial sampling accuracy and transport reliability in combination for minimizing energy consumption. This work aims in providing the optimized solution for sampling accuracy and transport reliability in composition for a maximized efficiency. Our approach features a message efficiency that optimally meets application requirements with the online adaptation and appropriate tradeoff between accuracy and reliability. The sampling and transport co-design proceeds by finding optimal number of SNs for the accuracy of the spatial sampling with the effect of reducing the number of retransmissions and still satisfying the application requirements. We validate the approach viability through analytical modeling and extensive simulations for a wide range of requirements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Accuracy","Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Optimization","Tin","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","sampling methods","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information quality aware co-design","wireless sensor networks","WSN","sensor nodes","gateway","sink","transport reliability","spatial sampling accuracy","energy consumption minimization","message efficiency","online adaptation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Networks","Sampling","Transport","Optimization","Information Quality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548978","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06548978.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information quality aware co-design of sampling and transport in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Information quality aware co-design of sampling and transport in wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548978/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6548978/","accessionNumber":"13628587","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information quality aware co-design of sampling and transport in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064574S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6548978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6548981,"authors":[{"name":"Seunggye Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunggye","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37405508300"},{"name":"Junghun Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junghun","lastName":"Park","id":"37070224400"},{"name":"Dongku Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"},{"name":"Janghoon Yang","affiliation":["Dept of Newmeida, Korean German Institute of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Janghoon","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406103400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548981","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Signal to noise ratio","Compressed sensing","Sparse matrices","Encoding","Measurement uncertainty","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","signal detection","telecommunication channels","telecommunication signalling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR efficient transmission","wireless sensor networks","sampled measurements","compressive sensing based WSN","detection algorithms","sensor selection scheme","signaling channel design","detection performance","sparsity level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Sensor scheduling","Wireless sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sensing(CS) is an emerging technology that can recover a signal from under sampled measurements based on sparsity of the signal in some basis domain. Even though CS associated with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has contributed in developing efficient compression and detection algorithms, most research has focused on detection problem with a simple model without considering properties of physical channels. This paper considers a compressive sensing based WSN, that exploits channel gain to transmit and detect signals efficiently. Assuming that measured signals at each sensor are correlated and sparse at some basis domain, we propose a novel sensor selection scheme and associated signaling channel design to improve detection performance. The simulation results show that the proposed method support reduction in the number of measurmenets by 60~80% for a wide range of sparsity level at high and low SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548981","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06548981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SNR efficient transmission for compressive sensing based wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SNR efficient transmission for compressive sensing based wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548981/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628590","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548981/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNR efficient transmission for compressive sensing based wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056465S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6548981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6548998,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shaqfeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shaqfeh","id":"37392290100"},{"name":"Hussein Alnuweiri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, Qatar"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Alnuweiri","id":"37269837800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6548998","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Switches","Optimization","Fading","Indexes","Wireless communication","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","multiuser channels","optimisation","Rayleigh channels","scheduling","state feedback","switching networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced channel state information feedback","switched diversity scheduling","wireless network","multiuser scheduling scheme","data traffic","feedback threshold optimization","centralized optimization","postuser selection strategy","hybrid switched selection diversity scheme","network capacity","feedback scheduling scheme","Rayleigh fading condition","proportional fairness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["opportunistic scheduling","reduced feed-back","multiuser switched-diversity","proportional fairness"]}],"abstract":"The objective of this paper is to give an overview of switched-diversity scheduling for wireless net-works. This multiuser scheduling scheme is based on one-bit only for the channel information feedback. The reduced feedback causes a slight reduction in the achievable rate per resource unit. Nevertheless, the saved resources for the feedback channel can be used to support more data traffic. We introduce the principle concept of this scheduling scheme, and we point out the main contributions in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss how the feedback thresholds of the users are optimized to maximize the system performance, and we provide a numerical example of the achievable rate region in a two-user scenario. Additionally, we highlight two technical challenges which are centralized optimization and fairness, and we show how these can be completely solved be proper scheduler design to achieve proportional fairness among the users. Moreover, we give some comments on two alternative designs, namely the post-user selection strategy and the hybrid switched-selection diversity scheme. We provide additionally some numerical results to demonstrate that the switched-diversity scheduling scheme operates within 0.3 bits/sec/Hz from the ultimate network capacity of a full feedback scheduling scheme in Rayleigh fading conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06548998.pdf","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser scheduling with reduced channel state information feedback","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548998","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6548998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser scheduling with reduced channel state information feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6548998/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13628607","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6548998/","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser scheduling with reduced channel state information feedback","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071706S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6548998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6549000,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas P\u00f6tsch","affiliation":["Communication Networks, TZI, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"P\u00f6tsch","id":"37063522800"},{"name":"Safdar Nawaz Khan Khan Marwat","affiliation":["Communication Networks, TZI, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Safdar Nawaz Khan","lastName":"Khan Marwat","id":"37086828974"},{"name":"Yasir Zaki","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Yasir","lastName":"Zaki","id":"37704272900"},{"name":"Carmelita Gorg","affiliation":["Communication Networks, TZI, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carmelita","lastName":"Gorg","id":"37300274900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549000","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","Performance evaluation","Load modeling","Logistics","Quality of service","Delays","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M2M communication","LTE system","machine-to-machine communications","cellular mobile networks","traffic characteristics","human-based communication","packet sizes","LTE cellular networks","M2M traffic model","human-based traffic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549000","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of future M2M communication on the LTE system","abstract":"Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications is one of the latest research areas.

M2M traffic is envisaged to play a big role within the coming years; lots of research projects and standardization bodies around the world have already started paying attention to the rising M2M communication. Current cellular mobile networks, such as LTE, are designed and optimized for traffic characteristics of human-based communication, but M2M traffic is different: Packet sizes are small, but transmitted periodically by numerous endpoints. In this paper, we focus on how LTE cellular networks will handle the massive deployment of M2M devices. In order to do so, the authors specified an M2M traffic model that represent a possible logistical scenario in the future. Besides M2M traffic, also regular LTE traffic is present in the network and the influence of the increasing M2M traffic is investigated. The results of the simulations show that M2M traffic will influence regular, human-based traffic.

Accordingly, the femto cell serves indoor traffic activity of femto users, while metro cell serves the outdoor traffic activities as well as the overflow traffic from femto cells. The highest layer in HetNet, macro cell only serves macro users and the overflowed traffic from the lower layer. Then, we develop a realistic teletraffic model in order to measure the performance of the proposed HetNet.

In order to address this issue, mobile operators have adopted static Intercell Interference Coordination (ICIC) strategies, including Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR), given their low complexity and easy implementation. However, recent results made evident the need for additional research efforts as the performance of FFR is poor in realistic cellular deployments. Thus, this paper presents a solution to this problem by means of a novel multiobjective optimization framework able to adapt FFR to any realistic cellular layout. By tuning the operational parameters of FFR at cell level, the proposed scheme succeeds in finding solutions outperforming reference schemes and baseline designs in terms of network capacity and cell edge performance while keeping energy consumption as low as possible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapting fractional frequency reuse to realistic OFDMA cellular networks","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549020","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549020.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adapting fractional frequency reuse to realistic OFDMA cellular networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549020/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628629","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapting fractional frequency reuse to realistic OFDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087148S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6549020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6549021,"authors":[{"name":"Hanaa Marshoud","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, UAE"],"firstName":"Hanaa","lastName":"Marshoud","id":"38529118600"},{"name":"Hadi Otrok","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, UAE"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Otrok","id":"37296104900"},{"name":"Hassan Barada","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, UAE"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Barada","id":"37328742700"},{"name":"Rebeca Estrada","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ecole de Technologie Superieure, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Rebeca","lastName":"Estrada","id":"37603446100"},{"name":"Zbigniew Dziong","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ecole de Technologie Superieure, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Dziong","id":"37344339800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549021","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Bandwidth","Femtocells","Resource management","Macrocell networks","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","genetic algorithms","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","resource allocation","interference mitigation","OFDMA macrocell femtocells networks","base station selection","hybrid access femtocells","femto users","full spectrum sharing","interference threshold","resource optimization problem","power assignments","weighted water filling algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Macrocell","Resource Allocation","Spectrum Sharing","Interference Mitigation","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a base station selection and resource allocation model for OFDMA macro-femtocell networks.

This paper focuses on the design of full-rate space-frequency (SF) codes for improving the performance of distributed-transmission OFDM systems over asynchronous multipath channels. Analyzing the conditional pairwise error probability, we show the achievable diversity order Z for distributed-transmission OFDM systems is upper bounded by the total number of delay paths between M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n transmit antennas and M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n receive antennas. SF codes based on lattice theory are constructed to achieve the diversity order Z. Then, we propose two full-diversity (maximum diversity) SF code design methods. The first method is a cyclic shift coding approach employing different shift lengths for different transmit antennas, and the second method is a cyclic shift superposition coding approach using same shift lengths for different transmit antennas. In order to reduce the decoding complexity while preserving the diversity order, subcarrier grouping based on interleaved partition is performed to the SF codes designed above, which divides all subcarriers into disjoint subsets to carrier different SF code blocks. Moreover, we show that different interleaving methods result in different coding gain due to the effect of the asynchronous delays. Therefore, the detailed design criteria of subcarrier grouping are provided to achieve optimum coding gain. Simulation results show that the proposed full-diversity SF codes induce about 6 dB performance improvement, and optimum subcarrier grouping can achieve 5-9 dB gain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-diversity full-rate space-frequency codes with optimum coding gain for distributed-transmission OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549022","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549022.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Full-diversity full-rate space-frequency codes with optimum coding gain for distributed-transmission OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549022/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628631","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-diversity full-rate space-frequency codes with optimum coding gain for distributed-transmission OFDM systems","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107139S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6549022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6549024,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The considered DL system supports multiuser transmitter preprocessing (MUTP) to mitigate the DL multiuser interference (MUI) at the relay stations (RSs) and mobile stations (MSs). TP employed at the base station (BS) is based on formulating a subspace that is orthogonal to the interfering subspace with the aid of singular value decomposition (SVD). The relays in our considered work support decode and forward (DF) protocol. At the mobile stations (MSs) the user specific signals are combined with the aid of classical maximal ratio combining (MRC) principle. Our simulation study shows that the relay aided DL DS-CDMA system with MVTP achieves better performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) as the DL MUI at the relays is completely eliminated by the preprocessing matrix employed at the BS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative communications aided downlink DS-CDMA with transmitter preprocessing: Performance results","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549025","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549025.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative communications aided downlink DS-CDMA with transmitter preprocessing: Performance results","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549025/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628634","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative communications aided downlink DS-CDMA with transmitter preprocessing: Performance results","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112537S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6549025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549026,"authors":[{"name":"Ashagrie Getnet Flattie","affiliation":["Network Engineering RAN Manager, Ethio Telecom, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"],"firstName":"Ashagrie Getnet","lastName":"Flattie","id":"37070290200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549026","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Principal component analysis","Spread spectrum communication","Downlink","Mobile communication","Loss measurement","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mean square error methods","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity improvement","WCDMA network","predication models","principal component analysis","PCA algorithm","empirical path loss prediction model","MSE","CCIR","WL-NLOS","COST231 Hata models","WCDMA capacity","path loss predication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load factor","Path Loss","PCA","Walfisch-Ikegami","WCDMA"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the coverage and capacity for WCDMA by considering different predication models. Modifications of these models were done by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. The inspiration for PCA algorism is to enhance the accuracy for the existing empirical path loss prediction model. The advantage is that the design capacity of the system is low without greatly compromising prediction accuracy. So the aim of this approach is to increase the capacity without any extra investment in the system. From this study the performance of the models were evaluated by MSE. The result showed that the accuracy of the modified model is satisfactory and hence the capacity of the network is increased. Considering voice users 12.2 kbps, the MSE decreased by 2.48dB, 3.3 dB and 6 dB; the corresponding number of users increased by 13.67 %, 17.5 % and 28.4 % in the modified CCIR, WL-NLOS and COST231 Hata models respectively. The number of 64 kbps voice users is also increased by 20 to 43, on the other hand comparing voice users, 128 kbps data capacity there is not too much increase. In general the result has showed that increasing the accuracy of path loss predication improves WCDMA capacity.","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549026","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549026.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549026","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity improvement for WCDMA network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Capacity improvement for WCDMA network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549026/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549026/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628635","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity improvement for WCDMA network","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06308S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6549026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6549027,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-wook Han","affiliation":["Sch. of ICT, R.

This leads to the issue of providing as much spectrum to CR users as possible while not degrading the quality of service (QoS) of primary users of the spectrum. This paper proposes a novel cooperation scheme between primary and CR users to guarantee QoS of primary users up to the cell edge while making the licensed spectrum available for opportunistic access by the CR users. We suggest that the primary users at the cell edge, who have poor QoS, should allow secondary users to access their spectrum, while at the same time, the secondary users would help to enhance the primary users QoS using superposition coding on the primary users transmissions. Thus the proposed method can provide a so called \u201cwin-win strategy\u201d by benefiting both primary and CR users. The proposed cooperative access scheme in cognitive radios solves efficiently the sum-rate maximization problem on cognitive Gaussian Multiple Access Channels (GMACs) for power allocation of primary systems that cooperates with CR systems in a distributed fashion. We solved the problem using iterative Jacobian method in a distributed manner. Numerical results show that the QoS of primary users at the cell edge is improved by the proposed cooperative access scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549027","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549027.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549027","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power allocation for cooperative access in cognitive radios to guarantee QoS for cell edge primary users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power allocation for cooperative access in cognitive radios to guarantee QoS for cell edge primary users","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549027/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549027/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628636","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power allocation for cooperative access in cognitive radios to guarantee QoS for cell edge primary users","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057071S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6549027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549028,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed El-Bayoumi","affiliation":["Engineering Mathematics department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"El-Bayoumi","id":"37070069900"},{"name":"Maha Elsabrouty","affiliation":["Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Borg El Arab, Egypt"],"firstName":"Maha","lastName":"Elsabrouty","id":"37297463000"},{"name":"Salwa Elramly","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Salwa","lastName":"Elramly","id":"37284145600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549028","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Games","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Cognitive radio","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","radio receivers","radio transmitters","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum resources allocation proposal","centralized system","game theoretic approach","CR","principal technologies","cognitive radio scenarios","secondary users","spectrum owner","licensee","broadcast primary user system","primary user transmitter","multiple primary user receivers","signal to interference plus noise ratio","SINR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Game Theory","Nash Equilibrium","Stackelberg Game","Hierarchical-Access"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is one of the principal technologies aiming to overcome the scarcity of the spectrum.

The lack of a widely used and open source simulation platform has been a hindrance in this regard. In this paper, we present crSimuiator, which is a discrete simulation model for cognitive radio ad hoc networks in OMNeT++. We present the core concepts, major requirements, architectural model of cognitive radio nodes, and the implementation details of crSimulator.

Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc networks are a novel technology that will provide a solution to many communication challenges. This paper investigates the end-to-end performance modelling of a link using quality of service parameters; delay vs. link capacity while considering the factors of spectrum management and node mobility of two nodes in tandem representing a hop in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc networks. We modelled spectrum management and node mobility using the pre-emptive resume priority M/G/1 queuing model and the gated node model respectively. We considered delay aware routing schemes; shortest queue and random probability routing and compared them with the analytical link-capacity for analysis.

PNC takes place at a relay node and exploits the interference caused by incoming signals from the two users to increase throughput.

All three coding schemes perform similarly in a single user system on the AWGN channel with no relay, but results obtained when employing PNC show that although there is an overall degradation in their performance of all three codes, the LDPC code performance is more seriously affected due to the Sum-Product decoding algorithm being less robust to unreliable symbols broadcast from the relay.","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549038","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549038.pdf","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of a physical-layer network coding system with iterative coding schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of a physical-layer network coding system with iterative coding schemes","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549038/","accessionNumber":"13628647","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549038/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of a physical-layer network coding system with iterative coding schemes","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059658S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6549038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6549042,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Khalil","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, College of Signals, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Khalil","id":"38307915000"},{"name":"Adnan Ahmed Khan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, College of Signals, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adnan Ahmed","lastName":"Khan","id":"37536203900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5616-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5615-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5614-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549042","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Cooperative systems","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Turbo codes","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cooperative communication","diversity reception","error statistics","forward error correction","maximum likelihood decoding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo-coded HARQ scheme","multihop cooperative wireless networks","three-node network","multihop-relayed cooperative wireless system","BER performance","single-hop cooperative wireless system","turbo codes","maximum a-posteriori decoding algorithm","MAP decoding algorithm","forward error correction technique","FEC technique","fading environment","overall coding gain","hybrid automatic repeat request protocol","HARQ protocol","retransmission scheme","diversity gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative Wireless System","Hybrid-ARQ","MIMO","Amplify and Forward","Decode and Forward","Turbo Codes"]}],"abstract":"To date, Cooperative wireless systems exist in classical three node network to achieve diversity.

Use of such a powerful coding scheme leads to overall coding gain of the system. To make the system more robust, Hybrid Automatic Repeat re-Quest (HARQ) protocol is also incorporated in the system as retransmission scheme to rectify the errors that are detected at receiver side. Finally integrate all technologies together to enhance the end to end system performance.

The BER of the TPC-LDPC is evaluated for LDPC codes with various rates and sizes using the bit flipping (BF) and sum product (SP) algorithms. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that NSD can provide a remarkable additional coding gain of about 3.5 dB using the BF algorithm as compared to sequential decoding. Moreover, simulation results confirmed that the order of the turbo and LDPC decoding iterations can have a noticeable impact on the BER. Similarly, the NSD of TPC-LDPC codes using the SP algorithm offered noticeable improvement for particular codes.","doi":"10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549045","publicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533891/6548948/06549045.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER performance of turbo product LDPC codes with non-sequential decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"BER performance of turbo product LDPC codes with non-sequential decoding","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13628654","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance of turbo product LDPC codes with non-sequential decoding","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"Paper093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066658S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533891","isNumber":"6548948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533891","xplore-issue":"6548948","articleId":"6549045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6549104,"authors":[{"name":"Haochao Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6814303/6549104/6549104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haochao Li received the MPhil and BEng degrees from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), New Territories, Hong Kong, in 2011 and 2009, respectively.

In traditional point-to-point wireless communication, significant efforts had been made by the existing studies on enhancing the utilization of the channel access time. However, in the emerging wireless network using MU-MIMO, considering only the time domain in channel utilization is not sufficient. As multiple transmitters are allowed to transmit packets simultaneously to the same AP, allowing more antennas at AP would lead to higher channel utilization. Thus, the channel utilization in MU-MIMO should consider both time and spatial domains, i.e., the channel access time and the antenna usage, which have not been considered in the existing methods. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental problem is lacking of the antenna information of contention nodes in channel contention. To address this issue, we propose a new MAC-PHY architecture design, CUTS, to allow distributed nodes effectively contend for the channel and utilize the channel in both domains. Particularly, CUTS adopts interference nulling to attach the antenna information in channel contention. Meanwhile, techniques such as channel contention in frequency domain and ACK in frequency domain using self-jamming are adopted. Through the software defined radio-based real experiments and extensive simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of our design and illustrate that CUTS provides better channel utilization with the gain over IEEE 802.11 reaching up to 470 percent.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6814303/06549104.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1423","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CUTS: Improving Channel Utilization in Both Time and Spatial Domain in WLANs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"CUTS: Improving Channel Utilization in Both Time and Spatial Domain in WLANs","volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6549104/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14299529","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CUTS: Improving Channel Utilization in Both Time and Spatial Domain in WLANs","sourcePdf":"tpds-wu-165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073086S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6814303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6814303","articleId":"6549104","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":6549105,"authors":[{"name":"Jerod J.

Reading scene text is a complex problem involving many details that must be handled effectively for robust, accurate results. In this work, we describe and evaluate a reading system that combines several pieces, using probabilistic methods for coarsely binarizing a given text region, identifying baselines, and jointly performing word and character segmentation during the recognition process.

In existing systems, either the motion models are oversimplified or important factors such as blur kernel and noise level are assumed to be known. Such models cannot capture the intrinsic characteristics that may differ from one sequence to another. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution via simultaneously estimating underlying motion, blur kernel, and noise level while reconstructing the original high-resolution frames. As a result, our system not only produces very promising super resolution results outperforming the state of the art, but also adapts to a variety of noise levels and blur kernels. To further analyze the effect of noise and blur kernel, we perform a two-step analysis using the Cramer-Rao bounds. We study how blur kernel and noise influence motion estimation with aliasing signals, how noise affects super resolution with perfect motion, and finally how blur kernel and noise influence super resolution with unknown motion. Our analysis results confirm empirical observations, in particular that an intermediate size blur kernel achieves the optimal image reconstruction results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","volume":"36","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13973276","pubMedId":"24356354","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6549107/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Bayesian Adaptive Video Super Resolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Bayesian Adaptive Video Super Resolution","sourcePdf":"ttp2014020346.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105364S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6687161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"6687161","articleId":"6549107","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6549108,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Krieger","affiliation":["Microwaves and Radar Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR), We\u00dfling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6750044/6549108/6549108-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerhard Krieger (M'04\u2013s'09\u2013F'13) received the Dipl.-Ing.

These advanced architectures have been dubbed multiple-input multiple-output SAR (MIMO-SAR) in analogy to MIMO communication systems. Considerable confusion arose, however, with regard to the selection of suitable waveforms for the simultaneous transmission via multiple channels. It is shown that the mere use of orthogonal waveforms is insufficient for the desired performance improvement in view of most SAR applications. As a solution to this fundamental MIMO-SAR challenge, a new class of short-term shift-orthogonal waveforms is introduced. The short-term shift orthogonality avoids mutual interferences from the radar echoes of closely spaced scatterers, while interferences from more distant scatterers are suppressed by digital beamforming on receive in elevation. Further insights can be gained by considering the data acquisition of a side-looking imaging radar in a 3-D information cube. It becomes evident that the suggested waveforms fill different subspaces that can be individually accessed by a multichannel receiver. For completeness, the new class of short-term shift-orthogonal waveforms is also compared to a recently proposed pair of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveforms. It is shown that both sets of waveforms require essentially the same principle of range time to elevation angle conversion via a multichannel receiver in order to be applicable for MIMO-SAR imaging without interference.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote

compares cell current with reference current to identify data that are programmed. The S/A for 0 (erased) cell data consumes a large sink current, which is greater than off-current for 1 (programmed) cell data. This brief proposes a built-in write/read path based on binary inversion methods to reduce the sensing current of S/A. An original binary code is programmed into flash memory with an inverted binary code based on the proposed bit inversion techniques. The de-inversion hardware, which is implemented with small logic gates to restore original binary data, only consumes logic current instead of analog sink current in the S/A. The proposed techniques are evaluated for the DSPStone benchmark and are applied to the modified S/A for ARM Cortex-M3-based microcontroller with 128-kB on-chip flash memory based on a 0.18-um EEPROM technology. The circuit-level simulation result for the DSPStone benchmark shows that a newly implemented chip with the S/A based on the proposed technique consumes approximately less than 22% of the operating power that conventional S/A uses.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2265894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2265894","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6803904/06549111.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Built-In Binary Code Inversion Technique for On-Chip Flash Memory Sense Amplifier With Reduced Read Current Consumption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Built-In Binary Code Inversion Technique for On-Chip Flash Memory Sense Amplifier With Reduced Read Current Consumption","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549111/","accessionNumber":"14252219","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549111/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ABOV Semiconductor for chip fabrication"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Built-In Binary Code Inversion Technique for On-Chip Flash Memory Sense Amplifier With Reduced Read Current Consumption","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-park-2265894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050309S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6803904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6803904","articleId":"6549111","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6549117,"authors":[{"name":"Qunbi Zhuge","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Qunbi Zhuge was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1987.

Mechanical damages of the stranded bare conductors can locally degrade the effective sizing of the cross section and cause anomalous local conditions. The circuit protective devices (PDs) can be unfit to detect the faults of cords that remain so energized and available to electric shock and fire hazards. Some fire ignitions result from these types of special unprotected faults. To highlight the local incident energy in case of fault, this paper introduces the parameters steady and transient current densities that assist in analyzing these fault events. Efficient protection can be achieved by the integration of active and passive techniques: adopting arc-fault circuit interrupters or detection devices, recognizing arcing faults, and wiring circuits with a grounding protection conductor to involve the ground in every fault that, in ac systems, is rapidly protected by residual current PDs (or ground-fault PDs). At this aim, the use of special cables, namely, ground-fault-forced cables, is recommended, particularly for cords and extension cords also supplying Class II equipment. The dc system protection requires special care.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2013.2271605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6714460/06549131.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2013.2271605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6714460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unprotected Faults of Electrical and Extension Cords in AC and DC Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549131/","displayDocTitle":"Unprotected Faults of Electrical and Extension Cords in AC and DC Systems","volume":"50","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549131/","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14032750","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unprotected Faults of Electrical and Extension Cords in AC and DC Systems","sourcePdf":"tia-parise-2271605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049733S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6714460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6714460","articleId":"6549131","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6549140,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6549140/6549140-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eric Monmasson (M'96\u2013SM'06) received the Ing. and Ph.D. degrees from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs d'Electrotechnique, Electronique, Informatique et Hydraulique de Toulouse (ENSEEIHT), Toulouse, France, in 1989 and 1993, respectively.

The density increase of the FPGA's internal resources has also allowed integrating several processor cores within a single component, leading to (Multiple Programmable) System-on-Chip designs. In 2011, Monmasson et al. [IEEE Ind. Electron. Mag., vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 14-26, Mar. 2011] discussed the potential benefits of an FPGA-based controller compared to a standard software solution, from the final industrial application perspective. The paper demonstrates that a single chip reconfigurable hardware platform can constitute a solution which addresses the main control challenges posed by power electronic and drive applications. Some of these challenges are: i) handling capability for the inherent parallelism of multilevel and interleaved power converter structures; ii) design a quasi-analog controller with no computational delay; iii) ensure a perfect synchronism between several required sampling actions; iv) enhance the sampling rate of a regulation; and v) include additional tasks to the embedded controller (such as prediction, health monitoring and diagnosis). This Special Section on Industrial Control Applications of FPGAs of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS constitutes a fresh opportunity to collate research papers summarizing novel solutions to the aforementioned challenges, resulting from the ongoing intensive research carried out by the industrial electronics community. After a thorough review process 13 papers were finally selected. They are classified by main topic of interest into three groups: i) drive applications; ii) power electronic applications; and iii) design methods. These papers are briefly summarized.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2013.2270011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2013.2270011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6582568/06549140.pdf","startPage":"1250","endPage":"1252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Guest Editorial Special Section on Industrial Control Applications of FPGAs","volume":"9","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549140/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guest Editorial Special Section on Industrial Control Applications of FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tii-monmasson-2270011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050015S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6582568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6582568","articleId":"6549140","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549144,"authors":[{"name":"Sarah S.

The resistive-load-dependent voltage gains and efficiencies are derived along with the peak efficiencies and open circuit voltage gains. The models of efficiency and voltage gain are compared to the experimental measurements of fabricated PZT-on-silicon piezoelectric transformers with 2, 4, and 10 \u03bcm of device silicon. The resonant frequencies of the devices range between 14 and 19 MHz. Peak efficiencies as high as 62% are measured and open circuit voltage gains as high as 5.7 are extracted from the measurements. The measured efficiencies with 50- \u03a9 loads compare within 14% of the models on average (25% peak error). The extracted open-circuit voltage gains and their models compare within 22% on average (67% peak error).

Extracting such a wide range of features to represent the optical remote sensing images, beyond edge primitives, is a long-standing goal in the remote sensing and vision research community. The recently proposed deconvolution network (DN) can effectively learn and capture features in a variety of forms: low-level edges, midlevel edge junctions, high-level object parts, and complete objects. The approach is based on the convolutional decomposition of images under an L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n sparsity constraint. Unfortunately, the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n regularizer cannot enforce further sparsity, hence limiting the practical efficacy of the DN in optical remote sensing representation and processing. In this paper, we extend the DN by incorporating the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sub>\n sparsity constraint, which we name the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sub>\n-DN. The L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sub>\n regularizer not only induces sparsity but is also a better choice among L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</sub>\n, (0<;q<;1) regularizers. Furthermore, the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sub>\n-DN algorithm is more efficient, provides a sparser representation, and results in more accurate recovery than the DN.

This contrasts with the notion that words are simply mapped \u201conto\u201d previously existing categories. To investigate the computational foundations of a system in which word and object categories develop simultaneously and in an interactive fashion, we present a model of word learning based on interacting self-organizing maps that represent the auditory and visual modalities, respectively. While other models of lexical development have employed similar dual-map architectures, our model uses active Hebbian connections to propagate activation between the visual and auditory maps during learning. Our results show that categorical perception emerges from these early audio-visual interactions in both domains. We argue that the learning mechanism introduced in our model could play a role in the facilitation of infants' categorization through verbal labeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549156/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13969726","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Cross-Modal Interactions in Early Word Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Cross-Modal Interactions in Early Word Learning","sourcePdf":"tamd-althaus-2264858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164779S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"6679736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6679736","articleId":"6549156","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549160,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Jen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung-Li, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221020/6701130/6549160/6549160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yao-Jen Chang received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1992.","He is currently a Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan.

Trajectories are modeled as a discrete-time series of axis-parallel constraints (\u201cboxes\u201d) in the 2-D space. The anomaly can be estimated by considering two trajectories, where one trajectory is the current movement pattern and the other is a weighted trajectory collected from N norms. The proposed system was implemented and evaluated with eight individuals with cognitive impairments. The experimental results showed that recall was 95.0% and precision was 90.9% on average without false alarm suppression. False alarms and false negatives dropped when axis rotation was applied. The precision with axis rotation was 97.6% and the recall was 98.8%. The average time used for sending locations, running anomaly detection, and issuing warnings was in the range of 15.1-22.7 s. Our findings suggest that the ability to adapt anomaly detection devices for appropriate timing of self-alerts will be particularly important.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2013.2271695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/6701130/06549160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2013.2271695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701130","startPage":"384","endPage":"390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Anomaly Detection for Individuals With Cognitive Impairments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Anomaly Detection for Individuals With Cognitive Impairments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998764","pubMedId":"24403438","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6549160/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Anomaly Detection for Individuals With Cognitive Impairments","sourcePdf":"jbhi-chang-2271695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080302S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6701130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6701130","articleId":"6549160","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6549162,"authors":[{"name":"Shigen Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6670533/6549162/6549162-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shigen Gao received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation from Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 2009.

It makes use of the zero-crossing characteristics of the multifrequency sinusoid signals, to collect valid samples in unsaturated parts of the signals. On these valid samples, the amplitudes and phases of the specific original ac sensing signals can be linearly computed by applying the least square method. The simulation results show that the proposed method has satisfactory accuracy even with very large saturation ( ~ 10 times of the saturation limit) and large dc offset, which frees us from the restriction to avoid the signal saturation problem in the signal acquisition. The method is realized by the software algorithm, and no longer requires the common used hardware-the phase sensitive detection circuit. Hence when it is applied to the magnetic coupling system, we will obtain much simpler system composition, higher accuracy, and high execution speed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2271673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6609078/06549163.pdf","startPage":"4569","endPage":"4575","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2271673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovering Amplitudes and Phases From Saturated Multifrequency Sinusoid Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Recovering Amplitudes and Phases From Saturated Multifrequency Sinusoid Signals","volume":"13","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6549163/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796338","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovering Amplitudes and Phases From Saturated Multifrequency Sinusoid Signals","sourcePdf":"jsen-qu-2271673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069364S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6609078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6609078","articleId":"6549163","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6549167,"authors":[{"name":"Alaa R.

Conventional read stability metrics cannot accurately estimate the read failure probability as technology scales down, because some metrics cannot characterize read stability and others can no longer be approximated to a known distribution. We first introduce a one-sided static noise margin (OSNM), whose lower tail region follows a Gaussian distribution, and also propose a Gaussian-tail-fitting method that properly models the distribution of the OSNM at the tail region. It is demonstrated that the OSNM can accurately estimate the SRAM cell yield using the proposed Gaussian-tail-fitting method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-Sided Static Noise Margin and Gaussian-Tail-Fitting Method for SRAM","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2268543","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2268543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6819107/06549169.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"One-Sided Static Noise Margin and Gaussian-Tail-Fitting Method for SRAM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6549169/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14319009","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IT R&D program of MKE/KEIT","grantNumber":"10039174"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-Sided Static Noise Margin and Gaussian-Tail-Fitting Method for SRAM","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jung-2268543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086421S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6819107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6819107","articleId":"6549169","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6549171,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of Network Coding, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaojun Yuan (S'04\u2013M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, 2008.

In the proposed scheme, the overall signal space at the relay is divided into two subspaces. In one subspace, the spatial streams of the two users have nearly orthogonal directions and are completely decoded at the relay. In the other subspace, the signal directions of the two users are nearly parallel, and linear functions of the spatial streams are computed at the relay, following the principle of physical-layer network coding. Based on the recovered messages and message-functions, the relay generates and forwards network-coded messages to the two users. We show that, at high signal-to-noise ratio, the proposed scheme achieves the asymptotic sum-rate capacity of the MIMO TWRC within [ 1/ 2]log(5/4) \u2248 0.161 bits per user-antenna, for any antenna configuration and any channel realization. We perform large-system analysis to derive the average sum-rate of the proposed scheme over Rayleigh-fading MIMO TWRCs. We show that the average asymptotic sum-rate gap to the capacity is at most 0.053 bits per relay-antenna. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6595627/06549171.pdf","startPage":"6421","endPage":"6440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2271632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2271632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Two-Way Relaying: A Space-Division Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Uplink","Antennas","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","MIMO communication","network coding","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay-antenna","average asymptotic sum-rate gap","Rayleigh-fading MIMO TWRC","large-system analysis","channel realization","antenna configuration","asymptotic sum-rate capacity","signal-to-noise ratio","network-coded messages","message-functions","recovered messages","physical-layer network coding","signal directions","decoding","orthogonal directions","spatial streams","multiantenna relay","multiantenna users","MIMO two-way relay channels","space-division-based network-coding scheme","multiple-input multiple-output two-way relaying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","physical-layer network coding","space-division precoding","two-way relay channel (TWRC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Two-Way Relaying: A Space-Division Approach","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6549171/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13767494","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Two-Way Relaying: A Space-Division Approach","sourcePdf":"tit-yuan-2271632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116486S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6549171","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549172,"authors":[{"name":"Luigi Cappelli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Latium, Cassino, Frosinone, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6637065/6549172/6549172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luigi Cappelli (S'13) was born in Cassino, Italy, in 1985.

This proposed secondary-modulation technique naturally clamps the voltage across the primary-side devices with zero-current commutation, eliminating the necessity for active-clamp circuit or passive snubbers. Switching losses are reduced significantly owing to zero-current switching of primary-side devices and zero-voltage switching of secondary-side devices. Soft switching and voltage clamping are inherent and load independent. The voltage across primary-side devices is independent of duty cycle with varying input voltage and output power and clamped at rather low reflected output voltage, enabling the use of semiconductor devices of low voltage rating. These merits make the converter promising for fuel cell vehicles application, front-end dc/dc power conversion for fuel cell inverters, and energy storage.

Underwater acoustic communication systems use a bandwidth that is not small compared with the center frequency of the signal and qualify as ultrawideband (UWB) in a relative sense. In this paper, measurements and analysis of acoustic propagation effects demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowband channel models. These effects are frequency-dependent fluctuation rates and frequency-dependent attenuation, where the frequency dependence of the attenuation differs between paths. This frequency selectivity of the medium violates the assumption of uncorrelated taps and requires a UWB channel model.

The IEC flickermeter generally performs well for incandescent lamps. However, it fails to measure the flicker of non-incandescent lamps caused by some ranges of interharmonics. This paper suggests modifying the existing IEC flickermeter by adding a new block to it in order to enable accurate measurement of the flicker caused by high-frequency interharmonics. A digital implementation of the proposed modified flickermeter is tested, showing encouraging results. The error of the modified flickermeter is very low compared to the original one, even for the worst conditions. The changes implemented in the flickermeter do not affect its regular performance measuring incandescent lamp flicker due to amplitude modulation, making it a more generic flickermeter version. An arc furnace simulated by PSCAD/EMTDC is used to check the performance of this flickermeter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549218/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13810350","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Flickermeter to Measure Non-Incandescent Lamps Flicker","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Flickermeter to Measure Non-Incandescent Lamps Flicker","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-hooshyar-2267153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068646S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6605682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6605682","articleId":"6549218","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":6549230,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6607263/6549230/6549230-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Zhang (S'89-SM'98) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, the M.S. degree from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, all in electrical engineering and computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science (Electrical Engineering-Systems) from The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.","He is currently an Associate Professor and the Founding Director of the Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station.

In this paper, we investigate such a tradeoff and show how average power increases as delay-bound requirement for wireless network traffics becomes stringent. Specifically, we propose the resource allocation schemes to minimize the power consumption subject to a delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, where the delay constraint is in terms of queue-length decay rate when an arrival traffic is transmitted through the wireless networks. We focus on orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) communications under three different network infrastructures, namely, point-to-point link, multihop amplify-and-forward (AF) network, and multiuser cellular network. We derive the optimal resource allocation policies for each scenario, and compare their performances with other existing resource-allocation policies. The obtained simulation and numerical results show that using our proposed optimal resource-allocation policies, significant power saving can be achieved. Furthermore, our OFDM-based communications systems can significantly reduce the power consumption, especially under stringent delay constraint.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.120001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607263","startPage":"3673","endPage":"3684","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6607263/06549230.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Delay Tradeoff over Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549230/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power-Delay Tradeoff over Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2013","accessionNumber":"13795202","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Delay Tradeoff over Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"3673-tc1309-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068878S","chronDate":"September  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6607263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6607263","articleId":"6549230","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6549233,"authors":[{"name":"Qiaoyu Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering and the National Key Laboratory of CNS, ATM, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6583513/6549233/6549233-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiaoyu Li (S'13) received the B.E. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering (as Outstanding Bachelor Graduate) from Beihang University (Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, BUAA) in 2010.

However, since this MAP detector requires a prohibitively high computational complexity, low-complexity suboptimal detectors are desirable. In this paper, lattice reduction (LR)-based MIMO detection is investigated to derive a low-complexity detector that can achieve near MAP performance for IDD. In order to approximate LLR values incorporating the extrinsic information provided by a soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder, bit-wise LR-based minimum mean square error (MMSE) filters are derived. Furthermore, in order to minimize the performance degradation due to quantization (or rounding) errors in the LR-based detection, a low-complexity integer perturbed list generation method is proposed, where no tree search is used by taking advantage of a near orthogonal channel basis obtained by LR. Through a complexity analysis and simulations, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves near optimal performance, while the complexity is comparable with that of the MMSE soft cancellation method, which is known to be computationally efficient. As a bit-wise detector, a parallel implementation of the proposed method would be straightforward, which lowers the detection delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549233/","accessionNumber":"13707175","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Reduction-Based Approximate MAP Detection with Bit-Wise Combining and Integer Perturbed List Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Reduction-Based Approximate MAP Detection with Bit-Wise Combining and Integer Perturbed List Generation","sourcePdf":"3259-tc1308-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079756S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6583513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6583513","articleId":"6549233","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6549234,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6583513/6549234/6549234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiyong Wang received the B.E. degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2009.

Then, a suboptimal but low-complexity receiver is proposed. The effect of imbalances between In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) branches is carefully examined. To combat the performance loss due to IQ imbalances, monobit receivers based on double training sequences and eight-sector phase quantization are proposed. Numerical simulations show that the low-complexity suboptimal receiver suffers 3dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) loss in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and only 1dB SNR loss in multipath channels compared with matched-filter monobit receiver with perfect channel state information (CSI). It is further demonstrated that the amplitude imbalance has essentially no effect on monobit receivers. In AWGN channels, receivers based on double training sequences can efficiently compensate for the SNR loss without complexity increase, while receivers with eight-sector phase quantization can almost completely eliminate the SNR loss caused by IQ imbalances. In dense multipath channels, the effect of imbalances on monobit receivers is slight.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.120304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6583513/06549234.pdf","startPage":"3292","endPage":"3303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.120304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monobit Digital Receivers for QPSK: Design, Performance and Impact of IQ Imbalances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549234/","displayDocTitle":"Monobit Digital Receivers for QPSK: Design, Performance and Impact of IQ Imbalances","volume":"61","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13707176","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549234/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monobit Digital Receivers for QPSK: Design, Performance and Impact of IQ Imbalances","sourcePdf":"3292-tc1308-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079598S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6583513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6583513","articleId":"6549234","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6549235,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Hager","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6583513/6549235/6549235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Hager (S'11) was born in 1986 in Volkmarsen, Germany.

Fountain codes are capacity achieving erasure codes designed for point-to-point transmissions. NC is a throughput-optimal data dissemination technique, but its high-complexity decoding makes it unattractive for applications where limited resources are available. In this paper, we consider Fountain network coding to take advantage of efficient fountain decoders. Protocols such as Soliton-like rateless coding (SLRC) have previously addressed this issue, yet the re-encoding at the relay is expensive while there is still room for improving the performance. Extending SLRC, we propose the Improved Soliton-like Rateless Coding (ISLRC) protocol, where the relay is designed to perform distribution shaping given limited resources. ISLRC preserves the same properties as SLRC, but also makes the aggregate degree distribution more efficient for Fountain decoding. We analyze ISLRC's degree distribution and perform an asymptotic error analysis for the case where resources are most scarce. The ISLRC scheme is compared against other existing schemes. Simulation results show that even under the worst-case scenario of ISLRC, better performance can be achieved compared to SLRC and other existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.110585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6583513/06549237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.110585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583513","startPage":"3327","endPage":"3335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Low-Complexity Soliton-Like Network Coding for a Resource-Limited Relay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Low-Complexity Soliton-Like Network Coding for a Resource-Limited Relay","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13707177","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Low-Complexity Soliton-Like Network Coding for a Resource-Limited Relay","sourcePdf":"3327-tc1308-liao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091007S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6583513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6583513","articleId":"6549237","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6549238,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Similar to standard image compression, the scheme includes a linear transform followed by successive refinement scalar quantization. Unlike conventional schemes, though, in the proposed system the quantized transform coefficients are linearly mapped into channel symbols using systematic linear encoders. This fixed-to-fixed length \"linear index coding\" approach avoids the use of an explicit entropy coding stage (e.g., arithmetic or Huffman coding), which is typically fragile to channel post-decoding residual errors. We use linear codes over GF(4), which are particularly suited for this application, since they are matched to the dead-zone quantizer symbol alphabet and to the QPSK modulation used on the deep-space communication channel. We optimize the proposed system where the linear codes are systematic Raptor codes over GF(4). The rateless property of Raptor encoders allows to implement a \"continuum\" of coding rates, in order to accurately match the channel coding rate to the transmission channel capacity and to the quantized source entropy rate for each transform subband and refinement level.

We analyse the call-level performance of an OCDMA Passive Optical Network (PON) configuration, which accommodates multiple service-classes with finite traffic source population. The considered user activity is in accordance with the bursty nature of traffic, so that calls may alternate between active (steady transmission of a burst) and passive states (no transmission at all). Parameters related to multiple access interference, additive noise, user activity and number of traffic sources are incorporated to our analysis, which is based on a two-dimensional Markov chain. An approximate recursive formula is derived for efficient calculation of call blocking probability. Furthermore, we determine the burst blocking probability; burst blocking occurs when a burst delays its returning from passive to active state. The accuracy of the model is completely satisfactory and is verified through simulation.

Our general objective formulation leads to a challenging mixed integer programming problem that is hard to solve. To make it computationally tractable, we employ a time-sharing method to transform it into a non-linear fractional programming problem, which can be further converted into an equivalent convex optimization problem by using its hypogragh form. Based on these transformations, it is possible to obtain (near) optimal solution by standard optimization technique. However, the complexity of the standard technique is too high for this real-time optimization task. By exploiting the structure of the problem extensively, we develop an efficient barrier method to work out the (near) optimal solution with a reasonable complexity, significantly better than the standard technique. Numerical results show that our proposal can maximize the energy efficiency of the CR system, whilst the proposed algorithm performs quickly and stably.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.120878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6583513/06549244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.120878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583513","startPage":"3181","endPage":"3191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13707183","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549244/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3181-tc1308-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111539S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6583513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6583513","articleId":"6549244","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6549245,"authors":[{"name":"Jurgen Freudenberger","affiliation":["Institute for System Dynamics, Hochschule\u00a0Konstanz University of Applied Sciences, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6583513/6549245/6549245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["J\u00fcrgen Freudenberger received the Dipl.Ing. and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Ulm, Germany, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.

We introduce Gaussian integer rings which extend the number of possible signal constellations over Gaussian integer fields. Many well-known code constructions can be used for codes over Gaussian integer rings, e.g., the Plotkin construction or product codes. These codes enable low complexity decoding in the complex domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the concept of set partitioning can be applied to Gaussian integers. This enables multilevel code constructions. In addition to the code constructions, we present a low complexity soft-input decoding algorithm for one Mannheim error correcting codes. The presented decoding method is based on list decoding, where the list of candidate codewords is obtained by decomposing the syndrome into two sub-syndromes. Considering all decompositions of the syndrome we construct lists of all possible errors of Mannheim weight two. In the last decoding step the squared Euclidean distance is used to select the best codeword from the list. Simulation results for the additive white Gaussian noise channel demonstrate that the proposed decoding method achieves a significant coding gain compared with hard-input decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.120742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.061913.120742","startPage":"3114","endPage":"3124","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6583513/06549245.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Coding Techniques for Codes over Gaussian Integers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","displayDocTitle":"New Coding Techniques for Codes over Gaussian Integers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","volume":"61","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549245/","accessionNumber":"13707184","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549245/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Coding Techniques for Codes over Gaussian Integers","sourcePdf":"3114-tc1308-jurgen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106232S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6583513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6583513","articleId":"6549245","onlineDate":"28 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6549274,"authors":[{"name":"Kuor-Hsin Chang","affiliation":["Elster Solutions, LLC, USA"],"firstName":"Kuor-Hsin","lastName":"Chang","id":"37070570300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1284"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0687"}],"articleNumber":"6549274","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"A truly smart grid will improve the reliability of the overall electrical network, reduce the cost of power distribution, reduce carbon emissions, and lower energy consumption, thereby reducing utility bills for end users.

Cloud facilities enable mobile devices-clients to offload their tasks to remote cloud servers, giving birth to Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). The challenge for the cloud is to minimize the task execution and data transfer time to the user, whose location changes due to mobility. However, providing quality of service guarantees is particularly challenging in the dynamic MCC environment, due to the time-varying bandwidth of the access links, the ever changing available processing capacity at each server and the timevarying data volume of each virtual machine. In this article, we advocate the need for novel cloud architectures and migration mechanisms that effectively bring the computing power of the cloud closer to the mobile user. We consider a cloud computing architecture that consists of a back-end cloud and a local cloud, which is attached to wireless access infrastructure (e.g. LTE base stations). We outline different classes of task migration policies, spanning fully uncoordinated ones, in which each user or server autonomously makes its migration decisions, up to the cloud-wide migration strategy of a cloud provider. We conclude with a discussion of open research problems in the area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Migrate or not? exploiting dynamic task migration in mobile cloud computing systems","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6549280","startPage":"24","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6549280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6549270/06549280.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Migrate or not? exploiting dynamic task migration in mobile cloud computing systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6549280/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13599249","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Migrate or not? exploiting dynamic task migration in mobile cloud computing systems","sourcePdf":"010GZATZIKIS.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033489S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6549270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"6549270","articleId":"6549280","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6549281,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Lei","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lei Lei received a B.S. degree in 2001 and a Ph.D. degree in 2006, respectively, from Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China, both in telecommunications engineering.

Heterogeneous Network (HetNet), which has multiple types of low power radio access nodes in addition to the traditional macrocell nodes in a wireless network, is widely accepted as a promising way to satisfy the unrelenting traffic demand. In this article, we first introduce the framework of HetNet for MCC, identifying the main functional blocks. Then, the current state of the art techniques for each functional block are briefly surveyed, and the challenges for supporting MCC applications in HetNet under our proposed framework are discussed. We also envision the future for MCC in HetNet before drawing the conclusion.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6549281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6549270/06549281.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6549281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges on wireless heterogeneous networks for mobile cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Challenges on wireless heterogeneous networks for mobile cloud computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549281/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13599250","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges on wireless heterogeneous networks for mobile cloud computing","sourcePdf":"011ZHENG.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085002S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6549270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6549270","articleId":"6549281","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6549282,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Xu","affiliation":["Auburn University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yi Xu [S'11] (yzx0010@tigermail.auburn.edu) received the M.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2010 and the B.S. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China in 2007.

The gap between the traffic demand and the link capacity, along with time-varying link conditions, results in poor service quality of video streaming services over the mobile networks, such as intermittent disruptions and long buffering delays. Leveraging the current cloud computing technology, we propose and discuss a framework to improve the quality of video services for mobile users, which includes two parts: cloud-assisted adaptive video streaming, and social-aware video prefetching. For each active mobile user, a private agent is constructed in the cloud center to adaptively adjust the video quality (bit rate) by the scalable video coding technique based on the feedback of link condition. Meanwhile, the online social network interactions among mobile users are monitored by the cloud-based agents, so that the videos that are shared among users will be effectively prefetched to mobile users in advance. The adaptability of the video streaming and the effectiveness of the social-aware prefetching supported by the cloud computing are evaluated based on a prototype implementation of the framework.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6549285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6549270/06549285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6549285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549270","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud-assisted adaptive video streaming and social-aware video prefetching for mobile users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-assisted adaptive video streaming and social-aware video prefetching for mobile users","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13599254","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549285/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-assisted adaptive video streaming and social-aware video prefetching for mobile users","sourcePdf":"015KWON.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047901S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6549270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6549270","articleId":"6549285","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549287,"authors":[{"name":"Quang-Dung Ho","affiliation":["Mcgill University, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Quang-dung Ho received his B.

Most of the existing OSA protocols, albeit theoretically sound with almost optimal performance, have to require the preknowledge of static known distributions under stochastic channels. These assumptions, however, make them impractical for more general application scenarios where channel statistics may not be readily available a priori and channel availabilities cannot be modeled as a stochastic process due to malicious jamming. More seriously, the existing OSA protocols are subject to malicious jamming attacks. That is, a cognitive jammer can always disrupt the legitimate network communication by leveraging the publicly-available channel statistic information to effectively jam the channels and thus lead to serious spectrum underutilization. In this article, we first present an in-depth overview of the existing spectrum sensing and access protocols under stochastic channels, achieving almost optimal performance in jamming- free scenarios. We then analyze the vulnerabilities of these protocols to malicious jamming attacks. Finally, we discuss spectrum sensing and access protocols under non-stochastic channels and show their robustness and resilience against various malicious jamming attacks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6549292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6549270/06549292.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6549292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic spectrum access: from stochastic channels to non-stochastic channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic spectrum access: from stochastic channels to non-stochastic channels","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6549292/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13599261","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic spectrum access: from stochastic channels to non-stochastic channels","sourcePdf":"022REN.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052838S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6549270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6549270","articleId":"6549292","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549295,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Bing Lin","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University and Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Yi-bing Lin [m'96, Sm'96, F'03 is Vice President and Chair professor of College of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), an adjunct research fellow of llS, Academia Sinica, and a Visiting professor of King Saud University.

Moreover, the guaranteed spectral efficiency is shown to increase with bandwidth, i.e. the guaranteed data-rate increases better than linearly with bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6672050/06549314.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2013.061913.130380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2013.061913.130380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672050","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive OFDM for Wireless Interconnect in Confined Enclosures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Computers","Adaptive systems","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive OFDM","wireless interconnect","confined enclosures","adaptive subcarrier modulation","wireless UWB communication","computer chassis","rigorous measurement campaign","guaranteed spectral efficiency","WiMedia OFDM systems","guaranteed data rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","ultrawideband","adaptive OFDM","wireless interconnect","computer chassis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive OFDM for Wireless Interconnect in Confined Enclosures","volume":"2","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6549314/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918102","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive OFDM for Wireless Interconnect in Confined Enclosures","sourcePdf":"507-wcl1310-sipal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060132S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6672050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6672050","articleId":"6549314","onlineDate":"01 July 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549315,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403981600"},{"name":"Rui Yin","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Yin","id":"37407958600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6549315","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":862},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Signal to noise ratio","Physical layer","Downlink","Interference","Vectors","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","feedback","radio transmitters","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","physical layer security","limited CSI feedback","eavesdropper channel","secrecy rate","quantitative analysis","ergodic secrecy sum-rate","multiuser multiantenna downlink networks","asymptotic characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","CSI feedback","ergodic secrecy sum-rate","asymptotic characteristics"]}],"abstract":"Channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is of importance to the performance of physical layer security based on multi-antenna networks.

An exploratory experiment was conducted in a fixed-based simulator with eight pi-lots. The common, static triple display was tested against a single display augmented with amplified head pitch and yaw rotations. Participants started airborne in a visual circuit pattern and performed a base-to-final turn and full stop landing whilst keeping a visual scan for traffic in the vicinity. Results showed that there was a significant difference between displays: turns were initiated closer to the centerline with larger bank angles on the augmented single display. There was no degradation in vertical and cross-track error and neither in response time with the augmented setup. It also did not result in any significant extra workload or simulator sick-ness. These findings demonstrate the potential value of upgrading flight training devices and remotely piloted vehicle ground stations to improve their utility and pave the way for future research into this domain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VR.2013.6549359","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Virtual Reality (VR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Virtual Reality (VR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542301/6549328/06549359.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"54","doi":"10.1109/VR.2013.6549359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating usability of amplified head rotations on base-to-final turn for flight simulation training devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating usability of amplified head rotations on base-to-final turn for flight simulation training devices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549359/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13736698","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating usability of amplified head rotations on base-to-final turn for flight simulation training devices","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"051ngoc.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042454S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542301","isNumber":"6549328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542301","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6549328","articleId":"6549359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6549501,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Li","affiliation":["Univ. of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Li","id":"37070559200"},{"name":"Charles Gibson","affiliation":["Univ. of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Gibson","id":"37070547000"},{"name":"David Ho","affiliation":["Univ. of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ho","id":"37070593600"},{"name":"Qi Zhou","affiliation":["Univ. of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37070552200"},{"name":"Jason Kim","affiliation":["Univ. of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kim","id":"37070635400"},{"name":"Omar Buhisi","affiliation":["Univ. of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Buhisi","id":"37070588300"},{"name":"Donald E.

While traditional computing frameworks have failed to provide adequate computing power for the now common data-intensive computing tasks, cloud computing provides an effective alternative to enhance computing power. Machine learning algorithms are powerful analytical methods that allow machines to recognize patterns and facilitate human learning. However, the performance of individual machine learning algorithms within each cloud computing framework remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the lack of a robust selection methodology matching input data with effective machine learning algorithms limits the ability of practitioners to make effective use of cloud computing. This research compares various machine learning algorithms on the widely adopted Apache Mahout framework and the recently introduced GraphLab framework. Whereas previous work has examined the computational architectures of various cloud computing frameworks, this work focuses on a problem-based approach to architecture selection. The experimental results demonstrate that GraphLab generally outperforms Mahout with respect to runtime, scalability, and usability. However, Mahout outperforms GraphLab when the experiment focus shifts to error measurement.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6531102/6549481/06549501.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of machine learning algorithms in cloud computing frameworks","doi":"10.1109/SIEDS.2013.6549501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIEDS.2013.6549501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-26 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of machine learning algorithms in cloud computing frameworks","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614870","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-26 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549501/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of machine learning algorithms in cloud computing frameworks","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"FridayPM1DataSim03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070314S","chronDate":"26-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6531102","isNumber":"6549481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531102","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6549481","articleId":"6549501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549509,"authors":[{"name":"Michelle S.

A critical component of integrating UAVs into the NAS is the timely identification and mitigation of cyber attacks that could overtake control of a UAV, without the UAV operator's knowledge of a security breach. In an effort to address this risk, this paper aims to achieve two objectives: (i) identify risks of cyber attacks on a UAV and (ii) create a methodology through which UAV operators are informed of such a security breach. The results of this study are intended to support the MITRE Corporation's efforts to identify and control risks associated with UAV integration into the NAS. To achieve the first objective the Capstone team utilized established risk assessment methodologies to identify risk scenarios and filter those scenarios into a manageable list. To achieve the second objective the team developed a methodology that measures the UAV velocity through two on-board systems and any significant difference in the two measures indicates a potential security breach. The team designed and performed an experiment using car movement to simulate UAV flight and performed statistical analysis on the results of the experiment. This contributed to a framework for determining a detection threshold for an alarm system to indicate a UAV may have been hijacked. The threshold accounts for a minimum difference between the two calculations of the velocity data and the duration of time in which this difference occurs, which can be calibrated to minimize Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors. The recommendation to the MITRE Corporation will contribute to the ongoing efforts to securely integrate UAVs into the NAS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-26 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549509/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549509/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13614878","conferenceDate":"26-26 April 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Risk analysis of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle hijacking and methods of its detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk analysis of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle hijacking and methods of its detection","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"FridayPM1SysIntgrtn02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094215S","chronDate":"26-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6531102","isNumber":"6549481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531102","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6549481","articleId":"6549509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6549542,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Mohiti","affiliation":["Power System Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Mohiti","id":"37070574800"},{"name":"Mahtab Khalilifar","affiliation":["Power System Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahtab","lastName":"Khalilifar","id":"37085751481"},{"name":"Ahmad Salehi","affiliation":["Power System Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Salehi","id":"37070552800"},{"name":"Rahim Zeinali","affiliation":["Power System Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Rahim","lastName":"Zeinali","id":"37070559900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3059-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3060-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3058-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549542","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549542","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power capacitors","Thyristors","Damping","Oscillators","Power system stability","Genetic algorithms","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","flexible AC transmission systems","genetic algorithms","oscillations","static VAr compensators","thyristor applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","TCSC tuning","optimal TCSC placement","oscillation damping","eigenvalue","systems oscillatory mode","DIgSILENT software","programming language","DPL","IEEE 9-bus system","FACTS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TCSC","oscillation damping","damping ratio","genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based Method for the allocation and tuning of TCSC to improve poorly damped oscillations.

The model aims to optimize storage devices and controllable loads operation minimizing the daily costs of imported energy from AC grid and satisfying operational constraints such as production process constraints. The optimization problem is formulated using the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) theory.

The active power filter (APF) is the best solution for eliminating the harmonics caused by the non-linear loads. This paper presents about a three-phase four-wire active power filter for power line conditioning to improve power quality in the distribution network and implementation of a digitally controlled APF. The active power filter is implemented with PWM based current controlled voltage source inverter (VSI).The switching signals for APF are generated through proposed three-level hysteresis current controller (HCC). The shunt APF system is modeled and investigated under different unbalanced non-linear load conditions using MATLAB program. The Controller Design using Hardware Description Language (VHDL or VERILOG) becomes independent of process technology. Synchronous reference frame (SRF) is used for generation of reference current. Both PI current algorithm and HCC are written in VHDL code and implemented using FPGA platform.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2013.6549618","publicationTitle":"2013 12th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542219/6549523/06549618.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2013.6549618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of different control strategy of conventional and digital controller for active power line conditioner (APLC) for harmonic compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of different control strategy of conventional and digital controller for active power line conditioner (APLC) for harmonic compensation","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549618/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13614598","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of different control strategy of conventional and digital controller for active power line conditioner (APLC) for harmonic compensation","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"paper74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118602S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542219","isNumber":"6549523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542219","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6549523","articleId":"6549618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6549724,"authors":[{"name":"Emil M.

The proposed method allows evaluating the blood pressure for each heart beat, without using a cuff or invasive tool. For each heart beat, a fixed number of features, which characterize the PPG pulse, are extracted and given as the input to the ANN. A systolic, diastolic and mean BP are obtained as the output. The improvement of the BP evaluation accuracy is obtained by removing artifacts from the references used to train the ANN. The filtering of the reference inputs is performed with Kalman based filter in order to take into account the variability of the human pulse rate and cardiovascular system. Preliminary experimental results confirm the suitability of the proposal and asses the BP evaluation accuracy within 5\u00b18 mmHg.","doi":"10.1109/MeMeA.2013.6549729","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530959/6549689/06549729.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"174","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MeMeA.2013.6549729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photoplethysmogram-based Blood pressure evaluation using Kalman filtering and Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Photoplethysmogram-based Blood pressure evaluation using Kalman filtering and Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13615161","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549729/","conferenceDate":"4-5 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photoplethysmogram-based Blood pressure evaluation using Kalman filtering and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Gatineau, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569707523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051908S","chronDate":"4-5 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530959","isNumber":"6549689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530959","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6549689","articleId":"6549729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":6549738,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Balouchestani","affiliation":["Electric and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Balouchestani","id":"37703670400"},{"name":"Kaamran Raahemifar","affiliation":["Electric and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Kaamran","lastName":"Raahemifar","id":"37273545200"},{"name":"Sridhar Krishnan","affiliation":["Electric and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Sridhar","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37275777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5197-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5195-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5196-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549738","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"abstract":"Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) consist of small intelligent biomedical wireless sensors attached on or implanted to the body to collect vital biomedical data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to provide continuous health monitoring systems for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. ECG signals are widely used in health care systems because they are noninvasive mechanisms to establish medical diagnosis of heart diseases. In order to fully exploit the benefits of WBANs to Electronic Health (EH), Mobile Health (MH), and Ambulatory Health Monitoring Systems (AHMS) the power consumption and sampling rate should be restricted to a minimum. With this in mind, Compressed Sensing (CS) procedure and the collaboration of Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) framework is used to provide new sampling approach for wireless ECG systems with CS theory. Advanced wireless ECG systems based on our approach will be able to deliver healthcare not only to patients in hospital and medical centers; but also in their homes and workplaces thus offering cost saving, and improving the quality of life. Our simulation results illustrate 25% reduction of Percentage Root-mean-square Difference (PRD) and a good level of quality for Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), sampling-rate, and power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6530959/6549689/06549738.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)","doi":"10.1109/MeMeA.2013.6549738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MeMeA.2013.6549738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New sampling approach for wireless ECG systems with compressed sensing theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Simulation","Signal to noise ratio","Sensors","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","compressed sensing","diseases","electrocardiography","health care","intelligent sensors","medical signal processing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling approach","wireless ECG system","compressed sensing theory","Wireless Body Area Networks","intelligent sensors","electrocardiogram","continuous health monitoring","heart disease","Electronic Health","Mobile Health","Ambulatory Health Monitoring Systems","Block Sparse Bayesian Learning","healthcare","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling-rate","Power Consumption","Wireless ECG Signal","Compressed Sensing","Block Sparse Bayesian learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"New sampling approach for wireless ECG systems with compressed sensing theory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13628974","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","conferenceDate":"4-5 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New sampling approach for wireless ECG systems with compressed sensing theory","confLoc":"Gatineau, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569706381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070854S","chronDate":"4-5 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6530959","isNumber":"6549689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6530959","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6549689","articleId":"6549738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6549776,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6136-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6135-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6134-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549776","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":644},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549776","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","multimedia systems","power aware computing","probability","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate computing","energy-efficient error-resilient multimedia systems","consumer devices","image processing","video processing","pattern recognition","facial recognition","data mining","data synthesis","user base","digital signal data processing","quality requirements","noise tolerant algorithms","statistical computations","probabilistic computations","human perception"]}],"abstract":"The rapid advancement in scaled silicon technology has resulted in the influx of numerous consumer devices with a plethora of applications.

We present an unconventional approach to Viterbi decoder design based on stochastic computing (SC) which represents data by random bit-streams that can be interpreted as probabilities. Stochastic circuits allow many decoding functions to be implemented by simple hardware; e.g., multi-bit multiplication can be realized by an AND gate. SC is also highly error-tolerant since a soft error (bit-flip) has little impact on a SC number's value. It also allows decoding precision to be traded for decoding speed. We design two SC-based Viterbi decoders and also a hybrid binary-SC design; the latter uses SC for arithmetic calculations, but not for storing numbers. The proposed designs are compared with a binary (non-SC) decoder using a standard (7, 1/2) convolutional code. The SC designs are found to be more tolerant of soft errors in the decoder than the binary design, and more capable of supporting some useful trade-offs among area cost, data rate, precision, and bit-error rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533795/6549768/06549790.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of stochastic Viterbi decoders for convolutional codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Viterbi algorithm","Clocks","Shift registers","Convolutional codes","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","logic design","logic gates","stochastic processes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic Viterbi decoder design","Viterbi algorithm","stochastic computing","random bit-streams","probabilities","stochastic circuits","decoding functions","multibit multiplication","AND gate","soft error","bit-flip","SC number value","decoding precision","decoding speed","SC-based Viterbi decoders","hybrid binary-SC design","binary decoder","standard convolutional code","soft errors","bit-error rate","data rate","area cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stochastic computing","Stochastic logic design","Viterbi decoders","Convolutional codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design of stochastic Viterbi decoders for convolutional codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549790/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614458","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of stochastic Viterbi decoders for convolutional codes","confLoc":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"066Session2A03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080873S","chronDate":"8-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533795","isNumber":"6549768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533795","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6549768","articleId":"6549790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549791,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Atef","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Atef","id":"37399575300"},{"name":"Hong Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Chen","id":"38251764900"},{"name":"Horst Zimmermann","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Horst","lastName":"Zimmermann","id":"37276432300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6136-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6135-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6134-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549791","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2067},"abstract":"This work presents the design and performance of a 10Gbit/s transimpedance amplifier (TIA) implemented in a 40nm CMOS technology.

The proposed operational amplifiers are designed to be applied in high speed system on chips (SoCs). The proposed operational amplifiers would find applications in continues time system (CTS) or discrete time system (DTS) according to their own frequency response type, which are discussed and verified by postlayout simulation. Under 1.1V supply voltage and 1k\u03a9+4pF load, simulation results show that 49dB DC gain, 3.2GHz GBW are achieved with 17mA DC current consumption for both operational amplifiers.

The intra prediction process for one macro block requires reconstructing the left and top neighbor macro blocks where the reconstruction path includes a number of processing units such as integer transform, quantization, inverse quantization and inverse integer transform. In order to meet the real time performance constraints of different video standards, a high throughput through this path is necessary. In this paper we propose architecture for real time implementation of the reconstruction path used in the H.264/AVC where the hardware is designed to be used as part of a complete H.264 video coding system. Each processing block executes in a single clock cycle for all calculations required for one 4\u00d74 block. In order to minimize area cost while maintaining the performance, dynamic partial reconfiguration is employed in the quantization and inverse quantization modules such that an area - efficient solution is found without impairing the throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An area efficient hardware architecture design for H.264/AVC intra prediction reconstruction path based on partial reconfiguration","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549794","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533795/6549768/06549794.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"An area efficient hardware architecture design for H.264/AVC intra prediction reconstruction path based on partial reconfiguration","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549794/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614462","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An area efficient hardware architecture design for H.264/AVC intra prediction reconstruction path based on partial reconfiguration","confLoc":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"086Session3A01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113384S","chronDate":"8-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533795","isNumber":"6549768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6549768","articleId":"6549794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6549795,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Kadl\u010dek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Kadl\u010dek","id":"37070583500"},{"name":"Otto Fu\u010d\u00edk","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Fu\u010d\u00edk","id":"38246522800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6136-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6135-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6134-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549795","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic synthesis of small AdaBoost classifier in FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549795","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Power demand","Optimization","Program processors","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AdaBoost classifier","FPGA","pre-processing units","power consumption reduction","image processing applications","automatic classifier synthesis","classification architecture","processing resources","optimization techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AdaBoost","FPGA","LBP","Automatic synthesis","FPGA optimisation"]}],"abstract":"Novel pre-processing units for AbaBoost classifiers are introduced which can improve performance and reduce power consumption in many image processing applications.

While existing LPM algorithms are able to achieve high throughput for IPv4 addresses, an IPv6 processing speed is limited. To achieve 100 Gbps throughput, LPM operation has to be processed in dedicated hardware and a forwarding table has to fit into an on-chip memory. Current LPM algorithms need large memory to store IPv6 forwarding tables or use compression with dynamic data structres, which can not be simply implemented in hardware. Therefore, we provide analysis of available forwarding tables of core routers and propose a new representation of prefix sets. The proposed representation has very low memory demands and is suitable for high-speed pipelined processing, which is shown on a new highly pipelined hardware architecture with 100 Gbps throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards hardware architecture for memory efficient IPv4/IPv6 Lookup in 100 Gbps networks","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549798","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533795/6549768/06549798.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards hardware architecture for memory efficient IPv4/IPv6 Lookup in 100 Gbps networks","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549798/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614466","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards hardware architecture for memory efficient IPv4/IPv6 Lookup in 100 Gbps networks","confLoc":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"108Session4A01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046363S","chronDate":"8-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533795","isNumber":"6549768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533795","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6549768","articleId":"6549798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549801,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Kastil","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Kastil","id":"37595347100"},{"name":"Vlastimil Kosar","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vlastimil","lastName":"Kosar","id":"38014764100"},{"name":"Jan Korenek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Korenek","id":"37595345800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6136-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6135-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6134-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549801","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Automata","Throughput","Hardware","Clocks","Computer architecture","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast pattern matching","computer networks","firewalls","intrusion detection systems","IDS","multigigabit speeds","attack detection","network flow level","advanced hardware architecture","fast regular expression matching","perfect hashing","multigigabit throughput","security systems"]}],"abstract":"As the speed of current computer networks increases, it is necessary to protect networks by security systems such as firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) operating at multigigabit speeds.

Pattern matching in the network flows is the time-critical operation of many modern IDS. Most of the regularly used patterns are described by the regular expression.

These agents which are distributed all over the network, collect, process, and distribute different fault information. Moreover, we propose an enhanced fault-tolerant and congestion-aware routing method that exploits the classified fault information related to the permanent faults that might occur inside the links, network interfaces and different parts of the routers.

The proposed flow is demonstrated on a simple example with multiplier and adder locations mutually exchanged.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relocation of reconfigurable modules on Xilinx FPGA","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549812","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533795/6549768/06549812.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Relocation of reconfigurable modules on Xilinx FPGA","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549812/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614480","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relocation of reconfigurable modules on Xilinx FPGA","confLoc":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"175Session6A01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075023S","chronDate":"8-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533795","isNumber":"6549768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533795","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6549768","articleId":"6549812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549817,"authors":[{"name":"Srijan Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Srijan","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37070533600"},{"name":"Sudip Roy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Roy","id":"37853240600"},{"name":"Partha P.

Existing mixing algorithms determine the mixing tree or mixing graph from a given target ratio of several biochemical fluids for on-chip mixture preparation. We present an algorithm to determine a reduced mixing tree by sharing the common subtrees within itself. We observe two transformations that preserve the semantics of the tree: (a) permutation of leaf nodes (input fluids/reagents) within the same level of a mixing tree, and (b) level-shifting of a leaf node to the next lower level by duplicating its appearance. The proposed algorithm utilizes both the intermediate droplets obtained after a split operation when a pair of identical subtrees are identified under permutation of leaf nodes at the same level. Simulation results for a large set of target ratios show that our algorithm reduces the mean values of the total number of mix-split steps, waste droplets and the number of mixer modules required for earliest completion by 16%, 29% and 12% over Min-Mix and by 22%, 34% and 20% over RMA, respectively. Moreover, it reduces the number of checkpoint insertions required for dynamic error recovery against incorrect mix-split steps during mixture preparation.","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549817","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533795/6549768/06549817.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient mixture preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549817/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient mixture preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614485","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549817/","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient mixture preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"205Session6B03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083902S","chronDate":"8-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533795","isNumber":"6549768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533795","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6549768","articleId":"6549817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549818,"authors":[{"name":"Jaroslav Sykora","affiliation":["Institute of Information Theory and Automation, ASCR, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Sykora","id":"38474875600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6136-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6135-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6134-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549818","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549818","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Vectors","Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Protocols","Registers","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handshake","clock-synchronous domain","fine-grained data-driven circuits","field programmable gate arrays","flow-transfer level","FIFO queues","flow synchronization","prototype compiler","synthesizable VHDL code","manual RTL VHDL design"]}],"abstract":"We present a technique for modelling and synthesis of fine-grained data-driven circuits in the clock-synchronous hardware, such as the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), called the Flow-Transfer Level (FTL). The distinguishing property of the FTL technique is that it does not rely on FIFO queues to handle flow synchronization between the components (called operators). The communication channels, called pipes, employ conceptually a two-state handshake protocol. The handshake behaviour of each operator is defined logically using dependency subgraphs that are symmetrical for producers and consumers. The original data-flow netlist of operators is transformed into a global control dependency graph. Cycles in dependency graphs are allowed as long as they do not constitute real data dependencies but only dependencies in promises of handshake completions. A method is given that recursively eliminates these cycles. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in a prototype compiler that transforms an FTL netlist into a synthesizable VHDL code. A comparison to a manual RTL VHDL design shows that our technique is very lightweight, yet it has a potential of increasing the design abstraction level.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549818","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533795/6549768/06549818.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"214","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composing data-driven circuits using handshake in the clock-synchronous domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Composing data-driven circuits using handshake in the clock-synchronous domain","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6549818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614486","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549818/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composing data-driven circuits using handshake in the clock-synchronous domain","confLoc":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"211Posters01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073503S","chronDate":"8-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533795","isNumber":"6549768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533795","xplore-issue":"6549768","articleId":"6549818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6549825,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Seiter","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Seiter","id":"38580632600"},{"name":"Michael Hofbauer","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hofbauer","id":"38232436200"},{"name":"Milos Davidovic","affiliation":["Avago Technologies Fiber Austria, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Davidovic","id":"37543118700"},{"name":"Horst Zimmermann","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Horst","lastName":"Zimmermann","id":"37276432300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6136-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6135-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6134-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"In this paper we present an FPGA based characterization system for our 3D TOF distance sensors supporting up to 128 \u00d7 128 pixels. The system is capable of flexibly generating all control signals required for a typical TOF measurement. Their properties can be changed within a very broad range. The cycle-to-cycle jitter of those signals was reduced to 1 ps by ECL circuitry. This is equivalent to a standard deviation of the measured distance of 0.15 mm. Furthermore, the system is able to preprocess the distance information before transferring the data to a terminal PC, which reduces the data load on the USB interface. The system includes an averaging function with a maximum of 256 elements to reduce the standard deviation of precision distance measurement sensors. A novel fiber based setup is introduced to systemize the characterization process. By means of averaging a standard deviation of 2 mm could be achieved with one of our 3D TOF distance sensors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6533795/6549768/06549825.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based time-of-flight 3D camera characterization system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Correlation","Field programmable gate arrays","Cameras","Optical fibers","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","distance measurement","field programmable gate arrays","jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","time-of-flight 3D camera","3D TOF distance sensors","cycle-to-cycle jitter","ECL circuitry","USB interface","distance measurement sensors","distance 0.15 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["characterization system","FPGA","optical distance sensor","TOF sensor","3D camera","time-of-flight"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based time-of-flight 3D camera characterization system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549825/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614493","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based time-of-flight 3D camera characterization system","confLoc":"Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"240Posters08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07196S","chronDate":"8-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6533795","isNumber":"6549768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6533795","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6549768","articleId":"6549825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6549831,"authors":[{"name":"Ond\u0159ej Hnili\u010dka","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechatronics, Informatics and Interdisciplinary Studies, Technical University of Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ond\u0159ej","lastName":"Hnili\u010dka","id":"37070611900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6136-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6135-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6134-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549831","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA architecture for fast floating point matrix inversion using uni-dimensional systolic array based structure","abstract":"This paper describes the structure of fast matrix inversion on FPGA.

These industries have been significant economic drivers in many parts of the United States supported by both government and private sectors. As a part of renewable energy industries, there is a strong growth in solar power generation industries that often requires prediction of solar energy to develop highly efficient stand-alone photovoltaic systems as well as hybrid power systems. Specifically solar radiation prediction is a important component in the solar energy production. However, some computational intelligence methods that have most successful applications on time series prediction have not yet been investigated on solar radiation prediction. Only a limited number of neural networks models were applied to the solar radiation monitoring. Therefore, we propose an Elman style based recurrent neural network to predict solar radiation from the past solar radiation and solar energy in this research. A hybrid learning algorithm incorporating particle swarm optimization and evolutional algorithm was presented, which takes the complementary advantages of the two global optimization algorithms. The neural networks model was trained by particle swarm optimization and evolutional algorithm to forecast the solar radiation. The excellent experimental results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid learning algorithm can be successfully used for the recurrent neural networks based prediction model for the solar radiation monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549894","startPage":"280","endPage":"286","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549844","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542295/6549844/06549894.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solar radiation prediction based on particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithm using recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549894/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solar radiation prediction based on particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithm using recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549894/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13614661","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","conferenceDate":"15-18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar radiation prediction based on particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithm using recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1569693609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060438S","chronDate":"15-18 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542295","isNumber":"6549844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542295","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6549844","articleId":"6549894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6549902,"authors":[{"name":"Jay Thor Turner","affiliation":["Autonomous Robotics Research Group (AR2G), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jay Thor","lastName":"Turner","id":"37070580400"},{"name":"Sidney N.

Robots need to know where they are relative to a global frame of reference, or other robots. Robot odometry is a trivial way of acquiring distance travelled by an autonomous vehicle. However, odometry has inherent flaws such as errors caused by wheel slippage on ground based vehicles. Other platforms like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have built-in odometry capabilities that can be affected by drift. Further, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has a 10 foot error, which contributes a significant error to the robots location as discussed in [10]. Landmark-based localization is an ideal supplement to odometry and GPS. Recognition of landmarks such as tags or terrain using cameras can provide localization data. The Parrot AR drone was the platform for the landmark-based localization experiments. The real-time camera feeds from the drone along with ROS' (Robot Operating System) AR tag node provided the parameters: roll, pitch, yaw, x-metric, y-metric, z-metric. Utilizing a mathematical algorithm and the camera feed, the relative position of the drone to a point of origin was calculated. The error associated with the position was an acceptable 100mm-150mm, which was a significant improvement compared to other localization methods. Landmark-based localization is proving to be an effective way to attain position information when other sources such as GPS are unavailable as described in [11]. Despite its advantages, certain limitations and challenges need addressing. Dealing with limitations in camera image quality, lighting and locale restrictions would require further exploration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6542295/6549844/06549921.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"451","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)","doi":"10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Landmark-based localization for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Mobile robots","Robot vision systems","Global Positioning System","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","distance measurement","Global Positioning System","position control","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["landmark-based localization","unmanned aerial vehicle","robotics","autonomous vehicle","robot odometry","wheel slippage","ground based vehicle","UAV","global positioning system","GPS","landmark recognition","Parrot AR drone","ROS","robot operating system","roll","pitch","yaw","x-metric","y-metric","z-metric","position information","camera image quality","lighting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["landmark-based localization","unmanned aerial vehicles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6549921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Landmark-based localization for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6549921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13614686","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2013","conferenceDate":"15-18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Landmark-based localization for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1569694097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067675S","chronDate":"15-18 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6542295","isNumber":"6549844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6542295","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6549844","articleId":"6549921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6549931,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00f4mulo Gon\u00e7alves Lins","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Design-Mechanical Engineering Faculty, University Estadual of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"R\u00f4mulo Gon\u00e7alves","lastName":"Lins","id":"37070530400"},{"name":"Paulo Roberto Gardel Kurka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Design-Mechanical Engineering Faculty, University Estadual of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Paulo Roberto Gardel","lastName":"Kurka","id":"38110816900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3108-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3107-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3106-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6549931","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Mathematical model","Solid modeling","Equations","Design automation","Image reconstruction","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobile industry","automotive components","computer vision","measurement systems","production engineering computing","quality control","shafts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicamera vision system","automated measurement","automotive component","multiview camera system","online dimensional measuring","crankshaft","measuring vision system","production line","dimensional quality control","digital camera","dimensional measurement","measurement system","virtual image simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vision system","systems architecture","manufacturing automation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the architecture of a multi-view cameras system with the purpose of online dimensional measuring of automotive components, specifically crankshafts.
