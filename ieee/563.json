During single talk, this method separates the echo from noise using the echo mixture as a reference signal to AEC, by which the performance of AEC is improved. During double talk, the near-end speech signal can be accurately separated from the mixture signals by BSS.

As the power amplifier is, in a transmission chain, the most power dispersive element, it seems judicious to investigate solutions allowing an optimization of its throughput. A possible solution aims at distorting the signal just before amplification thanks to a predistorter, updated with an adaptive algorithm. The association of the predistorter and the power amplifier should then appear as linear as possible. This paper proposes a comparative study of the algorithms performance in a DVB-T context. From these simulations considering memoryless and memory power amplifiers, the algorithms performance in the correction of nonlinear effects is shown and analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

In this paper, an efficient rate adaptive low density parity check (LDPC) coded modulation (RALCM) algorithm is proposed, which maximizes the payload rate for OFDM systems under the constraint of the given transmit power and the target bit error rate (BER). Taking advantage of the two dimensional look up table for the signal to noise ratio (SNR) thresholds, the RALCM algorithm assigns different combinations of the LDPC code rates and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulations for subcarriers according to the channel frequency response (CFR). Both theoretical analysis and computer simulation show that the proposed algorithm not only efficiently improves the payload rate of the LDPC coded OFDM system over frequency selective fading channels, but also inherently reduces the computational complexity of the system optimization.","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.899","startPage":"3684","endPage":"3688","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05630125.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Rate-Adaptive Modulation for LDPC-Coded OFDM System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5630125/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Rate-Adaptive Modulation for LDPC-Coded OFDM System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11647501","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5630125/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Rate-Adaptive Modulation for LDPC-Coded OFDM System","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031d684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08059S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5630125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5630215,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Yong Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Yong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37594803100"},{"name":"Zhang-Liang Shen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang-Liang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37591976000"},{"name":"Jun Mei","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Mei","id":"37605128000"},{"name":"Li-Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Li-Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089057139"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5630215","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":724},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inverters","Space vector pulse width modulation","Converters","Aerospace electronics","Indium phosphide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power factor","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neutral-point voltage balancing algorithm","neutral-point-clamped three-level inverter","virtual space vector PWM","index modulations","converter output voltage","load power factors","microprocessors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["three-level inverter","balance of neutral-point voltage","space vector pulse width modulation","60 degree coordinate system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630215","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05630215.pdf","startPage":"3283","endPage":"3287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Neutral-Point Voltage Balancing Algorithm for the NPC Three-Level Inverter Based on Virtual Space Vector PWM","abstract":"This paper explores the limitations of neutral-point voltage balancing problem for different loading conditions and index modulations of neutral-point-clamped three-level inverters.

One of the typical demanding vision tasks is 3D vision. This work describes design of a simple embedded stereo vision sensor - smart camera that can be used for spatial measurement. The system consists of a single core DSP processor and can work in several different setups because of its modular conception. The camera performs all computations itself and it is able to transmit the measurement results to a master unit using various interfaces including USB 2.0 High Speed and ethernet. Basic aspects influencing the overall accuracy of 3D position measurement are discussed in the contribution. This work is primarily focused on a simple task of object position evaluation in 3D. The problem is significantly simplified by utilizing an easily detectable object marker. Having realized the basic measurement we have shown that the overall position measurement precision nonlinearity is better than 0.5% from the full range (1000 mm). The aspects influencing the measurement accuracy and repeatability of measurement are also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An embedded stereovision system: Aspects of measurement precision","publicationTitle":"2010 12th Biennial Baltic Electronics Conference","doi":"10.1109/BEC.2010.5630305","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th Biennial Baltic Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621665/5629721/05630305.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BEC.2010.5630305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5630305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An embedded stereovision system: Aspects of measurement precision","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5630305/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649442","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An embedded stereovision system: Aspects of measurement precision","confLoc":"Tallinn, Estonia","sourcePdf":"35150F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060849S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621665","isNumber":"5629721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621665","xplore-issue":"5629721","articleId":"5630305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5630415,"authors":[{"name":"Fangni Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fangni","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536948500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7874-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7871-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7873-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5630415","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Geometry","OFDM","Convolution","Decoding","Encoding","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MB-OFDM UWB system","LDPC code","low-density parity-check coding","Euclidean geometry","high speed wireless communications","UWB communication","channel coding","adverse channel propagation"]}],"abstract":"MB-OFDM UWB technology has attracted much attention in high speed wireless communications.

Through analysis of electrics and mechanics of the RF switch, a novel NEMS switch with nano-scaling is presented in this paper. The measured data show the pull-in voltage of 24.1V and the good RF performance of the insertion loss of beyond -20dB @0-40GHz on the \"on\" state, the isolation of below -25dB at 0-40GHz on the \"off\" state, indicating that the witch is suitable for the 0-20GHz applications. The Haar-Wavelet-Based multiresolution time domain (MRTD) with compactly supported scaling function presented is used for modeling and analyzing the nanomachine switch for the first time. The algorithm of the method is real-time time and space adaptive grids through the efficient thresholding of the wavelet coefficients. Analysis shows that the NEMS switch not only can work in wide frequency bands, but also has better isolation performance in lower frequency, and thus extending the application to the lower band. Though there has errors about 3% between the measured and computed results, we analyze the main causes and do our best to find the solution for next work.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Nanoelectromechanical systems","Electrodes","Microwave measurements","Time domain analysis","Loss measurement","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave switches","nanoelectromechanical devices","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NEMS switch","RF-NEMS switch","nanoscaling","pull-in voltage","insertion loss","off state","Haar-Wavelet-based multiresolution time domain","nanomachine switch","space adaptive grids","real-time time","wavelet coefficients","voltage 24.1 V","frequency 0 GHz to 40 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nano-electro-mechanical system","multiresolution time-domain","nanomachine switch","Casimir effects","nano-scaling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.814","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05630432.pdf","startPage":"3339","endPage":"3342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of NEMS Switch Using Changeable Space Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of NEMS Switch Using Changeable Space Domain","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5630432/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5630432/","accessionNumber":"11647896","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of NEMS Switch Using Changeable Space Domain","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031d339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076057S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5630432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5630440,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Li","firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Hongyi Chen","firstName":"Hongyi","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Xiaoying Zhang","firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7874-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7871-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7873-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5630440","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Interpolation","Delay","Robustness","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interpolation","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-aided OFDM systems","channel estimation","symbol timing offset","MMSE interpolation","minimum mean-square-error","linear phase rotation","wireless channel statistics","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In pilot-aided OFDM systems, the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) interpolator provides the optimum performance based on the channel statistics.

However, the attitude of unmanned aerial vehicles cannot be determined accurately, which will lead to the decrease of accuracy and efficiency of automatic matching, so image preprocessing should be done to guarantee enough degree of overlap for image mosaicking and mapping. There are some ascendant characteristics of SIFT operator such as invariant to scale, rotation, and lightness, and these characteristics are very useful in increasing the matching accuracy of UAV images. In this paper, the overlap analysis of UAV images has been processed based on the SIFT algorithm, and the steps of overlap analysis are described, and the way of treating wrong matching points is explained. Finally, satisfactory results are obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05630515.pdf","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1462","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlap Analysis of the Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Feature extraction","Algorithm design and analysis","Remote sensing","Image resolution","Meteorology","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","image matching","image segmentation","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image overlap analysis","unmanned aerial vehicles","automatic matching","image preprocessing","image mosaicking","image mapping","SIFT algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV images","SIFT","degree of overlap","image","overlap analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5630515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Overlap Analysis of the Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5630515/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11648046","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlap Analysis of the Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031b459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048014S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5630515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5630542,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyan Dong","affiliation":["The College of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Dong","id":"37601080400"},{"name":"Hongmin Guo","affiliation":["China Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Hongmin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37595197400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5630542","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","Control engineering","Data models","Presses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed A/D sampling control circuit design","sample control process","sampling sequence","MAX+PLUSII software","VHDL language tool","high-speed FPGA","high-speed data collecting system","expectant function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","MAX+PLUSII","VHDL","TLC5510","FIFO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630542","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05630542.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of the High-Speed A/D Sampling Control Circuit Basing on FPGA","abstract":"This design describe a sample control process according to sampling sequence with MAX+PLUSII software and the VHDL language tool.

Practicability and advantages of the proposed technique are demonstrated on numerous examples, such as data sorting, priority buffering and embedded controllers.","doi":"10.1109/BEC.2010.5630751","publicationTitle":"2010 12th Biennial Baltic Electronics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th Biennial Baltic Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621665/5629721/05630751.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BEC.2010.5630751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629721","startPage":"37","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of circuits and systems from hierarchical and parallel specifications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of circuits and systems from hierarchical and parallel specifications","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5630751/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649420","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of circuits and systems from hierarchical and parallel specifications","confLoc":"Tallinn, Estonia","sourcePdf":"06251F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034156S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","isNumber":"5629721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621665","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5630751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5630771,"authors":[{"name":"Xiulan Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiulan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601018200"},{"name":"Zhengzhi Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhengzhi","lastName":"Han","id":"37335597900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5630771","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Artificial neural networks","Prediction algorithms","Terrain factors","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","disasters","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","public administration","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural network","disaster spatial monitor subsystem","offline learning algorithm","disaster time forecast subsystem","online learning algorithm","landslide forecast","forecast precision","orthogonal least square algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBF neural network","disaster forecast","online learning","time series"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630771","abstract":"A new disaster monitor and forecast system based on RBF neural networks is proposed. This disaster forecast system consists of disaster spatial monitor subsystem that is pre-trained by off-line learning algorithms and disaster time forecast subsystem developed by online learning algorithms. The disaster spatial monitor subsystem aims to detect trend of the objective behavior, once the unstable condition is detected, the real time series will be collected and used to forecast disaster by the disaster time forecast subsystem. Using real time data on the eve of disaster, which contain more information about the disaster, this system can largely improve the pertinence and guarantee the accuracy of disaster forecast. To illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness, this system is applied to the landslide forecast. Simulation results show that the spatial monitor subsystem can effectively forecast the stability of the various monitoring points and the time forecast subsystem established by online learning algorithms has better forecast precision as compared with the subsystem established by the Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm. The results also illustrate that the system holds high precise if real time date are sufficient and has a broad application prospects.","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.41","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05630771.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Disaster Monitor and Forecast System Based on RBF Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5630771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A New Disaster Monitor and Forecast System Based on RBF Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11647549","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5630771/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Disaster Monitor and Forecast System Based on RBF Neural Networks","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031a132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081602S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5630771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5630772,"authors":[{"name":"Dehong Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Vessel integrated power system, Technology Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Dehong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37595515500"},{"name":"An Hu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Vessel integrated power system, Technology Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Hu","id":"37593185200"},{"name":"Guangsen Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Vessel integrated power system, Technology Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guangsen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37597487700"},{"name":"Wenhua Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Huazhong, University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Hu","id":"37574774900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5630772","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":558},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","Voltage control","Switches","Field programmable gate arrays","Pulse width modulation","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","electric current control","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current sharing schemes","multiphase interleaved DC-DC converter","FPGA implementation","EMI noise","current measurement","current control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiphase interleaved","bidirectional dc/dc converter","current sharing","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Many multiphase interleaved DC/DC converter requires current sharing with average current control.

Because of GPS receivers error sources are time variant, it is necessary to remove the GPS measurement noise. In this paper a Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) has been applied to GPS receivers timing data for modeling of their timing error sources. This method estimates GPS receivers timing errors from their previous values. The efficiency of this algorithm is illustrated by experiments. For real-time restitution of GPS timing accuracy, the proposed method is implemented on designed hardwares. The experimental tests results on collected real data emphasizes that GPS timing RMS errors can be reduced from 300 nsec and 200 nsec to less than 160 nsec and 41 nsec, with and without SA, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.1483","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05630774.pdf","startPage":"2572","endPage":"2575","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.1483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of Accurate GPS Timing Based on Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network in Electric Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5630774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Use of Accurate GPS Timing Based on Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network in Electric Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11647552","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5630774/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Accurate GPS Timing Based on Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network in Electric Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031c572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058456S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5630774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5630778,"authors":[{"name":"Zhurong Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi''an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhurong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279252200"},{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi''an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598335500"},{"name":"Duwu Cui","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi''an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Duwu","lastName":"Cui","id":"37285043300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5630778","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetics","Optimization","Evolutionary computation","Knowledge engineering","Gallium","Biological cells","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","evolution (biological)","genetic algorithms","genetics","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","migrating operator","cultivating operator","gene segment","chromosome","higher probability","illumination information","blindness","genetic operation","migrating condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Cultivating operator","Migrating schema"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5630778","abstract":"A new genetic algorithm, combined cultivating with migrating operators (CMGA), is proposed.

ICA based technique is based on independence of source signals and these conditions are satisfied in multi-user CDMA environment. The aim is to recover a set of unknown mutually independent source signals from their observed mixtures without knowledge of the mixing coefficients. Combining an ICA element to conventional signal detection reduces MAI (multiple access interference) and enables a robust, computationally efficient structure. For traditional ICA algorithm ignore noise, in this paper Improved-ICA algorithm considering the noise is proposed for multi-user DS-CDMA signal and compared with JADE and Fast-ICA algorithms. In this paper bit error rate simulations of these algorithms has been given for different number of users, SNR and compared. The results show that the proposed Improved-ICA is more effective compared with traditional algorithms and performs better at separating the source signals from the mixed CDMA signals with noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628463/5629505/05631036.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5631036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User Detection of DS-CDMA Based on Improved-ICA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal processing algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit error rate","Multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","error statistics","independent component analysis","interference suppression","multiuser detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","direct sequence code division multiple access","DS-CDMA","joint approximation diagonalization of eigenmatrices","improved independent component analysis","multiple access interference","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5631036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User Detection of DS-CDMA Based on Improved-ICA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5631036/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11642280","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User Detection of DS-CDMA Based on Improved-ICA","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"04-025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034488S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628463","isNumber":"5629505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628463","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5629505","articleId":"5631036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5631068,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599930900"},{"name":"Guisheng Liao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guisheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37265079200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7874-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7871-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7873-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5631068","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"abstract":"An algorithm for joint direction-of-departures (DODs) and direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) estimation using real polynomial rooting in bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is presented.

A kind of high precision SINS/GPS integrated system for airborne SAR motion compensation is presented. This system, integrated the long-term stability of GPS (global positioning system) and the short-term high precision and data rate of SINS (strapdown inertial navigation system), acquires both long and short-term accuracy, in which Kalman Filter is used to damp the SINS error increasing over time by the positioning information of GPS. Simulation shows that the method can meet the requirements of 0.5meter resolution X-band SAR. Furthermore, the schema has the advantages of free of master inertial navigation system (MINS), easy implementation and feasible real-time motion compensation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Compensation Research Based on Motion Sensors","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631231","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628463/5629505/05631231.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5631231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5631231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Motion Compensation Research Based on Motion Sensors","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5631231/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11642209","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Compensation Research Based on Motion Sensors","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"01-097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037222S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628463","isNumber":"5629505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628463","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629505","articleId":"5631231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5631237,"authors":[{"name":"Jing He","firstName":"Jing","lastName":"He","id":"37597247900"},{"name":"Lanjuan Ma","firstName":"Lanjuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37597178400"},{"name":"Xinyu Xu","firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37595305100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7874-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7871-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7873-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5631237","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Memory management","Signal to noise ratio","Delay","Discrete Fourier transforms","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["length-variable FFT processor","mixed radix algorithm","SDF architecture","selfdefined floating point approach","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, design of a length variable FFT processor is presented.

The received echo is decomposed into the sum of many basis sub-signals that are generated by discretizing the target spatial domain and velocity domain and synthesizing the SAR received data for every discretized spatial position and velocity candidate. In this way, the SAR imaging problem is converted into sub-signal selection problem. Thus, in the case that moving targets are sparsely distributed in the observed scene, their positions and velocities can be reconstructed by using the CS technique. It is shown that, compared with traditional algorithms, the target image produced by the proposed algorithm has higher resolution and lower side-lobe. Moreover, multiple targets with different speeds can be imaged simultaneously, so the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR Imaging of Moving Targets via Compressive Sensing","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","doi":"10.1109/iCECE.2010.456","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628462/5629497/05631301.pdf","startPage":"1855","endPage":"1858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCECE.2010.456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5631301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5631301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"SAR Imaging of Moving Targets via Compressive Sensing","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5631301/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11642760","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Imaging of Moving Targets via Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4031b855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064566S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628462","isNumber":"5629497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628462","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5629497","articleId":"5631301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5631340,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Feng","affiliation":["VLSI Institute, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Feng","id":"37590210900"},{"name":"Zeqi Yu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zeqi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37595132200"},{"name":"Zhigang Han","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Han","id":"37085527123"},{"name":"Fan Feng","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Feng","id":"38666263700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7874-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7871-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7873-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5631340","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":952},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power supplies","Pulse width modulation","Generators","Noise","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","digital filters","error correction","power amplifiers","pulse width modulation","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital audio class D power amplifier","error correction method","system level design","high-performance low-complexity interpolation filter","8th-order sigma-delta modulator","digital double-edge PWM generator","H-bridge power stage","power supply noise","simulation","word length 5 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5631340","doi":"10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629505","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628463/5629505/05631340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Level Design of a Digital Audio Class D Power Amplifier","abstract":"Based on an error correction method for digital audio class D power amplifiers, a digital audio class D power amplifier is designed at system level in this paper.

Anomaly detection is essentially a problem of one-class classification, a good solution of which is SVDD, using optimized minimal hypersphere to express tightly the background and using distinguish function to detect anomalous pixels. The method avoided the problem that general detect method based on statistical theory make large numbers of false alarms due to the assumptions that background is Gaussian and homogeneous. High dimension character of hyperspectral imagery increased the operation amount, while proposed ISVDD reduced the operation amount multiply and reduced the interference of background to decrease numbers of false alarms. The experiment on the simulation data shows the validity and practicability of the method and the performance of anomaly detection exceeded obviously SVDD method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628463/5629505/05631355.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5631355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery Based on Incremental Support Vector Data Description","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Support vector machines","Pixel","Hyperspectral imaging","Adaptation model","Training data","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer software","Gaussian processes","geophysical image processing","image classification","image resolution","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","hyperspectral imagery","incremental support vector data description","one-class classification","optimized minimal hypersphere","anomalous pixels","statistical theory","false alarms","Gaussian background","interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5631355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery Based on Incremental Support Vector Data Description","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5631355/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11647120","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery Based on Incremental Support Vector Data Description","confLoc":"Ningbo, China","sourcePdf":"02-101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040925S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628463","isNumber":"5629505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628463","xplore-issue":"5629505","articleId":"5631355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5631456,"authors":[{"name":"Lincong Luo","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, College of Information Engineer, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lincong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086891224"},{"name":"Hao Feng","affiliation":["Jiaxing University Mechanical &, Electrical Engineering College, Jiaxing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Feng","id":"37552750200"},{"name":"Lijun Ding","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, College of Information Engineer, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Ding","id":"37647968100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7874-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7871-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7873-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5631456","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5631456","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quaternions","Artificial neural networks","Image coding","Color","Image reconstruction","Principal component analysis","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","Hebbian learning","image coding","image colour analysis","image reconstruction","matrix algebra","neural nets","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color image compression algorithm","quaternion neural network principal component analysis","Lena RGB based color image","quaternion matrix","vector quantization","generalized Hebbian algorithm","quaternion weight coefficient","image reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631456","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628463/5629505/05631456.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5631456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Image Compression Based on Quaternion Neural Network Principal Component Analysis","abstract":"A color image compression algorithm based on quaternion neural network approach is proposed.

The common mode input range of a MOS differential stage is limited by the threshold voltage of the input transistors. With a pair of complementary input stages the whole range from GND to VDD can be covered. Their drain currents are summed up but the resulting current as well as the DC voltage of the summing node drastically change when one of the input stages turns off near the power rails. The new method applies a built-in feedback loop with an auxiliary opamp for stabilizing the voltage at the summing node. This way a very stable operating point and ideal CMRR can be assured. With selected transistor aspect ratios nearly constant voltage gain can be achieved for the whole common mode input voltage range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5631558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5631558/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649392","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rail-to-rail CMOS opamp with stabilized operating point","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rail-to-rail CMOS opamp with stabilized operating point","confLoc":"Tallinn, Estonia","sourcePdf":"20142F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045724S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621665","isNumber":"5629721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621665","xplore-issue":"5629721","articleId":"5631558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5631576,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, little attention is given to the process of designing a domain architecture that is well suited to MDE techniques such as domain-specific languages and software transformations. A domain-specific software architecture is normally developed based on a few selected and important requirements, called architectural drivers. This paper presents three types of architectural drivers that can be used to build a software architecture that can take full advantage of the benefits of MDE. It also presents some patterns that can be used to help in the architectural design. An evaluation is also presented, showing that, when used together in a model-driven domain engineering project, these drivers and patterns can lead to some benefits in terms of reusability and complexity, but that in some cases there are drawbacks that need to be considered in a trade-off analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5631928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5631928/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11648732","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Designing Domain Architectures for Model-Driven Engineering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Domain Architectures for Model-Driven Engineering","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4259a100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073464S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628340","isNumber":"5629582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628340","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629582","articleId":"5631928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5631931,"authors":[{"name":"Shao Xiao-fang","affiliation":["College of Aeronautical Electronics,Qingdao Branch, Naval Aeronautical Engineering Institute, QingDao, China"],"firstName":"Shao","lastName":"Xiao-fang","id":"38273431500"},{"name":"Liu Chao-jun","affiliation":["College of Aeronautical Electronics,Qingdao Branch, Naval Aeronautical Engineering Institute, QingDao, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Chao-jun","id":"38272188800"},{"name":"Cai Ming-juan","affiliation":["Standardization Institute, Naval Equipment Academa, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Cai","lastName":"Ming-juan","id":"38271342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6881-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4031-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5631931","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5631931","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Fractals","Solid modeling","Meteorological radar","Computational modeling","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractals","interpolation","meteorological radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar meteorologic nephogram simulation","fractal interpolation theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractal interpolation","Cloud","Meteorologic nephogram"]}],"abstract":"This paper puts forward an algorithm for simulating radar meteorologic nephogram which applys fractal interpolation theory to construct the contour of the radar meteorologic nephogram.

It shows that the bigger ratio of fluorocarbon corresponding to the bigger chamber pressure and relative bigger mass flow as to the same structural factor. And the nozzle throat diameter has a large impact on the pressure and gas mass flow rate. Besides, we also compared the gas pressure and gas mass flow rate of mixture gas with that of SF6 gas.

Application of the momentum technique dealing with the local optima has proved efficient but it is vulnerable to over fitting. In contrast, deployment of the early stopping technique might overcome the over fitting phenomena but it sometimes terminates into the local minima. This paper proposes a hybrid approach, which is a combination of two processing neurons: momentum and early stopping, to tackle these hazards, aiming at improving the performance of neural networks in terms of both accuracy and processing time in function approximation. Experimental results conducted on various kinds of non-linear functions have demonstrated that the proposed approach is dominant compared with conventional learning approaches.","doi":"10.1109/KSE.2010.15","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628458/5632003/05632142.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"109","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KSE.2010.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5632003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smoothing Supervised Learning of Neural Networks for Function Approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Smoothing Supervised Learning of Neural Networks for Function Approximation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11648282","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5632142/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smoothing Supervised Learning of Neural Networks for Function Approximation","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"4213a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061665S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628458","isNumber":"5632003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5632003","articleId":"5632142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5632143,"authors":[{"name":"Adina Mosincat","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Adina","lastName":"Mosincat","id":"37396545400"},{"name":"Walter Binder","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Binder","id":"37316123900"},{"name":"Mehdi Jazayeri","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Jazayeri","id":"37265111200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7966-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7719"}],"articleNumber":"5632143","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Adaptation model","Runtime","Monitoring","Weather forecasting","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software quality","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["runtime adaptability","automated model evolution","dynamically adaptive system","quality parameter","BPEL based framework","service composition model","quality of service","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic adaptability","model evolution","model at runtime","quality requirements"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632143","abstract":"Dynamically adaptive systems propose adaptation by means of variants that are specified in the system model at design time and allow for a fixed set of different runtime configurations. However, in a dynamic environment, unanticipated changes may result in the inability of the system to meet its quality requirements. To allow the system to react to these changes we propose a solution for automatically evolving the system model by integrating new variants and periodically validating existing ones based on updated quality parameters. To illustrate our approach we present a BPEL based framework using a service composition model to represent the system functional requirements. Our framework estimates Quality of Service (QoS) values based on information provided by our monitoring mechanism, ensuring that changes in QoS are reflected in the system model. We show how the evolved model can be used at runtime to increase the system's autonomic capabilities and delivered QoS.","doi":"10.1109/EDOC.2010.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDOC.2010.22","startPage":"217","endPage":"226","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 14th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628338/5629535/05632143.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 14th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime Adaptability through Automated Model Evolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Runtime Adaptability through Automated Model Evolution","conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5632143/","accessionNumber":"11648771","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632143/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Adaptability through Automated Model Evolution","confLoc":"Vitoria, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4163a217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08131S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628338","isNumber":"5629535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628338","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5629535","articleId":"5632143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5632144,"authors":[{"name":"Arjon Turnip","affiliation":["Department of Cogno Mechatronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5628458/5632003/5632144/5632144-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stergios Stotas (S'07) was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1985.

This characteristic comes from the nature of battlefields where such factors as enemies and terrains are not easy to be determined. Hence disruption of missions is likely to occur whenever happening a change. This requires generating plans that can adapt quickly to changes during execution of missions, while paying a less cost. In this paper, we propose a computational approach for adaptation of mission plans dealing with any possible disruption caused by changes. It first mathematically models the dynamic planning problem with two criteria: the mission execution time and the cost of operations. Based on this quantification, we introduce a computational framework, which has an evolutionary mechanism for adapting the current solution to new situations resulted from changes. We carried out a case study on this newly proposed approach. A modified military scenario of a mission was used for testing. The obtained results strongly support our proposal in finding adaptive solution dealing with the changes.","doi":"10.1109/KSE.2010.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KSE.2010.37","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628458/5632003/05632148.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5632003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Computational Framework for Adaptation in Military Mission Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Computational Framework for Adaptation in Military Mission Planning","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11648286","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5632148/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computational Framework for Adaptation in Military Mission Planning","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"4213a077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074825S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628458","isNumber":"5632003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628458","xplore-issue":"5632003","articleId":"5632148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5632175,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Demori","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi Di Brescia, Brescia, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Demori","id":"37590788000"},{"name":"Vittorio Ferrari","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi Di Brescia, Brescia, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37274804400"},{"name":"Pietro Poesio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica e Industriale, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi Di Brescia, Brescia, Italy"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Poesio","id":"37590788900"},{"name":"Domenico Strazza","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica e Industriale, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi Di Brescia, Brescia, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Strazza","id":"37590789200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7473-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7474-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5632175","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluids","Microchannel","Capacitance","Permittivity","Dielectric measurements","Microfluidics","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance measurement","capacitive sensors","flow measurement","flow sensors","intelligent sensors","microchannel flow","microelectrodes","microfabrication","permittivity","photolithography","polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic device","embedded capacitive sensor","fluid discrimination","fluid characterization","dielectric permittivity","polydimethylsiloxane","soft photolithography","screen printing","microchannel","PDMS layer","electrode","tailored electronic interface system","capacitance measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microfluidic devices","capacitive sensing","fluid discrimination","PDMS","screen-printing technology"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the development of a microfluidic device with embedded capacitive sensing that allows the discrimination of fluids on the basis of the dielectric permittivity.

A similar idea can be applied straightforwardly to single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronautics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronautics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618727/5632200/05632202.pdf","startPage":"1174","endPage":"1177","doi":"10.1109/ISSCAA.2010.5632202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCAA.2010.5632202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5632200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of signal subspace information in blind FIR channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the use of signal subspace information in blind FIR channel estimation","htmlLink":"/document/5632202/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11649866","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of signal subspace information in blind FIR channel estimation","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"WeL305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077281S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618727","isNumber":"5632200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618727","xplore-issue":"5632200","articleId":"5632202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5632216,"authors":[{"name":"Han Han","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Han","id":"38183210100"},{"name":"Jin-long Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jin-long","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280540300"},{"name":"Qi-hui Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qi-hui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290356800"},{"name":"Yu-zhen Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yu-zhen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37597449200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5632216","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Decision making","Throughput","Wideband","Computational complexity","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision making","dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal wideband spectrum sensing","decision making","cognitive radio","cognitive transmission","brute force search","dynamic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","wideband","sensing order","decision-making tree"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal wideband spectrum sensing order based on decision-making tree in cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5632216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05632216.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5632216","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632216","abstract":"In the cognitive radio networks, the cognitive user must scan the multi-channel to acquire an idle channel before its cognitive transmission. If the sensing capability is limited, the user must sense the multi-channel one by one. So the sensing order is very crucial to the realization of maximum throughput. In this paper, we aim to find the optimal wideband sensing order in polynomial time which is much faster than brute-force search and dynamic programming approach. First, we present two greed solutions, with the trait: fast but not optimal. Also, we analyze and improve the potential function in the optimality principle of sequencing. Then, we propose the decision-making tree method with the proper branching rule and the lopping rule, to search the optimal wideband spectrum sensing order. In the end, through the performance analysis, we validate the low computational complexity and the optimality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11652286","htmlLink":"/document/5632216/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal wideband spectrum sensing order based on decision-making tree in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal wideband spectrum sensing order based on decision-making tree in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569332272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069846S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5632216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5632256,"authors":[{"name":"Zhicheng Li","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhicheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086799282"},{"name":"Sen Wang","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599734800"},{"name":"Zhongyang Fei","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, AeroSpace & Structural Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongyang","lastName":"Fei","id":"37588660900"},{"name":"Huijun Gao","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Huijun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277495500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6045-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6043-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6044-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7505-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5632256","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Time varying systems","Attenuation","Delay effects","Stability criteria","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","delay systems","H\u221e control","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","Markov processes","stability","state feedback","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H\u221e control","Markovian jump system","mode-dependent time-varying delay","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","LKF","stochastic stability","linear matrix inequality","LMI","state feedback controller","closed-loop system","disturbance attenuation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Markovian jump systems","Stochastic stability","Delay partitioning","H\u221e control","Time-varying delays","Mode-dependent delays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632256","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n control for a class of Markov jump systems with mode-dependent time-varying delays.

How to report the local sensing results to the fusion center has not aroused much interest. Since OFDM has been widely recognized as a promising candidate for cognitive radio in opportunistic spectrum access scenarios, a OFDMA-based sensing reporting scheme is designed. Correspondingly, several fusion rules at fusion center side are proposed according to the knowledge of the reporting channel and local sensing performance indices. It is shown by simulations that the fusion with the perfect reporting channel state information is optimum. If the fusion center has no knowledge of the reporting channel, soft fusion outperforms hard decision combination. Fusion with the statistic knowledge of the reporting channel is valid for practical use.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05632310.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5632310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5632310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Report the sensing results using OFDMA in cooperative spectrum sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","OFDM","Probability","Signal to noise ratio","Channel state information","Receivers","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA","cooperative spectrum sensing","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","cognitive radio network","network detection reliability","opportunistic spectrum access","channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Report the sensing results using OFDMA in cooperative spectrum sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5632310/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652287","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Report the sensing results using OFDMA in cooperative spectrum sensing","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569333399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056239S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5632310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5632344,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Lubkoll","affiliation":["Erlangen Friedrich Alexander University, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Lubkoll","id":"37543076700"},{"name":"Otto Strobel","affiliation":["Esslingen University of Applied Sciences, Germany"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Strobel","id":"37543028100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7184-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-966-335-334-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5632344","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Optical attenuators","Optical fiber networks","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diodes","lasers","light emitting diodes","optical fibre communication","optical fibres","polymer fibres","system buses","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short range optical communication systems","vehicles","airplanes","fiber-optic data buses","automotive applications","media oriented system transport","LED","polymer optical fibers","transmitter","vertical surface emitting laser","plastic fiber","polymer-cladded silica fiber","silicon photo diodes","bit rate 150 Mbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals mainly with state of the art and next-decade technologies for fiber-optic data buses in automotive applications.

Consequently, the use of LEDs and polymer optical fibers (POF) is sufficient. For higher data rates, also alternative solutions are discussed: The LED as transmitter can be replaced by a vertical surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and the plastic fiber (POF) by polymer-cladded silica (PCS) fiber. Due to the inherent fact that, as a result, the fiber diameter is reduced, the detector area of the well-known Silicon photo diodes can also be reduced greatly.

The most important devices for fiberoptic transmission systems are presented, and their properties discussed. In particular we consider such systems working with those basic components which are necessary to explain the principle of operation. Among them is the optical transmitter, consisting of a light source, typically a high speed driven laser diode. Furthermore, the optical receiver has to be mentioned; it consists of a photodiode and a low noise high bit rate front-end amplifier. Yet, in the focus of the considerations you will find the optical fiber as the dominant element in optical communication systems. Different fiber types are presented, and their properties explained. The joint action of these three basic components leads to fiberoptic systems, mainly applied for data communication. The systems operate as transmission links with bit rates up to 40 Gbit/s and more. Furthermore optical communication systems are also used for recent application areas in the MBit/s region, e.g. in aviation, automobile and maritime industry.","doi":"10.1109/CRMICO.2010.5632426","publicationTitle":"2010 20th International Crimean Conference \"Microwave & Telecommunication Technology\"","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 20th International Crimean Conference \"Microwave & Telecommunication Technology\"","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610957/5629798/05632426.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRMICO.2010.5632426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629798","startPage":"16","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber-optic communication \u2014 An overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fiber-optic communication \u2014 An overview","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632426/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11651384","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5632426/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber-optic communication \u2014 An overview","confLoc":"Sevastopol, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"016020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07932S","chronDate":"13-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610957","isNumber":"5629798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610957","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5629798","articleId":"5632426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5632504,"authors":[{"name":"Lisheng Fan","affiliation":["Youth Foundation, Shantou University, China"],"lastName":"Lisheng Fan","id":"37087578272"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Youth Foundation, Shantou University, China"],"lastName":"Jing Li","id":"37087257526"},{"name":"Yuanmo Lin","affiliation":["Youth Foundation, Shantou University, China"],"lastName":"Yuanmo Lin","id":"37088133441"},{"name":"Xianfu Lei","affiliation":["Youth Foundation, Shantou University, China"],"lastName":"Xianfu Lei","id":"37087209855"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Youth Foundation, Shantou University, China"],"lastName":"Feifei Gao","id":"37087199581"},{"name":"Yongquan Jiang","affiliation":["Youth Foundation, Shantou University, China"],"lastName":"Yongquan Jiang","id":"37087869612"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6045-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6043-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6044-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7505-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5632504","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Bit error rate","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency modulation","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","frequency hop communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-hopping scheme","OFDM","multiuser system","group frequency-hopping","resource reuse efficiency","multipath fading","bit-error-rate","BER","deep fading subcarriers"]}],"abstract":"This paper devises a novel group frequency-hopping (FH) scheme for OFDM modulated multiuser system, in order to optimize the resource reuse efficiency and resolve the performance degradation due to the deep fading in the same time. In the OFDM modulated multiuser system, the traditional FH schemes can work in a multipath fading environment and achieve a moderate bit-error-rate (BER). However, when the deep fading subcarriers exist, the traditional schemes present poor performance, because the deep fading subcarriers become dominant factor in determining the overall BER performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel group FH scheme. The scheme reorganizes the frequency domain sequences of the deep fading subcarriers and then forms them into a short-OFDM frame, which is allocated dynamically and adaptively to the subcarreirs of idle users to transmit. Computer simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme over the traditional schemes in the BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCAA.2010.5632504","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronautics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronautics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618727/5632200/05632504.pdf","startPage":"1178","endPage":"1181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCAA.2010.5632504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5632200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel group frequency-hopping scheme for OFDM modulated multiuser system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632504/","displayDocTitle":"A novel group frequency-hopping scheme for OFDM modulated multiuser system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11649637","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5632504/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel group frequency-hopping scheme for OFDM modulated multiuser system","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"WeL306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055911S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618727","isNumber":"5632200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618727","xplore-issue":"5632200","articleId":"5632504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5632510,"authors":[{"name":"He-Guang Su","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"He-Guang","lastName":"Su","id":"37539417700"},{"name":"Ming-Qiu Wang","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Ming-Qiu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539558300"},{"name":"Shu-Tao Xia","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Shu-Tao","lastName":"Xia","id":"37288202600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5632510","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Parity check codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Equations","Bit error rate","Error probability","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["puncturing scheme","rate-compatible LDPC codes","additive white Gaussian noise channels","AWGN channels","low-density parity-check code","punctured nodes","survived check nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","rate-compatible","Tanner graph","puncturing"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of finding good puncturing patterns for rate-compatible LDPC codes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of multiple survived check nodes and afford theoretical analysis to them. Based on the analysis, we propose an effective puncturing scheme called MSCN, which maximizes the number of survived check nodes. The MSCN scheme is quite different from the grouping and sorting scheme in the rules of finding nodes and update. By simulations, the MSCN scheme is shown to be superior to the grouping and sorting scheme over AWGN channels at low rates for rate-compatible LDPC codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective puncturing scheme for rate-compatible LDPC codes","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5632510","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5632510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05632510.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5632510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An effective puncturing scheme for rate-compatible LDPC codes","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5632510/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652107","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective puncturing scheme for rate-compatible LDPC codes","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569332266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057705S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5632510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5632559,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Shantou University, Shantou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Jun Wang","id":"37087146257"},{"name":"Yan Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Shantou University, Shantou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Yan Zhao","id":"37089052305"},{"name":"Ping Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Shantou University, Shantou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Ping Liu","id":"37089049821"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6045-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6043-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6044-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7505-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5632559","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Particle swarm optimization","Kernel","Complexity theory","Classification algorithms","Gallium","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","particle swarm optimization","pattern recognition","one-dimension searching method","classification problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5632559","abstract":"Forming an efficient feature space for classification problems is a grand challenge in pattern recognition.

The relationship between the errors of magnetic field magnitude, gradients and the variation of platform attitude and its effect on localization precision of vehicle are studied theoretically and simulated numerically. The results show that the effect of vehicle attitude variation on magnetic field magnitude and gradients are small and obvious, respectively. However, the distance between magnetic target and the device is not nearly varied. A new method calculating vehicle attitude variation by magnetic moments of the target is studied theoretically and simulated numerically. The results show the calculating precision for the novel method is higher in principle, which can be used to detect the attitude of underwater vehicle.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronautics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618727/5632200/05633068.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"792","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronautics","doi":"10.1109/ISSCAA.2010.5633068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCAA.2010.5633068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5632200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle attitude detection in underwater magnetic anomaly localization experiment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Magnetometers","Magnetic field measurement","Magnetic fields","Mathematical model","Equations","Underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attitude measurement","geomagnetism","navigation","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle attitude detection","underwater magnetic anomaly localization experiment","magnetic target","underwater vehicle","magnetic field magnitude","target gradients","geomagnetic field anomaly","magnetic dipole target"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle attitude detection in underwater magnetic anomaly localization experiment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11649756","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle attitude detection in underwater magnetic anomaly localization experiment","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"TuM503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052233S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618727","isNumber":"5632200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618727","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5632200","articleId":"5633068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5633070,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Information Processing, Department of Mathematics,  College of Science, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China"],"lastName":"Xin Chen","id":"37087212518"},{"name":"Fei Long","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Information Processing, College of Computer Science and Information, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China"],"lastName":"Fei Long","id":"37087457010"},{"name":"Zhumu Fu","affiliation":["Electronic Information Engineering College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China"],"lastName":"Zhumu Fu","id":"37087746664"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6045-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6043-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6044-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7505-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633070","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Artificial neural networks","Adaptive systems","Adaptation model","Approximation methods","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model reference","adaptive neural network control","switched nonlinear singular systems","RBF neural network","state tracking controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633070","abstract":"In this paper, we address the reference model adaptive neural network control problem for a class of switched nonlinear singular systems under the case of single input and multiple inputs.

However, it is difficult to design asynchronous controllers on them because the circuit may suffer from hazard problems. This paper presents a method that implements a class of asynchronous controllers on FPGAs which are based on Look-Up Table (LUT) architectures. Asynchronous controllers specification used in heterogeneous (synchronous +asynchronous) systems rely on two types of signals: level sensitive signals that are used as conditionals and transition sensitive signals. Another requirement is to describe concurrency between inputs/outputs. The Multi-Burst Graph (MBG) specification allows to described these controllers in a compact form and also the MBG specification is familiar to the designers of digital circuits. This paper also proposes a generalization in the MBG specification to increase the ability to describe the interaction between inputs/ outputs. Our method begins from Generalized MBG specification. By doing this, the asynchronous circuits besides their intrinsic advantages over synchronous ones may also take advantage of integration, lower costs and short-time design associated with FPGA designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE ANDESCON","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620996/5629654/05633258.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE ANDESCON","doi":"10.1109/ANDESCON.2010.5633258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANDESCON.2010.5633258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of asynchronous controllers from generalized multi-burst graph specification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hazards","Field programmable gate arrays","Concurrent computing","Logic gates","Asynchronous circuits","Table lookup","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","graph theory","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","generalized multiburst graph specification","look-up table architectures","asynchronous controllers specification","heterogeneous systems","level sensitive signals","transition sensitive signals","FPGA designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["asynchronous logic","burst-mode","FPGA","hazard","multi-burst graph","synthesis","XBM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of asynchronous controllers from generalized multi-burst graph specification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633258/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649543","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of asynchronous controllers from generalized multi-burst graph specification","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040756S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620996","isNumber":"5629654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620996","xplore-issue":"5629654","articleId":"5633258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5633284,"authors":[{"name":"Admir Barolli","affiliation":["Center of Asian and Pacific Studies, Seikei University, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Admir","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37590382400"},{"name":"Makoto Takizawa","affiliation":["Department of Computers and Information Science, Seikei University, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Takizawa","id":"37279376800"},{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Department of Languages and Informatics Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"},{"name":"Leonard Barolli","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37267114100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8448-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4236-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633284","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":800},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Routing","Ad hoc networks","Heuristic algorithms","Delays","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","genetic algorithms","mobile radio","quality of service","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","QoS","mobile ad hoc networks","quality of service","data traffic","network routing","NP-complete problem","GAMAN algorithm","GLBR algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithms","Intelligent Algorithms","Ad-Hoc Networks","Routing Algorithms","QoS Routing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633284","abstract":"Much work has been done on routing in Ad-Hoc networks, but the proposed routing solutions only deal with the best effort data traffic. Connections with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as voice channels with delay and bandwidth constraints, are not supported. The QoS routing has been receiving increasingly intensive attention, but searching for the shortest path with many metrics is an NP-complete problem. For this reason, approximated solutions and heuristic algorithms should be developed for multi-path constraints QoS routing. Also, the routing methods should be adaptive, flexible, and intelligent. In this paper, we survey the research work on application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for QoS routing in Ad-Hoc Networks. We present different approaches and give a comparison study between GA-based routing algorithms: GAMAN and GLBR. The performance evaluation via simulations shows that the GAMAN algorithm has better behaviour than GAMAN1 and GLBR algorithms and is a promising algorithm for QoS routing in Ad-Hoc networks. Finally, we discuss some improvements of GAMAN and investigated some future work.","doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2010.78","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629468/5630027/05633284.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"259","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BWCCA.2010.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5630027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Genetic Algorithms for QoS Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Application of Genetic Algorithms for QoS Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11642009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5633284/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Genetic Algorithms for QoS Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"4236a250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05012S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629468","isNumber":"5630027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629468","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5630027","articleId":"5633284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5633306,"authors":[{"name":"Junhua Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Junhua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37599023500"},{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293538200"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633306","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Digital signal processing","Approximation methods","Interference","Cognitive radio","Fading","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decoding","nonlinear programming","optimisation","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal one-dimensional relay placement","cognitive radio network","secondary user","outage constraint","selection decode-and-forward relay protocol","nonlinear optimization problem","approximation formulation","close-optimal relay location","relay placement problem"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we find the optimal relay location for a secondary user in a cognitive radio network subject to outage constraints.

Before applying an air quality model, it is required to accurately estimate the biogenic emission. The assessment of the background ozone concentration is essential for this estimation. It has been known that the biogenic ozone level in urban areas is changing over the years, and hence information about the temporal trends in air quality data is helpful for the assessment. This paper presents a neural-network metamodel for prediction of the background ozone level in the Sydney basin. Based on measured monitoring data under non-photochemical conditions collected at a number of monitoring stations, the proposed model can reliably provide short-term predictions in the biogenic ozone trends to be used for analysis of ground-level emission impact on air quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633376/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11641885","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633376/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Metamodel for Short-Term Prediction of Background Ozone Level","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Metamodel for Short-Term Prediction of Background Ozone Level","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068702S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629470","isNumber":"5632213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629470","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5632213","articleId":"5633376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5633380,"authors":[{"name":"Vishwanath Ramamurthi","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vishwanath","lastName":"Ramamurthi","id":"37592163700"},{"name":"Wei-Peng Chen","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei-Peng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279190400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8448-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4236-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633380","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":647},"abstract":"As the demand for mobile broadband services are growing, cellular networks are heading towards their fourth generation (4G). Long Term Evolution - Advanced (LTE-A) is emerging as a major candidate for 4G cellular networks. MIMO technology combined with OFDMA is a major technological change in 4G compared to their 3G counterparts. However various MIMO configurations and modulation/coding schemes(MCS) need to be carefully tuned to derive the promised gains of MIMO technology. In this paper we evaluate the performance of different MIMO configurations and MCSs in the downlink of LTE-based cellular networks. We propose a signal-to-noise-ratio(SNR) cum mobility based MIMO/MCS link adaptation to enhance the overall performance of the LTE downlink.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on

This paper studies the optimization problem of energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), with the main focuses on the optimality of K out of N fusion strategy and cooperative-user number. The procedures for optimizing the fusion strategy under both the Neyman-Pearson (N-P) and Bayesian criteria are given, and the numerical results demonstrate that the optimal strategy outperforms others, with the maximum collective detection probability under N-P criterion, and the minimum detection risk under Bayesian criterion. Further, the optimal number of cooperative users is investigated, as a solution to the tradeoff between the cooperative spectrum sensing performance and the total sensing overhead. It is shown that the required sensing reliability and minimization of the sensing overhead can be guaranteed simultaneously, if only the local detection threshold and the fusion strategy are properly set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633442/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11652250","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633442/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569323729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073641S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5633449,"authors":[{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"},{"name":"Chungang Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chungang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404777500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633449","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Power control","Games","Convergence","Cognitive radio","Cognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","Markov processes","multi-agent systems","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markovian game-theoretical power control","cognitive radio networks","multi-agent learning","primary users","Nash equilibrium solution","multi-agent Q-learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Markov game","Multi-agent system","resource management","power control","cognitive radio network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markovian game-theoretical power control approach in cognitive radio networks: A multi-agent learning perspective","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633449","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633449","abstract":"Due to the lack of learning and adaptation abilities in traditional game models, e.g., the strategic Nash game, they can't describe the dynamic behaviors and strategy interactive selections well in the cognitive context. The Markov game theoretical modeling approach is investigated to deal with the power control in the cognitive radio (CR) context, which well captures the learning and adaptation abilities of CRs. With the complex interaction relationship of multiple secondary users (SUs), multiple primary users (PUs) with wireless coexistent environment into consideration, both the secondary overall utility maximization and fairness among the SUs are considered from the mathematical model formulation and the algorithm design perspective. A power control approach to searching for the fair and optimal Nash equilibrium solution (NES) based on the improved multi-agent Q-learning is proposed. Meanwhile, the parameters of the presented algorithm are analyzed through simulations. The numerical results confirm that the proposed algorithm can improve the system utility and also guarantee the fairness among the SUs well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11652257","htmlLink":"/document/5633449/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Markovian game-theoretical power control approach in cognitive radio networks: A multi-agent learning perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markovian game-theoretical power control approach in cognitive radio networks: A multi-agent learning perspective","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569326026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054293S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5633450,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Peng","affiliation":["ChongQing Communication College, Chongqing, China","ICE PLAUST, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Peng","id":"37536557400"},{"name":"Chunlan Lu","affiliation":["ICE PLAUST, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chunlan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37599801000"},{"name":"Yingsong Zhang","affiliation":["ICE PLAUST, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yingsong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37069495600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633450","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Loading","Wire","Loaded antennas","Coils","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","genetic algorithms","method of moments","UHF antennas","wire antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF wide bandwidth omni-directional wire antenna","genetic algorithm","ultra-wide antenna","method of moment","middle element","lumped element","horizontal radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithms","lumped element loading","H-plane gain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633450","abstract":"In this paper, a small ultra-wide antenna is proposed based on the Genetic Algorithms and MOM.

In phase I, each user node transmits its own information which is received by the base station (BS) as well as the other user nodes; in phase II, each partner node relays a processed version of the information received in the previous phase. Two iterative detectors are developed at the B S to combat multiple access interference (MAI). The first one named as PDA+LDPC-I performs detection just in the latter phase. The second one named as PDA+LDPC-II operates in both phases. During the latter phase, it firstly eliminates the signals corresponding to the users which were correctly decoded in the former phase, then performs detection on the resultant signals. Simulation results demonstrate that PDA+LDPC-II outperforms PDA+LDPC-I.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633462","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633462.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PDA+LDPC iterative detector for cooperative CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633462/","displayDocTitle":"PDA+LDPC iterative detector for cooperative CDMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652078","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633462/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PDA+LDPC iterative detector for cooperative CDMA networks","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569326158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046458S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5633476,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37268994500"},{"name":"Ciaran Toal","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Ciaran","lastName":"Toal","id":"37265565400"},{"name":"Dwayne Burns","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Dwayne","lastName":"Burns","id":"37589102200"},{"name":"Vicent Fusco","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Vicent","lastName":"Fusco","id":"37438605100"},{"name":"Colin Cowan","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Cowan","id":"37271886100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633476","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":655},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","OFDM","Bandwidth","Pulse shaping methods","Quantization","Physical layer","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filters","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit filter design","receive filter design","OFDM","WLAN systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless local area network systems","square root raised cosine pulses","RRC pulses"]}],"abstract":"We analyze the effect of different pulse shaping filters on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless local area network (LAN) systems in this paper.

The conventional DFT-based channel estimation methods improve the performance by neglecting nonsignificant channel taps. However, the error floor occurs at high signal-to-noise when useful channel information is discarded, especially in non-sample-spaced channel. To solve this problem, we propose a modified DFT-based channel estimation method. Based on the noise power estimated in the frequency domain, which does not suffer from the energy leakage of channel path, we design the threshold for detecting the significant channel taps. Moreover, a wider region with fixed width is designed to decrease the energy loss of channel. Simulation results show that the proposed method is robust to the distribution of channel paths, and the error floor is eliminated.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633515","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633515.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust DFT-based channel estimation for burst OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust DFT-based channel estimation for burst OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633515/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652144","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5633515/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust DFT-based channel estimation for burst OFDM systems","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569330582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059975S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5633521,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwen Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37593004800"},{"name":"Hang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539396700"},{"name":"Shaofan Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Information Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaofan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37597426800"},{"name":"Desheng Zhu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Desheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37591907600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633521","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633521","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Sensors","Covariance matrix","Complexity theory","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalue spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","weak signal detection probability","eigenvalue-based detection scheme","random matrix theory","decision thresholds","receiver node selection","computational complexity","detection performance loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","spectrum sensing","eigenvalue","random matrix theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633521","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633521.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and improvement of eigenvalue spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In order to improve the detection probability of weak signals, a new eigenvalue-based detection scheme is used in cognitive radio system and attracts more attention.

This paper, based on such new theory, presents a novel multiple description coding (MDC) method to combat packet loss. According to compressive sensing framework, our method has an attractive property that the reconstruction error only depends on the received measurement number but not on which measurements are received. Another advantage of our method is that it is a balanced MDC scheme with fine description granularity and low encoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633522","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing-based multiple description image coding for wireless channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing-based multiple description image coding for wireless channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633522/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652150","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5633522/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing-based multiple description image coding for wireless channel","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569329766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04234S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5633530,"authors":[{"name":"Da Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Da","lastName":"Chen","id":"37592681000"},{"name":"Daiming Qu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Daiming","lastName":"Qu","id":"37274417000"},{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279307300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633530","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":765},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Prototypes","Optimization","Transmitters","Modulation","Receivers","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","cognitive radio","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prototype filter design","FBMC","cognitive radio system","direct optimization","filter coefficient","filter bank multicarrier","nearly perfect reconstruction filter","NPR filter","sidelobe suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filter bank multicarrier","cognitive radio","sidelobe suppression","prototype filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633530","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633530","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel strategy of filter design for filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) based cognitive radio (CR) systems, and the key idea is to directly optimize the filter coefficients with the objective and constraints of sidelobe suppression.

The core task of multiuser MIMO system is to suppress multiuser interference and enhance the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). As a classical MIMO scheme, block diagonalization (BD) algorithm could eliminate the multiuser interference completely. Unfortunately, it also reduces the desired receive power and then has capacity loss especially at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). On the other extreme, eigenvalue based beamforming (EBB) maximizes the useful power of receive signals and takes no action to depress multiuser interference making it an interference limited system with high SNRs. Based on such observations, this paper proposes an appropriate combination of the above two schemes. In order to reduce the computing complexity of the proposed scheme, we present an alternative algorithm named as interference sorting (IS). Simulations over spatial channel model (SCM) are carried out with framework of 3GPP LTE technical specifications. It is verified that proposed scheme leads to a remarkable capacity improvement both with low and high SNRs. And the IS algorithm could reduce the complexity of system significantly with indistinguishable performance loss.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633549.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block diagonalization eigenvalue based beamforming precoding design for downlink capacity improvement in multiuser MIMO channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Antennas","MIMO","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","array signal processing","channel capacity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block diagonalization eigenvalue","beamforming precoding design","downlink capacity improvement","multiuser MIMO channel","3rd generation partner project","3GPP","long term evolution","LTE downlink system","interference sorting","spatial channel model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Block diagonalization eigenvalue based beamforming precoding design for downlink capacity improvement in multiuser MIMO channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633549/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652194","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block diagonalization eigenvalue based beamforming precoding design for downlink capacity improvement in multiuser MIMO channel","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569328262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03009S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5633556,"authors":[{"name":"Dewei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dewei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37601255900"},{"name":"Chaoxing Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chaoxing","lastName":"Yan","id":"37592895400"},{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292551600"},{"name":"Jingming Kuang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingming","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37266716500"},{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37571938800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633556","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":697},"abstract":"In this paper, based on analyzing the detector characteristics of modified Gardner (mGA) timing error detector examined before, an extended non-carrier-blind detector is proposed for quadratic phase shift keying (QPSK) signals.

The optimization is a mixed integer programming problem over the sub-carrier allocation to each user, sub-carrier pairing at the relay, the power allocation of each user, and the power allocation at the relay. With the aid of dual decomposition, we find the near optimal solutions with acceptable complexity. To further reduce the complexity, we present a suboptimal algorithm which sacrifices very little on the performance. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633601","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633601.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint resource allocation scheme for multi-relay aided uplink multi-user OFDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633601/","displayDocTitle":"A joint resource allocation scheme for multi-relay aided uplink multi-user OFDMA system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652231","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633601/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint resource allocation scheme for multi-relay aided uplink multi-user OFDMA system","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569333212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100136S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5633618,"authors":[{"name":"J Reyes","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Centro de Desarrollo Technol\u00f3gico del GAs"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Reyes","id":"37587400800"},{"name":"A Acevedo","affiliation":["Universidade Industrial de Santander, Colombia"],"firstName":"A","lastName":"Acevedo","id":"37585975100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6742-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6740-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6741-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633618","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Temperature measurement","Acoustics","Atmospheric modeling","Equations","Instruments","Fluid flow measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic waves","flowmeters","Helmholtz equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transit time","ultrasonic gas flow meter","air","acoustic wave","Heimholte integral ray trace method","wave propagation","transducers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasonic Flow meter","Transit Time","Helmontz Integral Ray Trace Method","Flow Gas Measurement"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and experimental validation of a transit time in an ultrasonic gas flow meter using air","doi":"10.1109/ANDESCON.2010.5633618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629654","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE ANDESCON","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE ANDESCON","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620996/5629654/05633618.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANDESCON.2010.5633618","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633618","abstract":"This paper presents the simulation and validation of the algorithm that determines the transit time of the acoustic wave in an ultrasonic flow meter using air.

Lots of research and development efforts have been spent in wireless industry, aiming for energy efficient solutions which lead to green wireless communications. In this paper we provide a brief overview on those efforts, with an emphasis on introducing energy efficiency metrics. Since energy efficiency metrics are indicators of efficiency, understanding those metrics provides us a better view on how energy efficiency can be achieved in wireless systems/networks. Observing energy is a concern at every corner of a wireless system/network, we describe those metrics from at component, equipment and system/networks level, respectively. From our observation, energy efficiency metrics for components and equipments have been well established. However, studied for system/network level solutions and metrics deserve more attention. We believe new energy efficient architecture and associated metrics will be the key for the energy consumption problem in wireless industry.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency metrics for green wireless communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Wireless communication","Power demand","Energy consumption","Ad hoc networks","Batteries","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","power meters","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency metrics","green wireless communications","energy consumption","wireless industry","wireless systems-networks","equipment level","component level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency metrics for green wireless communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633634/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652263","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency metrics for green wireless communications","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569350712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052022S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5633635,"authors":[{"name":"Guoru Ding","affiliation":["Institute of communications engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guoru","lastName":"Ding","id":"37586009000"},{"name":"Qihui Wu","affiliation":["Institute of communications engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qihui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290356800"},{"name":"Jinlong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of communications engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280540300"},{"name":"Yuping Gong","affiliation":["Institute of communications engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuping","lastName":"Gong","id":"37590693400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633635","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognition","Databases","Cognitive radio","Mathematical model","Wireless sensor networks","Neodymium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","wireless domain","user domain","policy domain","network domain","multidomain local cognition layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio network","multi-domain cognition","system info","research challenges"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633635","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633635","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","abstract":"The environment cognition of cognitive radio networks (CRN) is extending from wireless domain (WD) to network domain (ND), user domain (UD) and policy domain (PD).

Despite the frequency-domain channel estimation (FDCE) can be performed by the comb pilot arrangement, which is particularly suitable for fast fading channels, its estimate accuracy and channel efficiency are low. In order to combat the disadvantages of TDCE and FDCE, the hybrid-domain channel estimation (HDCE) is proposed based on the hybrid-domain system model (HDSM), where the direct relation between the frequency-domain signals and the channel impulse response (CIR) is given. The HDCE can be performed by both the block and comb pilot arrangements. With the block pilot arrangement, the HDCE can obtain high estimate accuracy as the TDCE. With the comb pilot arrangement, the HDCE can obtain much higher estimate accuracy and channel efficiency compared with the FDCE. The HDCE provides a practical solution of the channel estimation with high accuracy and channel efficiency for the MTMO-OFDM systems over fast fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633636","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems with high efficiency and accuracy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems with high efficiency and accuracy","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633636/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652265","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5633636/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems with high efficiency and accuracy","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569352964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15892S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5633637,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404554700"},{"name":"Xia Lei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Lei","id":"37409537500"},{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37556980400"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633637","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Complexity theory","System performance","Detectors","Interference","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","interference (signal)","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple carrier frequency offsets compensation","interleaved OFDMA systems","interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","multiuser interference","interleaved OFDMA receiver","signal-to-interference ratio"]}],"abstract":"In the uplink of interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, multiuser interference (MUI) occurs due to different carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) from different users at the receiver.

The reduction in the rank of the extended window signal space is obtained through interference cancellation. It is shown that the reduction in rank of the decorrelation matrix improves the performance and user capacity of the extended window decorrelator. Further, it is demonstrated that the edge assisted decorrelator, which also work on the similar principle of interference cancellation, exhibit the identical architectures as that of the RREWD. The results have become more demonstrative by introducing a classification for the decorrelators. The type of signature sequences used in processing the received signal at the receiver decides the class to which the decorrelator may belong. Full signature sequences based decorrelators are considered as the members of class-I while those that used partial/full signature sequences form class-II. A comparison of these two classes of decorrelators is presented to highlight the relative merits.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633651","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633651.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of decorrelator designs for multiuser detection in asynchronous CDMA channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of decorrelator designs for multiuser detection in asynchronous CDMA channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633651/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652278","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5633651/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of decorrelator designs for multiuser detection in asynchronous CDMA channel","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569332604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071691S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5633673,"authors":[{"name":"Xianyi Rui","affiliation":["School of Electronic & Information, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianyi","lastName":"Rui","id":"37066510200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633673","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"abstract":"In this paper, the method of missing data imputation based on the emergent field of compressive sensing for the front end of a speaker identification system in noisy conditions is investigated.

the power efficiency optimization problem in the cognitive radio (CR) networks under both the average packet delay constraints of each CR transmitter (CR-Tx) and the interference constraint at primary receiver (PU-Rx). We propose a cooperative approach to make each CR-Tx know the interference level at the PU-Rx when there is no central control node in the network and no assistant sensors are deployed to do the interference measuring jobs. The power control problem is proved to be a convex problem. Since the powers of CR-Tx nodes are coupled in constraints, we apply the Lagrange relaxation of the coupling constraints method and construct the subgradient iterative algorithm to solve the dual problem in a distributed way. To reduce the payload of the message exchange at each iterative process, an improved algorithm is proposed that could be implemented through Lagrange dual decomposition. Numerical results show that the two algorithms can converge very fast. When the delay constraints of CR users are not very small, it is better to apply the improved algorithm which has a good performance but with a much lower complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11652087","htmlLink":"/document/5633676/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power control based on convex optimization in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power control based on convex optimization in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569332677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064662S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5633682,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Since the patient-related data is significance for medical diagnosis and patients' health-care, the security of distributed data storage is critical need for applications. However, the distributed architecture makes it challenging to build a secure and efficient data storage system due to the resource-constrained nature of sensor node. Besides, due to the lack of physical protection, WBANs are vulnerable to attacks when deployed in hostile environments. In order to address the challenges, we propose a novel secure and efficient data storage scheme with dynamic integrity checking in this paper. Based on the policies of multiple secret sharing, we first propose a secure and efficient patient-related data storage and access scheme for WBANs. Furthermore, to dynamically check the integrity of the distributed data shares, we then propose an efficient data integrity verification scheme based on orthonormal vectors. Finally, the security and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure and practical for WBANs.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633690","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on

detection performance over fading and shadowing channels by using multiple cognitive radio (CR) users. Compared with local spectrum sensing with individual CR user, it can either reduce sensitivity requirements for each CR user or shorten the overall sensing duration. These advantages are from spatial diversity when all cooperative users sense a common primary user. However, in practice, CR users at different locations may receive signals from different primary users, which may confuse the fusion user and result in the loss of communication opportunities. In this paper, we propose a cooperative sensing approach by taking the reliability of each partner user into account. Simulation results illustrate significant performance improvement of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633715","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633715.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633715","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication-oriented cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Communication-oriented cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633715/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633715/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652132","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication-oriented cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569335550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062447S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5633740,"authors":[{"name":"Qiming Tian","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Wenzhou Vocational and Technical College, Wenzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qiming","lastName":"Tian","id":"37590779900"},{"name":"Chuan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37598740900"},{"name":"Guanding Yu","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guanding","lastName":"Yu","id":"37288513300"},{"name":"Aiping Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Aiping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275718700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633740","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Cognitive radio","Mathematical model","Equations","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Capacity planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio spectrum access","finite primary users","infinite secondary users","random channel assignment","Markov chains","user connection rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum access","Markov model","channel assignment"]}],"abstract":"In the cognitive radio networks, the users' spectrum access behavior determines the system capacity and spectrum utilization. There are three classical schemes for cognitive radio spectrum access: the random channel assignment, the reservation based assignment and the non-random channel assignment. In this paper, we study the performance of these schemes in a new scenario: a cognitive radio network with finite primary users and infinite secondary users. We model the users' behavior in these schemes by Markov chains. Moreover, the blocking, transition and dropping probabilities of the secondary users based on the user connection rate are derived as the performance metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the secondary system capacity of these schemes. Numerical results show that the random and non-random channel assignments can get the lowest blocking probability, the reservation based assignment can get the lowest dropping probability, and the non-random channel assignment can provide the most system capacity and avoid the channel handoff for the secondary users.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633740","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633740.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633740","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access with finite primary users and infinite secondary users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access with finite primary users and infinite secondary users","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633740/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652186","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access with finite primary users and infinite secondary users","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569332980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057684S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5633746,"authors":[{"name":"Long Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Guo","id":"37591825400"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277724400"},{"name":"Wenfeng Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenfeng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37400400400"},{"name":"Junquan Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Junquan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37596802800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633746","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Automatic repeat request","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HARQ scheme","irregular LDPC coding","hybrid auto repeat request","packet-based data communication systems","low density parity check codes","noisy channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","Hybrid ARQ","Degree Distribution"]}],"abstract":"The hybrid auto repeat request (HARQ) is an efficient retransmission technique which can guarantee highly reliable communication over noisy channels, and nowadays it has been widely adopted in packet-based data communication systems.

In this scheme, the source transmits the whole codeword to the destination, and only the parity bits are retransmitted, if the decoder fails. Irregular LDPC codes, which have different degrees, are utilized in the proposed HARQ scheme. Before the retransmission, the parity bits have been treated as a set of bits specified by the node's degrees. The nodes with same degree are classified into one subset. When the retransmissions are needed, only the parity bits are retransmitted, and the subset which has the larger degree is transmitted firstly, then the smaller subset is transmitted.

Non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) is regarded as a well-matched technology for CR systems. In these systems, one of the major concerns is the fairness of resource allocation among secondary users. In this paper, a concept of fairness index threshold is defined, which achieves a better tradeoff between the system capacity and fairness.

CR network supports opportunistic spectrum sharing by allowing the secondary users to share the same radio spectrum occupied by the primary users. However, the spectrum sharing by the secondary users should be performed only when the Quality-of-Service (QoS) degradations of primary users due to the spectrum sharing are carefully controlled. The traditional design of the secondary user transmit covariance is to maximize its mutual information while satisfying the interference power constraints induced at the primary receivers. However, in many practical applications, we would like to limit the number of independent data streams of the transmitter to take advantage of the transmit diversity or due to the restrictions from the top layers in the network. In this paper, we focus on a rank-constrained secondary user transmit covariance design problem. We first derive a structural result on the optimal solution of the rank-constrained problem. Based on the solution structure, we transform the rank-constrained problem into an equivalent problem with a unitary constraint. After that, we derive an iterative projected steepest descent algorithm which can converge to a local optimal solution. Furthermore, we shall show that under some special cases, we could even derive closed-form global optimal solution. The numerical results show the superior performance of the our proposed technique over the baseline schemes, the rank relaxation based randomization technique.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633755","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633755.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank-constrained transmit covariance optimization in MIMO cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rank-constrained transmit covariance optimization in MIMO cognitive radio networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633755/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652189","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5633755/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank-constrained transmit covariance optimization in MIMO cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569335318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066774S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5633769,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Mori","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Mori","id":"37594865100"},{"name":"Adam Esch","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Esch","id":"37589881000"},{"name":"Abderazek Ben Abdallah","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Abderazek Ben","lastName":"Abdallah","id":"37085458614"},{"name":"Kenichi Kuroda","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Kuroda","id":"37423108100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8448-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4236-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633769","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"abstract":"Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures provide a good way of realizing efficient interconnections and largely alleviate the limitations of bus-based solutions.

WMNs are showing their applicability in deployment of medical, transport and surveillance applications in urban areas, metropolitan, neighbouring communities and municipal area networks. At the heart of WMNs are the issues of achieving network connectivity and stability as well as QoS in terms of user coverage. These issues are very closely related to the family of node placement problems in WMNs, such as mesh router nodes placement. As these problems are known to be computationally hard to solve, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been recently investigated as effective resolution methods. However, GAs require the user to provide values for a number of parameters and a set of genetic operators to achieve the best GA performance for the problem. The task of tuning parameters and operators is complex and, unfortunately, in most cases a specific GA configuration is needed for the problem under study to achieve high quality solutions. In this work we present the results of an experimental study for tuning the parameters and genetic operators of GA for mesh router nodes placement problem. The results of the study suggested a useful combination of parameter values and genetic operators for the problem, which could well serve as a reference for the family of node placement problems in WMNs solved through evolutionary algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2010.52","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629468/5630027/05633774.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BWCCA.2010.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5630027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning Operators of Genetic Algorithms for Mesh Routers Placement Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuning operators","genetic algorithms","mesh routers","wireless mesh networks","cost-efficient broadband wireless connectivity","medical applications","transport applications","surveillance applications","urban areas","metropolitan","neighbouring communities","municipal area networks","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WMN","GA","Router Placement Problem","Tuning Operators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Tuning Operators of Genetic Algorithms for Mesh Routers Placement Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633774/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11642052","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning Operators of Genetic Algorithms for Mesh Routers Placement Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"4236a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08695S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629468","isNumber":"5630027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629468","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5630027","articleId":"5633774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5633779,"authors":[{"name":"Qihui Liang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qihui","lastName":"Liang","id":"37591479300"},{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37556980400"},{"name":"Xu He","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"He","id":"37407012400"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633779","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Distortion","MIMO","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","error statistics","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO OFDM systems","N-continuous distortion cancellation","N-continuous distortion iterative estimation","out-of-band power radiation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","iterative receiver","multiple input multiple output signals","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["iterative method","N-continuous distortion","multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"N-continuous has been proved to be an effective and simple way in reducing the out-of-band power radiation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals.

In this paper, a novel iterative receiver is proposed to estimate and cancel the distortion caused by N-continuous processing.

This paper puts emphasis on the autonomic cognitive radio nodes architecture for the purpose of establishing a cognitive radio network with autonomic computing property from bottom up. We model the cognitive cycle using autonomic computing principles and introduce an autonomic cognitive radio conceptual model. And then, an autonomic cognitive radio nodes architecture (ACRA) based on the proposed conceptual model and a realization method are proposed. ACRA can realize the cognitive radio function with autonomic computing property, which makes the collaboration and management in a network formed by this kind of node easier.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633818","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633818.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633818","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACRA: An Autonomic and Expandable Architecture for Cognitive Radio Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"ACRA: An Autonomic and Expandable Architecture for Cognitive Radio Nodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633818/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652240","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACRA: An Autonomic and Expandable Architecture for Cognitive Radio Nodes","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569333151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062176S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5633819,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Huo","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Huo","id":"37588447000"},{"name":"Tianxi Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Space Long March Vehicle, China"],"firstName":"Tianxi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600495500"},{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Lingyang","lastName":"Song","id":"37288632100"},{"name":"Bingli Jiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Bingli","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37282213500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633819","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Approximation methods","Cooperative systems","Protocols","Diversity reception","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic redundancy check codes","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid forward cooperative communication","decode and forward scheme","amplify and forward scheme","all participate hybrid forward scheme","cyclic redundancy check","FER approximation model","frame error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative network","all-participate hybrid forward","frame error rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633819","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633819.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-participate hybrid forward cooperative communications with multiple relays","abstract":"Cooperative communication significantly improves system performance and capacity by transmitting the same information through relays.

Since joint processing is too costly (complexity wise), MIMO and channel decoding have to be performed separately on the expenses of performance. Using iterative reception, it is possible to approach capacity limits. LDPC codes have been used in many standards and seem to be an interesting solution for iterative receivers. The problem of LDPC design for iterative MIMO receivers have been addressed in the literature using Density Evolution and EXIT charts techniques. In this paper we consider LDPC coded iterative MIMO receiver and we show that MIMO LDPC iterative reception can be designed and scheduled in a complexity and energy efficient manner without significant loss of performance.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633822","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620887/5629524/05633822.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo-equalization of LDPC coded MIMO inner/outer scheduling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633822/","displayDocTitle":"Turbo-equalization of LDPC coded MIMO inner/outer scheduling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652243","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633822/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo-equalization of LDPC coded MIMO inner/outer scheduling","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1569332888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066486S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620887","isNumber":"5629524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620887","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5629524","articleId":"5633822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5633835,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Dandach","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Dandach","id":"37590344400"},{"name":"Pierre Siohan","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Siohan","id":"37293775600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633835","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Shape","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Prototypes","Demodulation","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet transmission","overlapped offset QAM","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","single carrier transmission","multicarrier transmission","OFDM","demodulation process"]}],"abstract":"Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OQAM) presents several advantages for single carrier and multicarrier transmission when combined with OFDM.

It is the most important step that affects the performance of a pattern recognition system. This paper presents a novel feature selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO is a computational paradigm based on the idea of collaborative behavior inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. The algorithm is applied to coefficients extracted by two feature extraction techniques: the discrete wavelet transform (DMWT). The proposed PSO-based feature selection algorithm is utilized to search the feature space for the optimal feature subset where features are carefully selected according to a well defined discrimination criterion. Evolution is driven by a fitness function defined in terms of maximizing the class separation (scatter index). The classifier performance and the length of selected feature vector are considered for performance evaluation using the ORL face database. Experimental results show that the PSO-based feature selection algorithm was found to generate excellent recognition results with the minimal set of selected features. In this paper, a face recognition algorithm using a PSO-based feature selection approach is presented. The algorithm utilizes a novel approach that employs the binary PSO algorithm to effectively explore the solution space for the optimal feature subset. The selection algorithms applied to feature vectors extracted using the DMWT. The search heuristics in PSO is iteratively adjusted guided by a fitness function defined in terms of maximizing class separation. The proposed algorithm was found to generate excellent recognition results witless selected features then the main contribution of this work: The first contribution is formulation of a new feature selection algorithm for face recognition based on the binary PSO algorithm. The algorithm is applied to DMWT feature vectors and is used to search for the optimal feature subset to increase recognition rate and class separation. Then the second contribution is evaluation of the proposed algorithm using the ORL face database and comparing its performance with a GA-based feature selection algorithm and various FR algorithms found in the literature. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The DMWT feature extraction techniques are described in Section 2. An overview of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in Section 3. In Section 4 we explain the proposed PSO-based feature selection algorithm. Finally, Sections 5 and 6 attain the experimental results and conclusion.","doi":"10.1109/DeSE.2010.39","startPage":"199","endPage":"204","publicationTitle":"2010 Developments in E-systems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DeSE.2010.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629955","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Developments in E-systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629471/5629955/05633844.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Mixed between Selected Feature by Multiwavelet and Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633844/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Mixed between Selected Feature by Multiwavelet and Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633844/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11652681","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Based on Mixed between Selected Feature by Multiwavelet and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4160a199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067247S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629471","isNumber":"5629955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629471","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5629955","articleId":"5633844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5633847,"authors":[{"name":"Xueqin Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xueqin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37403103700"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moon Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279700800"},{"name":"Ying Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Guo","id":"37403660700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7555-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7556-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7553-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7554-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633847","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Encoding","Complexity theory","Detectors","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","parity check codes","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density MIMO codes","multiple parity-check codes","LDMC codes","transmitter side","inner-iterations","outer-iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","detector","decoder","LDPC codes","LDMC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new approach to construct LDMC codes is introduced.

In the first RA-Game, each PU selects the expected quantities of sub-channels to achieve the highest payoff. Then in the second tier game, namely PS-Game, each PU sells his unused radios to SUs nearby, which is performed as an auction game. In addition, we investigate the existence of Nash equilibria of the two games, which shows our mechanism can efficiently achieve load balance. Furthermore, we propose distributed algorithms including radio allocation and PU selection, which are performed by PUs and SUs independently in a distributed manner.

Simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to that of adopting complementary sequence as dummy sequence one.","doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2010.147","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629468/5630027/05633883.pdf","startPage":"639","endPage":"642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BWCCA.2010.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5630027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization on DSI Method for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5633883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5633883/","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization on DSI Method for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11642100","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5633883/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization on DSI Method for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"4236a639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036931S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629468","isNumber":"5630027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629468","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5630027","articleId":"5633883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5633899,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hsin Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277349000"},{"name":"Kai-Jie Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Jie","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596855800"},{"name":"Gwo-Ruey Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Taipei Municipal University of Education, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Gwo-Ruey","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293699800"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8448-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4236-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5633899","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Least squares approximation","Adaptive filters","Convergence","Phase noise","Interference","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","errors","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase error cancellation","OFDM systems","adaptive filters","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high rate wireless transmissions","step size delta least mean square method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","LMS algorithm","Common phase error","interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multi-plexing (OFDM) is a significant technology to provide a high-rate wireless transmissions.

On the other hand, the small window width leads to the difficulty to set the threshold of entropy value over the small available threshold value area. In this research, we propose the calculation method of the dynamic threshold varying the time sequence.

Since the semiconductor optical amplifier-based fiber-optic delay loop has an infinite impulse response that varies from a large positive value to negative infinity on a log scale, a unique relationship between the output power, and the frequency of the input continuous-wave (CW) microwave signal is established. Meanwhile, it is experimentally shown that the use of the ILS can greatly improve the stability of the proposed IFM system. When the input power of CW microwave signal is within the range of -7 dBm to -16 dBm, the measured errors remain within \u00b1400 KHz over a frequency range of 6.94-6.958 GHz. The measurement error, the complexity and cost of the proposed IFM system can be considerably reduced by only using one ILS, one modulator, and one photodetector. Since the proposed IFM system has a capability of optical integration, it is theoretically estimated that the measurement range can be extended to 20 GHz with a measurement resolution of 1.36 dB/GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5634047/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"11733353","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous Microwave Frequency Measurement Based on Amplified Fiber-Optic Recirculating Delay Loop and BroadBand Incoherent Light Source","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous Microwave Frequency Measurement Based on Amplified Fiber-Optic Recirculating Delay Loop and BroadBand Incoherent Light Source","sourcePdf":"jlt-fu-2091945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071995S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5672498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5672498","articleId":"5634047","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5634050,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan B.

In this scheme, BCH code is used as inner code and low-density parity-check (LDPC) code as outer code. The BCH decoder is implemented based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding such as the BCJR/Ashikmin's algorithm, and an LDPC decoder is based on a min-sum-with-correction-term algorithm. Because maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding is used as the inner decoder, it provides high accuracy reliabilities to be used in LDPC decoding. We show that proposed FEC scheme performs comparably with much longer LDPC codes of girth 12 for a smaller number of LDPC decoder iterations. Because the outer LDPC code is of medium length and the number of required iterations is low, the proposed concatenated scheme represents an interesting candidate to be used in beyond 100-Gb/s optical transmission. The net coding gain (NCG) of concatenated LDPC(16935,14819)-BCH(64,57) code is 9.62 dB at a bit error rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n, whereas the expected NCG at BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-13</sup>\n is 11.38 dB.

The new scheme adopts turbo block decision-feedback equalization, where the soft-decision equalizer performs successive soft interference cancellation of both the intersymbol interference in the time domain, and the multiplexing interference in the space domain. Attributed to the inherent advantage of the block decision-feedback equalizer (BDFE) over other conventional equalizers, the MIMO turbo detection algorithm provides high performance with fast convergence speed. With the interblock interference properly removed, the MIMO BDFE is performed with overlapped information blocks without guard intervals, thus a high transmission efficiency is guaranteed and the performance degradation at the tail of each block is prevented. The MIMO channel is treated as time invariant over each small block, and is estimated with either the pilot symbols in the training mode or the previously detected symbols in the decision-directed mode. The proposed detection scheme has been tested by extensive experimental data and proved to be robust to different transmission environments. The experimental results for the undersea 2008 Surface Processes and Acoustic Communications Experiment (SPACE08) and the 2008 Gulf of Mexico Experiment (GOMEX08) are both reported.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2010.2077831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5638587/05634060.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2010.2077831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MIMO Underwater Acoustic Communications Using Turbo Block Decision-Feedback Equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634060/","displayDocTitle":"Robust MIMO Underwater Acoustic Communications Using Turbo Block Decision-Feedback Equalization","volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11673999","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634060/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MIMO Underwater Acoustic Communications Using Turbo Block Decision-Feedback Equalization","sourcePdf":"joe-xiao-2077831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113536S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5638587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5638587","articleId":"5634060","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5634069,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Parizzi","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Parizzi","id":"37596648100"},{"name":"Ramon Brcic","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Brcic","id":"37285065300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5634069","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"Efficient estimation of the interferometric phase and complex correlation is fundamental for the full exploitation of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) capabilities. Particularly, when combining interferometric measures arising both from distributed and concentrated targets, the interferometric phase has to be correctly extracted in order to preserve its physical meaning. Recently, an amplitude-based algorithm for the adaptive multilooking of InSAR stacks was proposed where it was shown that a comparison of the backscatter amplitude statistics is a suitable way to adaptively group and average the pixels in order to preserve the phase signatures of natural structures in the observed area. In this letter, different methods to compare amplitude statistics will be presented, compared through simulation and applied to real data. Based on these, recommendations are made concerning which method to use in practice.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Synthetic aperture radar","Shape","Coherence","Remote sensing","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","radar imaging","radar interferometry","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive InSAR stack multilooking","interferometric phase","complex correlation","interferometric synthetic aperture radar capability","amplitude-based algorithm","backscatter amplitude statistics","phase signatures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive multilooking","coherence estimation","interferometry","radar backscatter statistics","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2010.2083631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5753305/05634069.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2010.2083631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive InSAR Stack Multilooking Exploiting Amplitude Statistics: A Comparison Between Different Techniques and Practical Results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive InSAR Stack Multilooking Exploiting Amplitude Statistics: A Comparison Between Different Techniques and Practical Results","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634069/","volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634069/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11961160","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive InSAR Stack Multilooking Exploiting Amplitude Statistics: A Comparison Between Different Techniques and Practical Results","sourcePdf":"lgrs-parizzi-2083631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048836S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5753305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"5753305","articleId":"5634069","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5634078,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To achieve an ultra-high sensitivity in the detection of bio-molecules, the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) looks very promising as a sensor for the magnetic signal that are related to the concentration of the detected bio-molecules. We had developed a single channel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometer, but for increasing the detection through-put, we have developed a multi-channel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometer. In this work, the design and the working principle of a 4-channel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometer are introduced. By utilizing scanning technology, 4 samples can be logged into a SQUID-based magnetosusceptometer simultaneously. Be noted that only one single SQUID magnetometer has been used in the magnetosusceptometer. The precision and the sensitivity of detecting bio-molecules by using a 4-channel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometer have been investigated. The detected bio-molecules are biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2010.2087304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5776769/05634078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2010.2087304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5776769","startPage":"477","endPage":"480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Channel SQUID-Based Ultra-High-Sensitivity In-Vitro Detections for Bio-Markers of Alzheimer's Disease Via Immunomagnetic Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Channel SQUID-Based Ultra-High-Sensitivity In-Vitro Detections for Bio-Markers of Alzheimer's Disease Via Immunomagnetic Reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12022859","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5634078/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Channel SQUID-Based Ultra-High-Sensitivity In-Vitro Detections for Bio-Markers of Alzheimer's Disease Via Immunomagnetic Reduction","sourcePdf":"tasc-horng-2087304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129495S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5776769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5776769","articleId":"5634078","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5634085,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Saruwatari","affiliation":["Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5772995/5634085/5634085-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroshi Saruwatari (M'00) was born in Nagoya, Japan, on July 27, 1967.

In the proposed algorithm, channelwise spectral subtraction is applied before adaptive array signal processing.

Context-dependent feature selection (CDFS) counteracts environmental uncertainties that degrade detection and discrimination performances by modifying decision rules based on inference of the environmental context. This paper utilized both physics-based and statistical methods for extracting features from GPR data to characterize surface texture and subsurface electrical properties, and a nonparametric hypothesis test was used to identify the environmental context from which the data were collected. The results of probabilistic context identification were then used to fuse an ensemble of classifiers for discriminating landmines from clutter under diverse environmental conditions. CDFS was evaluated on a large set of GPR data collected over several years in different weather and terrain conditions. Results indicate that our context-dependent technique improved landmine discrimination performance over conventional fusion of several currently fielded algorithms from the recent literature.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2084093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5753065/05634094.pdf","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2084093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Ground-Penetrating Radar Phenomenology in a Context-Dependent Framework for Landmine Detection and Discrimination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634094/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Ground-Penetrating Radar Phenomenology in a Context-Dependent Framework for Landmine Detection and Discrimination","volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11960935","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634094/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Ground-Penetrating Radar Phenomenology in a Context-Dependent Framework for Landmine Detection and Discrimination","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ratto-2084093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102464S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5753065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5753065","articleId":"5634094","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5634099,"authors":[{"name":"Emile J.

This protection also includes unlinkability, i.e., preventing cross-matching between two or more reference templates from the same subject across different applications. In the literature, the template protection techniques based on fuzzy commitment, also known as the code-offset construction, have recently been investigated. Recent work presented the decodability attack vulnerability facilitating cross-matching based on the protected templates and its theoretical analysis. First, we extend the theoretical analysis and include the comparison between the system and cross-matching performance. We validate the presented analysis using real biometric data from the MCYT fingerprint database.

To assess the discrimination power of HRV features, we designed a classifier based on the classification and regression tree (CART) method, which is a nonparametric statistical technique, strongly effective on nonnormal medical data mining. The best subset of features for subject classification includes square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD), total power, high-frequencies power, and the ratio between low- and high-frequencies power (LF/HF). The classifier we developed achieved sensitivity and specificity values of 79.3% and 100 %, respectively.

ELITE creates a diverse population via a feature selection procedure of different local optimal neural networks obtained using tier-1 TRUST-TECH search. In addition, the capability of each input-pruned network is fully exploited through a TRUST-TECH-based optimal training. Finally, finding the optimal linear combination weights for an ensemble is modeled as a nonlinear programming problem and solved using TRUST-TECH and the interior point method, where the issue of non-convexity can be effectively handled. Extensive numerical experiments have been carried out for pattern classification on the synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Droop control is widely considered to be a good choice for managing the power flows between microgrid converters in a decentralized manner. In this work, to enhance the power loop dynamics, droop control combined with a derivative controller is used in islanded mode. In grid-connected mode, to strictly control the power factor in the point of common coupling (PCC), a droop method combined with an integral controller is adopted. Small-signal analysis of the proposed control is shown both in islanded and grid-connected mode. The proposed control scheme does not need any mode switching action. Thus, it is relatively simple in control for full mode of operation. Smooth transitions between the operation modes and the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are evaluated through simulation and experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634131/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12004908","volume":"26","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mode Adaptive Droop Control With Virtual Output Impedances for an Inverter-Based Flexible AC Microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode Adaptive Droop Control With Virtual Output Impedances for an Inverter-Based Flexible AC Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tpel-kim-2091685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086707S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"339","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5634131","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5634134,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Piro","affiliation":["DEE-Dip. di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5713041/5634134/5634134-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giuseppe Piro (S'10) received the first-level and second-level degrees (both cum laude) in telecommunications engineering from the Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering.","In June 2009 and November 2009, he collaborated with Planete Project\u2013INRIA, Sophia Antipolis, France, as a Research Assistant.

The effectiveness of the proposed simulator has been tested and verified considering 1) the software scalability test, which analyzes both memory and simulation time requirements; and 2) the performance evaluation of a realistic LTE network providing a comparison among well-known scheduling strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2091660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5713041/05634134.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2091660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulating LTE Cellular Systems: An Open-Source Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Simulating LTE Cellular Systems: An Open-Source Framework","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5634134/","accessionNumber":"11807393","volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulating LTE Cellular Systems: An Open-Source Framework","sourcePdf":"tvt-boggia-2091660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064869S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"425","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5634134","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5634136,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Kuiper","affiliation":["Saab Aeronautics, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5713041/5634136/5634136-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erik Kuiper received the M.S. degree in industrial engineering and management in 2001 from Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden, where he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer science since 2005, as a part of his employment with Saab Aeronautics, Link\u00f6ping.","In 2001, he joined Saab Aeronautics as a Systems Engineer, working on safety-critical software and airborne computer systems."]},"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Kuiper","id":"37297308100"},{"name":"Simin Nadjm-Tehrani","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5713041/5634136/5634136-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Simin Nadjm-Tehrani (M'00) received the B.Sc.

A key enabler for the applications is the routing protocol that directs the packets in the network. Routing packets in fully connected mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has been studied to a great extent, but the assumption on full connectivity is generally not valid in a real system. This case means that a practical routing protocol must handle intermittent connectivity and the absence of end-to-end connections. In this paper, we propose a geographical routing algorithm called location-aware routing for delay-tolerant networks (LAROD), enhanced with a location service, location dissemination service (LoDiS), which together are shown to suit an intermittently connected MANET (IC-MANET). Because location dissemination takes time in IC-MANETs, LAROD is designed to route packets with only partial knowledge of geographic position. To achieve low overhead, LAROD uses a beaconless strategy combined with a position-based resolution of bids when forwarding packets. LoDiS maintains a local database of node locations, which is updated using broadcast gossip combined with routing overhearing. The algorithms are evaluated under a realistic application, i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles deployed in a reconnaissance scenario, using the low-level packet simulator ns-2. The novelty of this paper is the illustration of sound design choices in a realistic application, with holistic choices in routing, location management, and the mobility model. This holistic approach justifies that the choice of maintaining a local database of node locations is both essential and feasible. The LAROD-LoDiS scheme is compared with a leading delay-tolerant routing algorithm (spray and wait) and is shown to have a competitive edge, both in terms of delivery ratio and overhead. For spray and wait, this case involved a new packet-level implementation in ns-2 as opposed to the original connection-level custom simulator.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2091658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5713041/05634136.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2091658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geographical Routing With Location Service in Intermittently Connected MANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634136/","displayDocTitle":"Geographical Routing With Location Service in Intermittently Connected MANETs","volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11807395","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634136/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geographical Routing With Location Service in Intermittently Connected MANETs","sourcePdf":"tvt-kuiper-2091658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058655S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5634136","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5634141,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Hoyos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5702426/5634141/5634141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sebastian Hoyos received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (PUJ), Bogota, Colombia, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Delaware, Newark, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.","He was with Lucent Technologies Inc., Bogota, Colombia, from 1999 to 2000 for the Andean region in South America.

Stringent jitter specifications in the sampling clocks of high-performance single-channel and multichannel time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters severely limit the evolution of baseband receivers. This paper presents an analytical framework for the design of clock-jitter-tolerant low-order multichannel filter-bank receivers, with techniques to dramatically lower the sampling-clock-jitter specifications. Although it is well understood that high-order frequency-channelized receivers provide higher tolerance to sampling jitter, this paper shows that low-order bandwidth-optimized multichannel receivers can achieve similar sampling-jitter tolerance. Additionally, this paper presents design tradeoffs and specifications of an example multichannel receiver that can process a 5-GHz baseband signal with 40 dB of signal-to-noise-ratio using sampling clocks that can tolerate up to 5 p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sup>\n clock jitter.

The main disadvantage of the SLF to date has been the lack of a linear time-invariant (LTI) model with which to perform the system-level design of SLF-based PLLs.

It is based on the weighted least squares (WLS) method, coupled with particular solutions to facilitate the estimation, reducing the noise effect. More precisely, a two steps procedure to reduce the condition number of the input data matrix with optimal trajectory planning, and a method to estimate the variances matrix to be used as a weight matrix for the WLS method are illustrated. Moreover, the identification problem is solved with reference to an MIMO coupled system. A closed loop identification is needed because the system is open loop unstable, and because the robot has to track an optimal reference input so as to correctly execute the identification procedure. Some solutions are also presented to overtake common identification problems, such as the bias of the estimated parameters, the presence of outliers, the necessity of balancing the kinematics of the third link, and the reduction of the sensitivity to noise of the estimate. The presented procedure has been successfully experimentally tested on a COMAU SMART3-S2 industrial manipulator used in a planar configuration.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2077294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5983465/05634145.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2077294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983465","startPage":"1214","endPage":"1224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Closed Loop Identification of an Industrial Robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Closed Loop Identification of an Industrial Robot","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205999","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5634145/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Closed Loop Identification of an Industrial Robot","sourcePdf":"tcst-capisani-2077294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107996S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5983465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5983465","articleId":"5634145","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5634148,"authors":[{"name":"Qing He","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662237/5634148/5634148-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing He received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006.

In this simulator, the physical layout of a large-scale linear network is rigorously reduced to a single surface or a few surfaces where the nonlinear circuits are located. The reduction is done analytically, and, hence, the computational overhead is minimal. The reduced system is then split into a linear system and a nonlinear system so that both systems can be solved efficiently. The linear system of equations is solved rapidly by the time-domain layered finite-element reduction-recovery method. The nonlinear system of equations is solved by developing an efficient method. This method renders the contribution from the linear network to the nonlinear system a diagonal matrix in the Jacobian matrix, hence significantly speeding up the nonlinear solution. After the reduced system is solved, the unknowns elsewhere in the computational domain are recovered efficiently by the time-domain layered finite-element reduction-recovery method. The proposed simulator has been applied to co-simulate on-chip interconnects and CMOS transistors. Numerical results have demonstrated its accuracy and efficiency. The proposed simulator is capable of capturing the global electrical interaction between integrated circuit interconnects, package, RF/analog components, substrates, and nonlinear drivers/receivers across the full electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, it bypasses the extraction of the linear network, preserves the passivity and stability of the linear network, and captures the interaction between the linear network and nonlinear devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634148/","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5634148/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11692648","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast Electromagnetics-Based Co-Simulation of Linear Network and Nonlinear Circuits for the Analysis of High-Speed Integrated Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Electromagnetics-Based Co-Simulation of Linear Network and Nonlinear Circuits for the Analysis of High-Speed Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tmtt-jiao-2086590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112936S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5662237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5662237","articleId":"5634148","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5634151,"authors":[{"name":"Ryosuke Suga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662240/5634151/5634151-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ryosuke Suga (M'08) was born in Tokyo, Japan, on December 31, 1979.

The antenna package provides the end-fire radiation from the open-ended post-wall waveguide built into the side of the package. The antenna package, in which a 60-GHz CMOS chip is attached, is mounted on the edge of a printed circuit board by the ball-grid-array assembly. The fabricated antenna, to be built in the package, had the size of 4.8 mm \u00d7 6.4 mm \u00d7 1.0 mm. The beamwidths of 120\u00b0 (E-plane) and 72\u00b0 (H-plane) and the gain of 2.2 dBi were measured at 60 GHz. The cost-effective antenna package with two antennas for the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) was fabricated.

The theory provides a delta-sigma model to account for the excellent signal-to-noise spectral density ratio in a parametric study of the sensitivity performance. Then, the experiments verify the sensing principle and the predicted performance. Accordingly, a prototype sensor with high sensitivity is realized for noncontact cardiopulmonary monitoring, achieving a long sensing distance without the need for a low-noise amplifier. The sensing distance can grow four times longer by doubling the operating frequency. Furthermore, the sensor using a swept frequency can eliminate the null detection points and the external radio interference. As an experimental result, the sensor, which is placed 4 m away from the subject, can reliably detect the heartbeat signal an the operating frequency of 3.6 GHz and an output power level of 0 dBm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Vital-Sign Sensor Based on a Self-Injection-Locked Oscillator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2087349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5662240/05634153.pdf","startPage":"4112","endPage":"4120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2087349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Vital-Sign Sensor Based on a Self-Injection-Locked Oscillator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5634153/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11692694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Vital-Sign Sensor Based on a Self-Injection-Locked Oscillator","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wang-2087349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072298S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5662240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5662240","articleId":"5634153","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5634156,"authors":[{"name":"Bharadwaj Amrutur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6059694/5634156/5634156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bharadwaj Amrutur (M'08) received the B.Tech. degree in computer science and engineering from Indian Institute of Science, Bombay, India, in 1990 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, in 1994 and 1999, respectively.","He has worked at Bell Labs, Agilent Labs and Greenfield Networks.

The clock nodes are subsampled with a near-frequency asynchronous sampling clock to result in beat signals which are themselves skewed in the same proportion but on a larger time scale. The beat signals are then suitably masked to extract only the skews of the rising edges of the clock signals. We propose a histogram of the arithmetic difference of the beat signals which decouples the relationship of clock jitter to the minimum measurable skew, and allows skews arbitrarily close to zero to be measured with a precision limited largely by measurement time, unlike the conventional XOR based histogram approach. We also analytically show that the proposed approach leads to an unbiased estimate of skew. The measured results from a 65 nm delay measurement front-end indicate that for an input skew range of \u00b11 fan-out-of-4 (FO4) delay, \u00b13\u03c3 resolution of 0.84 ps can be obtained with an integral error of 0.65 ps. We also experimentally demonstrate that a frequency modulation on a sampling clock maintains precision, indicating the robustness of the technique to jitter. We also show how FM modulation helps in restoring precision in case of rationally related clocks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5634156/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328179","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"0.84 ps Resolution Clock Skew Measurement via Subsampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"0.84 ps Resolution Clock Skew Measurement via Subsampling","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-amrutur-2083706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0615S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6059694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6059694","articleId":"5634156","onlineDate":"11 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5634159,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Trullols-Cruces","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Trullols-Cruces","id":"38274127500"},{"name":"Jose M.

This phenomenon encourages the improvement of control methodologies that reduce resource requirements. It has been lately observed that the building sector contributes considerably to final energy demand. For example, electricity used in France by this sector has reached 284 TWh, accounting for 65% of all electricity consumed in 2007 (434 TWh), and this situation continues to increase. Moreover, the link between increased CO2 emissions and the use of energy is also considered, particularly in the building environment. 404 million tones of CO2 gas is emitted in France, and 22.6% originates from this sector. In the light of developments in microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS), along with progress made in communication and embedded smart sensors, the building sector has a huge potential for mitigating demand. This paper deals with techniques and advanced load management strategies for BEMS. First, we present the architecture of this system that exploits several communication techniques. We then describe an application for a heating control which is based on the wireless sensor network (WSN). This application uses an innovative realtime control method that allows peak consumption to be reduced while maintaining thermal comfort. This method is tested and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to control heating loads to adapt to any problems that may arise (by taking into account changing price, signals from energy provider and distribution system operator, etc).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time control using wireless sensor network for intelligent energy management system in buildings","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop on Environmental Energy and Structural Monitoring Systems","doi":"10.1109/EESMS.2010.5634176","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Workshop on Environmental Energy and Structural Monitoring Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5620888/5634163/05634176.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EESMS.2010.5634176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634163","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A real-time control using wireless sensor network for intelligent energy management system in buildings","conferenceDate":"9-9 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634176/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649579","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time control using wireless sensor network for intelligent energy management system in buildings","confLoc":"Taranto, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569333761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046758S","chronDate":"9-9 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5620888","isNumber":"5634163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5620888","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5634163","articleId":"5634176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5634328,"authors":[{"name":"Guibin Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Processing, School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Guibin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404554400"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Ren","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Processing, School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoguang","lastName":"Ren","id":"37397214800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8095-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4190-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"5634328","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1052},"abstract":"As the system scales up continuously, the problem of power consumption for high performance computing (HPC) system becomes more severe. Heterogeneous system integrating two or more kinds of processors, could be better adapted to heterogeneity in applications and provide much higher energy efficiency in theory. Many studies have shown heterogeneous system is preferable on energy consumption to homogeneous system in a multi-programmed computing environment. However, how to exploit energy efficiency (Flops/Watt) of heterogeneous system for a single application or even for a single phase in an application has not been well studied. This paper proposes a power-efficient work distribution method for single application on a CPU-GPU heterogeneous system. The proposed method could coordinate inter-processor work distribution and per-processor's frequency scaling to minimize energy consumption under a given scheduling length constraint. We conduct our experiment on a real system, which equips with a multi-core CPU and a multi-threaded GPU. Experimental results show that, with reasonably distributing work over CPU and GPU, the method achieves 14% reduction in energy consumption than static mappings for several typical benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our method could adapt to changes in scheduling length constraint and hardware configurations.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed

mapping (DM) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based transmission scheme for underwater acoustic multimedia (UAM). We adopt DM multi-input multi-output (MIMO), power assignment mechanism, OFDM, adaptive modulation, and unequal error protection in the UAM system. The proposed underwater acoustic multimedia system employs high power, low speed modulation, and schemes providing significant error protection for the transmission of sensor data messages requiring a stringent bit-error rate (BER). In contrast, low power, high speed modulation, and less capable error protection schemes are provided for messages that can tolerate a high BER. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can not only fulfill the quality of services (QoS) required by a UAM system, but also achieve the mission of maximum transmission bit rates or minimum transmission power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Mapping OFDM-Based Transmission Scheme for Underwater Acoustic Multimedia","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2010.11","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629485/5634322/05634330.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2010.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Direct Mapping OFDM-Based Transmission Scheme for Underwater Acoustic Multimedia","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634330/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652450","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Mapping OFDM-Based Transmission Scheme for Underwater Acoustic Multimedia","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4190a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076042S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629485","isNumber":"5634322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629485","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5634322","articleId":"5634330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5634358,"authors":[{"name":"Guanhua Tian","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Guanhua","lastName":"Tian","id":"37588703500"},{"name":"Dan Meng","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Meng","id":"37270019100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8095-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4190-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"5634358","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web and internet services","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Robustness","High performance computing","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","Internet","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure rules","node resource provision policy","cloud computing","reboot failures"]}],"abstract":"As a novel computing paradigm, e.g., cloud computing, become popular, researchers proposed various resource sharing techniques and resource provision techniques. However, very limited literatures pay attentions to the reliability of dynamically provided resources. In this paper, we propose a failure rules aware node resource provision policy for heterogeneous services consolidated in cloud computing infrastructure. We evaluate our proposed policy with simulation approach, i.e., implement a simulator of heterogeneous service consolidation platform, which take characteristics of heterogeneous services (both characteristics of resource utility and failure rules), into consideration, and use two production traces to synthesize inputs. The results of evaluation indicate that our proposed resource provision policy is effective for providing robust nodes for heterogeneous services, i.e., our policy can mask more potential node reboot failures from services and leave less chances of unplanned failures, e.g., service failure or node reboot, compared with baseline fault re-provided policy. Meanwhile, our policy involves no negative impact on service performance and no negative impact on node's resource utility, compared with baseline policy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure Rules Based Node Resource Provision Policy for Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2010.69","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629485/5634322/05634358.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2010.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Failure Rules Based Node Resource Provision Policy for Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634358/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652478","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure Rules Based Node Resource Provision Policy for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4190a397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11341S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629485","isNumber":"5634322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629485","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5634322","articleId":"5634358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5634360,"authors":[{"name":"Seungjin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5680555/5634360/5634360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seungjin Lee (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

When the return loss and isolation are better than 15 dB and 20 dB simultaneously, the measured bandwidths of three operating bands are all almost 40 MHz, while the amplitude imbalance is below 0.8 dB and the phase difference is within .","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Tri-Band Branch-Line Coupler With Three Controllable Operating Frequencies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2010.2074191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5634427/05634428.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2010.2074191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634427","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Tri-Band Branch-Line Coupler With Three Controllable Operating Frequencies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5634428/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11674865","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Tri-Band Branch-Line Coupler With Three Controllable Operating Frequencies","sourcePdf":"lmwc-lin-2074191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09805S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5634427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5634427","articleId":"5634428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5634439,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Katsaros","affiliation":["University of Thessally, Greece"],"bio":{"p":["Dimitrios Katsaros (dkatsar@inf.uth.gr) is currently a lecturer at the University of Thessaly, Greece.

The information from the two ECG leads is fused to achieve improved subject identification. The proposed method was tested on three public ECG databases, namely, MIT-BIH Arrhythmias Database, Ml T-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database and Long-Term ST Database, in order to evaluate the proposed subject identification method on normal ECG signals as well as ECG signals with arrhythmias. Excellent rank-1 recognition rates (as high as 99.6%) were achieved based on single heartbeats. The proposed method exhibits good identification accuracies not just with the normal ECG signals, but also in the presence of various arrhythmias.

Assuming the imaging condition is not subject to frequent changes at a particular application site where the face recognition systems are deployed, we propose to do site adaptation for a generic face recognizer based on a small adaptation data set captured at the site. Based on an OSFV face recognizer with Gabor features selected by Adaboost algorithm, we propose several site adaptation methods at the feature level and at the model level. Our experiment results show that the proposed site adaptation approaches can boost the performance of our generic face recognition algorithm based on a small adaptation dataset acquired from the site with a different imaging condition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Site-adaptive face recognition","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634482","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618724/5634461/05634482.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Site-adaptive face recognition","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634482/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652025","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Site-adaptive face recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116193S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618724","isNumber":"5634461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618724","xplore-issue":"5634461","articleId":"5634482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5634496,"authors":[{"name":"Gayathri Mahalingam","affiliation":["Video Image Modeling and Synthesis (VIMS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Gayathri","lastName":"Mahalingam","id":"37596402200"},{"name":"Chandra Kambhamettu","affiliation":["Video Image Modeling and Synthesis (VIMS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Chandra","lastName":"Kambhamettu","id":"37270507500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7582-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7581-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7580-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5634496","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":495},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Face","Aging","Computational modeling","Shape","Training","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic algorithms","face recognition","feature extraction","graph theory","image matching","maximum likelihood estimation","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["age invariant face recognition","graph matching","facial feature points","feature descriptors","maximum a posteriori solution","PCA factorization","deterministic algorithm","FGnet database"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634496","abstract":"In this paper, we present a graph based face representation for efficient age invariant face recognition.

A novel 3D facial surface representation, namely Multi-Scale Local Binary Pattern (MS-LBP) Depth Map, is proposed, which is used along with the Shape Index (SI) Map to increase the distinctiveness of smooth range faces. Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is introduced to extract local features to enhance the robustness to pose variations. Moreover, a hybrid matching is designed for a further improved accuracy. The matching scheme combines local and holistic analysis. The former is achieved by comparing the SIFT-based features extracted from both 3D facial surface representations; while the latter performs a global constraint using facial component and configuration. Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed method does not require time-consuming accurate registration or any additional data in a bootstrap for training special thresholds. The rank-one recognition rate achieved on the complete FRGC v2.0 database is 96.1%. As a result of using local facial features, the approach proves to be competent for dealing with partially occluded face probes as highlighted by supplementary experiments using face masks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face recognition using distinctiveness enhanced facial representations and local feature hybrid matching","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634497","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618724/5634461/05634497.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"3D Face recognition using distinctiveness enhanced facial representations and local feature hybrid matching","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634497/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652059","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face recognition using distinctiveness enhanced facial representations and local feature hybrid matching","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069215S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618724","isNumber":"5634461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618724","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5634461","articleId":"5634497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5634498,"authors":[{"name":"Samarth Bharadwaj","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology, NewDelhi, India"],"firstName":"Samarth","lastName":"Bharadwaj","id":"37531400300"},{"name":"Himanshu S.

The results show promise towards using periocular region for recognition when the information is not sufficient for iris recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periocular biometrics: When iris recognition fails","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634498","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618724/5634461/05634498.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Periocular biometrics: When iris recognition fails","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634498/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652060","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periocular biometrics: When iris recognition fails","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111649S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618724","isNumber":"5634461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618724","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5634461","articleId":"5634498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5634500,"authors":[{"name":"Samarth Bharadwaj","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology, NewDelhi, India"],"firstName":"Samarth","lastName":"Bharadwaj","id":"37531400300"},{"name":"Himanshu S.

In this paper we present a performance evaluation of a local periocular texture based recognition approach. Specifically, the paper investigates the effect of input image quality on recognition performance, the uniqueness of texture between different color channels, and texture information present in different color channels. Recognition results of periocular texture features are compared to those of full face texture features and suggest that periocular texture features are robust to varying image quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of local appearance based periocular recognition","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634536","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618724/5634461/05634536.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of local appearance based periocular recognition","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634536/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of local appearance based periocular recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087552S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618724","isNumber":"5634461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618724","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5634461","articleId":"5634536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5634537,"authors":[{"name":"Jamie R.

The algorithm allows reliable detection of scale space extrema as local feature locations. The scale space contains the mean curvature in each vertex on different smoothed versions of the input mesh. The meshSIFT algorithm then describes the neighbourhood of every scale space extremum in a feature vector consisting of concatenated histograms of shape indices and slant angles. The feature vectors are reliably matched by comparing the angle in feature space. Using RANSAC, the best rigid transformation can be estimated based on the matched features leading to 84% correct pose normalisation of 3D faces from the Bosphorus database. Matches are mostly found between two face surfaces of the same person, allowing the algorithm to be used for 3D face recognition. Simply counting the number of matches allows 93.7% correct identification for face surfaces in the Bosphorus database and 97.7% when only frontal images are considered. In the verification scenario, we obtain an equal error rate of 15.0% to 5.1% (depending on the investigated face surfaces). These results outperform most other algorithms found in literature.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634543","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618724/5634461/05634543.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature detection on 3D face surfaces for pose normalisation and recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634543/","displayDocTitle":"Feature detection on 3D face surfaces for pose normalisation and recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652047","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634543/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature detection on 3D face surfaces for pose normalisation and recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065566S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618724","isNumber":"5634461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618724","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5634461","articleId":"5634543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5634551,"authors":[{"name":"Kunqi Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Kunqi","lastName":"Guo","id":"37606309300"},{"name":"Lixin Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37591933200"},{"name":"Shilou Jia","affiliation":["Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Shilou","lastName":"Jia","id":"38004797100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9003-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9001-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9002-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5634551","dbTime":"86 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Power control","OFDM","Optimization","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","OFDM modulation","radio links","Rayleigh channels","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local link information","data scheduling","OFDMA wireless networks","link time-varying characteristics","Reyleigh fading","co-channel interference","subcarrier allocation","bit loading","constrained joint-layer resource optimization","distributed scheduling algorithm","channel condition","local subcarriers","power control mechanism","subcarrier reuse","global fairness","global power control scheduling algorithm","transmission rate","local links","power allocation","system link protection ratio","analysis accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource optimization","joint-layer","OFDMA","data scheduling","link information"]}],"abstract":"The link time-varying characteristics caused by Reyleigh fading and co-channel interference result in a bottleneck during the process of data scheduling in wireless networks. This paper present an analytical model for formulating the problem of subcarrier allocation and bit loading as a constrained joint-layer resource optimization in OFDMA-based wireless networks. we propose a distributed scheduling algorithm (DSA) which chooses subcarriers randomly based on channel condition of local subcarriers while adopting a power control mechanism to limit co-channel interference for maximizing subcarrier reuse among different links. To achieve better global fairness, depending on DSA, we also present a global power control scheduling algorithm (GPCSA) which can enhance transmission rate over some local links by adjusting power allocation according to the difference between the average C/I of local links and the system link protection ratio. We demonstrate the analysis accuracy and the characteristics improvements both in efficiency and fairness by extensive simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2010.5634551","publicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608544/5634550/05634551.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2010.5634551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local link information based data scheduling in OFDMA wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634551/","displayDocTitle":"Local link information based data scheduling in OFDMA wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649885","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634551/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local link information based data scheduling in OFDMA wireless networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041802S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608544","isNumber":"5634550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608544","xplore-issue":"5634550","articleId":"5634551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5634558,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Recent research on BICM-ID found that LDPC codes with BICM-ID could get better performance than traditional turbo codes.

The simulation results show that efficient power allocation and sub-carrier pairing strategy will greatly reduce the BER.","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2010.5634565","publicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608544/5634550/05634565.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2010.5634565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634550","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation for OFDM relaying systems with bit error ratio formula","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation for OFDM relaying systems with bit error ratio formula","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634565/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649899","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5634565/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation for OFDM relaying systems with bit error ratio formula","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042291S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608544","isNumber":"5634550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608544","xplore-issue":"5634550","articleId":"5634565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5634566,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Xin","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Xin","id":"38272673300"},{"name":"Song Ke-ping","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Ke-ping","id":"38277841100"},{"name":"Wang Zhi-xin","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Zhi-xin","id":"38271205000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9003-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9001-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9002-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5634566","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Routing","Filtering","Matrix decomposition","Resource management","MIMO","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay signaling schemes","routing schemes","MIMO-relay network","MIMO-relay technology","cell edge performance","4G wireless system","relay filtering","signaling method","multiple antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-Relay","channel decomposition","relay filtering","relay signaling","relay power allocation","routing"]}],"abstract":"MIMO-relay technology is accepted as a promising solution to improve cell edge performance for the future 4G wireless system.

In the paper, a relay filtering method is first studied to decompose the complex channel of `multiple sources'-`multiple relays'-`multiple destinations' into several independent channels of `single source'-`single relay'-`single destination'; then the relay signaling method is discussed to optimize the capacity of each decomposed channel, and the relay power allocation scheme among different decomposed channels is further analyzed; at last different routing schemes are compared in the relay network, and an optimal routing scheme with large signaling overhead and several suboptimal routing schemes with less signaling overhead are proposed.

technologies are focused on delivering higher levels of throughput through the use of Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) technology. MIMO systems use multiple transmit and receive data paths to provide significant increases in data throughput by exploiting the characteristics of the radio channel. Thus, MIMO system performance is directly related to the propagation environment in which the device is operating. Full system test with all components in place, including the antennas, is critical to performance testing of MIMO transmissions. This paper will explore a new solution for over-the-air MIMO testing that combines a channel emulator with a reverberation chamber to achieve MIMO throughput performance testing and enable an accurate wireless device performance prediction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilizing a channel emulator with a reverberation chamber to create the optimal MIMO OTA test methodology","publicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2010.5634577","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608544/5634550/05634577.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2010.5634577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Utilizing a channel emulator with a reverberation chamber to create the optimal MIMO OTA test methodology","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634577/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649911","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilizing a channel emulator with a reverberation chamber to create the optimal MIMO OTA test methodology","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030281S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608544","isNumber":"5634550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608544","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5634550","articleId":"5634577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5634578,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Li","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Li","id":"37597745900"},{"name":"Qin Hao","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Hao","id":"37596328400"},{"name":"Sun Xianpu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Xianpu","id":"37596441100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9003-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9001-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9002-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5634578","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","OFDM","Adaptive filters","Least squares approximation","Frequency domain analysis","Convergence","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive combining scheme","MB-OFDM UWB systems","constrained least-mean-square algorithm","LMS algorithm","band orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","ultrawideband systems","minimum mean-square-error combining","MMSE","channel state information","adaptive filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Combining","Constrained LMS algorithm","MB-OFDM","Ultra-wideband"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive combining scheme based on a constrained least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm is proposed for multi-band orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) systems. The minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) combining is achieved adaptively at the cost of using a small amount of training symbols. Moreover, the channel state information (CSI), which is usually employed in conventional schemes, can be obtained from the set of converged weights in our scheme. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is that, in all cases, the convergence behavior is only governed by the step size normalized by the input power to the adaptive filter, not influenced by input signal correlation matrix. Analytical expressions are derived for the constraints and some parameters of the algorithm. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and correctness of the derived expressions.","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2010.5634578","publicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608544/5634550/05634578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2010.5634578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634550","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive combining in MB-OFDM UWB systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive combining in MB-OFDM UWB systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634578/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649912","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5634578/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive combining in MB-OFDM UWB systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041771S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608544","isNumber":"5634550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608544","xplore-issue":"5634550","articleId":"5634578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5634579,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Chun-guo","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Blind Signals Processing, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Chun-guo","id":"38270955500"},{"name":"Li Li-zhong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Blind Signals Processing, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li-zhong","id":"38273745700"},{"name":"Zhang Xiao-yong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Blind Signals Processing, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Xiao-yong","id":"38275047000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9003-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9001-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9002-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5634579","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Correlation","Estimation","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust frequency offset estimation scheme","OFDM systems","estimation metric","wireless channel","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Integer Frequency Offset (IFO)","Timing Offset","Correlation Sequence"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an improved carrier frequency offset estimation method which is less sensitive to timing offset is proposed.

The research of spectrum sensing has caused widely concerned, especially the sample energy detection model is widely used. To guarantee the precision of detection, most of detect mechanisms used joint mechanism, but most of them have redundant problem. This article proposes key nodes based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio, with the guarantee of precision to solve the redundancy problem. In our model, the detect nodes have been distinguished; only key nodes of good capacity are selected for information fusion. Due to the effect of environment those key nodes have better capacity, and they are select by our designed time window mechanism (TWM). The simulation result has indicated our model can solve the redundancy problem with the guarantee of precision.","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2010.5634587","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608544/5634550/05634587.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2010.5634587","publicationTitle":"2010 Global Mobile Congress","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Key nodes based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Key nodes based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634587/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634587/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11649921","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key nodes based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04475S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608544","isNumber":"5634550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608544","xplore-issue":"5634550","articleId":"5634587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5634592,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-feng Lu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei-feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37536999700"},{"name":"Meng Wu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37403027500"},{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37535218300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9003-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9001-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9002-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5634592","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Computer architecture","Downlink","Microprocessors","Bit rate","Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","Markov processes","numerical analysis","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-hop-relay WCDMA cellular Systems","congestion control","multidimensional Markov chains","average downlink transmission rate","call blocking probability","numerical calculation","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["two-hop-relay","WCDMA","congestion control","Markov chain modeling"]}],"abstract":"This article firstly introduces a new architecture of two-hop-relay WCDMA cellular system with congestion control, and builds the analytical model of this system via multidimensional Markov chains.

For the rotated QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), it unveils the optimum rotation matrix depends on the modulation order, code rate and iteration number. This new scheme can take full advantage of the modulation diversity of rotated QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), the frequency diversity of OFDM system and the coding-gain of Turbo codes all together. Actually, it extends the original uncoded modulation diversity over an independent Rayleigh fading channel to a joint coding and modulation diversity over time/frequency selective fading channels.

Recently the improvement to compressed sampling for multiband signal ignites the excitement of the researchers again. The main focus of analog CS approach is on the Fourier transform model the multiband signal can be reliably reconstructed from sub-Nyquist sampled data. Extending the idea of analog CS, the novel formwork of this paper is based on the Fourier sampling. In order to apply discrete frequency spectra to bandpass sampling, we introduce an exponent demodulation function to the traditional bandpass sampling formwork.

This frequency offset results in inter-carrier interference (ICI) and.

A dynamic sub-carrier allocation algorithm (DSAA) is proposed in order to obtain the maximization of the total scheduling utility based on the optimization model and the maximization utility theory. It is shown that by combining DSAA with time scale interference predictor (TSIP) which at large time scales predict ON / OFF period of user data with temporal correlation structure across multiple time scales in multi-user interference environment, efficiency is improved further.

We investigate equalization over buried fibers having CD up to 3200ps/nm, PMD up to 45ps.

Observed from the network layer and transport layer, these attacks may not contain significant malicious activities, and generate abnormal network traffic. However, traditional security techniques usually detect attacks from those two layers. Although some security techniques can detect some application layer attacks, these techniques can only detect some known attacks, and these techniques can't detect the unknown or novel attacks happened on application layer. In theory, application layer anomaly detection can detect the unknown and novel attacks happened on application layer, so the research of application layer anomaly detection is very important. This paper presents a new application layer anomaly detection method which based on HSMM. The experimental results show that this method has high detection accuracy and low false positive ratio.","doi":"10.1109/IFITA.2010.145","publicationTitle":"2010 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5633132/5634735/05634757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFITA.2010.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634735","startPage":"411","endPage":"414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application Layer Anomaly Detection Based on HSMM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application Layer Anomaly Detection Based on HSMM","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634757/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11648630","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5634757/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application Layer Anomaly Detection Based on HSMM","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"4115b411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051876S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5633132","isNumber":"5634735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5633132","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5634735","articleId":"5634757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5634768,"authors":[{"name":"Ted H.

A mathematical optimization problem for coloring the active wireless edges in a time-division scheduling frame is formulated. The optimization eliminates primary conflicts and minimizes secondary conflicts. The active wireless edges are specified in an integer zero-one 'edge-specification' matrix. An 'edge-interference' matrix is formulated, where each element represents the interference power if two edges share a color. The objective of the optimization problem is to partition the integer edge-specification matrix into a sum of C integer zero-one matrices which specify the active edges assigned to each of the C colors, such that the secondary interference is minimized. The optimal solution requires a constrained partitioning of an integer matrix, which is a combinatorial problem. A polynomial time approximation algorithm called Least-Noise coloring is presented. Simulations of an essentially saturated hexagonal mesh network supporting backhaul traffic flows are reported. It is confirmed that interference and edge transmission powers can be minimized, and that the mesh network can be configured to achieve near-perfect Quality of Service guarantees with essentially 100% throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2010.67","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629486/5634631/05634768.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2010.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634631","startPage":"348","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference and Power Minimization in TDMA-OFDMA Infrastructure Wireless Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference and Power Minimization in TDMA-OFDMA Infrastructure Wireless Mesh Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634768/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11651292","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5634768/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference and Power Minimization in TDMA-OFDMA Infrastructure Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"4145a348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056979S","chronDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629486","isNumber":"5634631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629486","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5634631","articleId":"5634768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5634781,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Orosz","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Orosz","id":"37596453300"},{"name":"Tamas Skopko","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"Tamas","lastName":"Skopko","id":"37596453400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7789-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4145-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-9019"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-9027"}],"articleNumber":"5634781","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":692},"abstract":"Widely used network measurement applications, such as tcpdump and Wireshark, use the same common libpcap packet capture library. Libpcap assigns a 10-6 second precision timestamp to all processed frames. Higher physical bandwidth implies shorter inter-arrival times between consecutive frames. Therefore timestamp precision must be proportional to the link speed. Latest version 1.0.x of libpcap provides 10-6 second native resolution, however pcap format supports a larger 2 x 32-bit timestamp value for each stored packets. On Gigabit Ethernet or faster networks, timestamp resolution that works in the microsecond domain may not enable us to precisely reproduce the time-domain relation between consecutive frames. Therefore overall analysis of the data transmission could drive to a false result. Independently from one other, five impact factors could directly bias the generation of timestamps: hardware architecture, NIC driver operation mode, clock source, kernel queue handler and the libpcap itself. In an idealized case generated timestamps are always converging and suitably close to the real arrival or transmission time of each frames so to conserve the original inter-arrival time values. For packet capturing with libpcap, it is assumed that timestamping performed when a frame is enqueued to the kernel's input packet queue. Accordingly these timestamps represents the time moment when a frame reaches the input queue. Libpcap must retrieve these timestamps from the kernel. Timestamp resolution of network measurement applications must be increased according to the requirements of advanced high speed data networks. In our paper we are going to show an alternative libpcap-based solution that features nanosecond precision timestamping.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Linux","Clocks","Delay","Ethernet networks","Driver circuits","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux","local area networks","network analysers","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high precision timestamping","Linux","libpcap packet capture library","gigabit Ethernet","software-based packet capturing","data transmission","timestamp resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["libpcap","timestamp resolution","inter-arrival time","linux kernel","high speed network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2010.65","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629486/5634631/05634781.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2010.65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-Based Packet Capturing with High Precision Timestamping for Linux","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Software-Based Packet Capturing with High Precision Timestamping for Linux","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634781/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634781/","accessionNumber":"11651299","conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software-Based Packet Capturing with High Precision Timestamping for Linux","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"4145a381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054799S","chronDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629486","isNumber":"5634631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629486","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5634631","articleId":"5634781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5634871,"authors":[{"name":"Albashir Adel Mohamed","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Albashir Adel","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"38274527700"},{"name":"Maha Mohamed Elsabrouty","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Maha Mohamed","lastName":"Elsabrouty","id":"37297463000"},{"name":"Salwa Hussien El-Ramly","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Salwa Hussien","lastName":"El-Ramly","id":"38185371600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7789-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4145-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-9019"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-9027"}],"articleNumber":"5634871","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Reliability","Decoding","Iterative decoding","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","parity check codes","reliability","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrapped iterative decoding algorithms","low density parity check codes","reliability ratio based weighted bit-flipping algorithm","processing time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-flipping algorithm","low density parity check (LDPC) codes","Modified weighted bit-flipping","reliability ratio based weighted bit-flipping"]}],"abstract":"Reliability ratio based weighted bit-flipping algorithm is one of the best hard decision decoding algorithms in performance.

Multiple bit upsets (MBUs) induced by a single event in adjacent memory cells gets significantly increased. This paper proposes the efficient two-dimensional error codes to mitigate radiation-induced MBUs in memory. This scheme can correct MBUs with any possible width and assure the reliability of memory with very low cost overhead. Firstly, each word is transformed to a matrix form. Then, low complexity multibit error detection codes are applied in each row for error detection while parity codes are applied in each column for error correction. Furthermore, the layout architecture of two-dimensional error codes is used to mitigate MBUs in the redundancy bits. The proposed scheme has been implemented in Verilog and validated through a wide set of simulations. The experiment results reveal that the proposed method has a superior protection level. Compared with the existing multibit error correction codes, it has lower encoding and decoding overheads, even for Hamming codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652551","htmlLink":"/document/5634874/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Two-Dimensional Error Codes for Multiple Bit Upsets Mitigation in Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Two-Dimensional Error Codes for Multiple Bit Upsets Mitigation in Memory","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"4243a129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096136S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629473","isNumber":"5634869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629473","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5634869","articleId":"5634874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5634879,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Lung Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Shoufeng, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Lung","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37290471700"},{"name":"Chen-Wei Lan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Shoufeng, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Wei","lastName":"Lan","id":"37588827800"},{"name":"Yu-Chih Lo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Shoufeng, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chih","lastName":"Lo","id":"37589110500"},{"name":"Yu-Sheng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Shoufeng, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Sheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37291625700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8447-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"5634879","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Noise","Noise reduction","CMOS image sensors","Image quality","Filtering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","CMOS image sensors","image denoising","median filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive de-noising filter algorithm","CMOS image sensor testing","median filter technique","adaptive detection windows","pixel defect de-noising","peak signal-to-noise ratio","image quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","adaptive de-nosing filter algorithm","PSNR","image quality"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an adaptive de-nosing filter (ADF) algorithm to effectively remove the image defects for the CMOS image sensor testing applications.

Anomaly detection is often the primary means of providing early indication of faults and defects. This paper presents a probabilistic method, which employs the probability of data events to evaluate the behavior of system. In order to measure the probability of events in the system, sampling of two events with distinct distance is done. Consequently, during test stage, the probability of events can be measured. An anomaly exists in test data provided that this probability does not reach a predefined threshold. The experiments on 112 standard benchmarks show that the proposed method can detect 100% of anomalies. Also, the area overhead of the proposed detector grows linearly, while the area overhead of other typical detectors grows exponentially by the increase in one of the detector's parameters.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2010.25","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629473/5634869/05634883.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2010.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Method to Detect Anomalies in Embedded Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634883/","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Method to Detect Anomalies in Embedded Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652556","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634883/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Method to Detect Anomalies in Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"4243a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060453S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629473","isNumber":"5634869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629473","xplore-issue":"5634869","articleId":"5634883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5634890,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This paper introduces a new switch box architecture to mitigate soft errors. In this switch box architecture, the number of SRAM bits required for programming the switch boxes is reduced by means of switch reduction with slight impact on routing capability of the switch box. This architecture does not require any modification of the existing placement and routing algorithms. The proposed architecture was evaluated on several MCNC benchmarks using VPR tool. The experimental results show that this architecture decreases the susceptibility of switch boxes to single event upsets by about 18% on average compared to the traditional ones. Also, our architecture decreases the probability of ridging and short faults in the switch boxes by about 32% on average.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2010.33","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629473/5634869/05634899.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2010.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Switch Box Architecture to Mitigate Bridging and Short Faults in SRAM-Based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5634899/","displayDocTitle":"A Switch Box Architecture to Mitigate Bridging and Short Faults in SRAM-Based FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5634899/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11652564","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Switch Box Architecture to Mitigate Bridging and Short Faults in SRAM-Based FPGAs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"4243a218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07151S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629473","isNumber":"5634869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629473","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5634869","articleId":"5634899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5634927,"authors":[{"name":"Lizhen Yu","affiliation":["Department of Creative Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Lizhen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37593893900"},{"name":"Jeffrey Hung","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Hung","id":"37606177500"},{"name":"Boryau Sheu","affiliation":["Sigma Designs, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Boryau","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37603902200"},{"name":"Bill Huynh","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Huynh","id":"37602027600"},{"name":"Loc Nguyen","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Loc","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37594972600"},{"name":"Shianling Wu","affiliation":["Department of Creative Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shianling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407115600"},{"name":"Laung-Terng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Creative Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Laung-Terng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406756400"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Wen","affiliation":["Department of Creative Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Wen","id":"37416148800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8447-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"5634927","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5634927","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Algorithm design and analysis","Random access memory","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Circuit faults","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","multiport networks","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self-test architecture","multiport static RAM","hybrid BIST approach","multiport memory testing","debugging defect","programmable portion algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid build-in self-test","programmable portion algorithm","hard-wired portion algorithm","inter-port defects","multi-port static RAMs"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid built-in self-test (BIST) approach for multi-port memory testing, featuring an algorithm with both a programmable portion and a hard-wired portion.

The results of repeated experiment show that the method can effectively solve the previous problem and it is a practical and effective clustering algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IFITA.2010.186","pdfPath":"/iel5/5633132/5634627/05635035.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"33","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","publicationTitle":"2010 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFITA.2010.186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K-means Multiple Clustering Research Based on Pseudo Parallel Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"K-means Multiple Clustering Research Based on Pseudo Parallel Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11648403","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5635035/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K-means Multiple Clustering Research Based on Pseudo Parallel Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"4115a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107931S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5633132","isNumber":"5634627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5633132","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5634627","articleId":"5635035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5635063,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Liming","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Liming","id":"38468429700"},{"name":"Huang Yongqing","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Yongqing","id":"37294313900"},{"name":"Zhang Yangan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yangan","id":"37586919700"},{"name":"Wang Gai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Gai","id":"37587797100"},{"name":"Zhang Minglun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Minglun","id":"37586918900"},{"name":"Zhang Jinnan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jinnan","id":"37586915600"},{"name":"Yuan Xueguang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xueguang","id":"37586917200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7622-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7621-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635063","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Optical transmitters","Adders","High speed optical techniques","Equations","Mathematical model","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","precoding","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel prefix network","DQPSK precoder","high-speed optical transmission","differential quadrature phase-shift keying","ML523","frequency 866.551 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel prefix network (PPN)","differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK)","DQPSK precoder","Kogge Stone (KS)","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduced the principle of parallel prefix network (PPN) and proved the feasibility of applying PPN to differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) precoder.

In this paper, we present our experience in applying different distributed architectures to parallelize a genetic algorithm used to solve the concept identification problem. We developed an approach to identify concepts in execution traces by finding cohesive and decoupled fragments of the traces. The approach relies on a genetic algorithm, on a textual analysis of source code using latent semantic indexing, and on trace compression techniques. The fitness function in our approach has a polynomial evaluation cost and is highly computationally intensive. A run of our approach on a trace of thousand methods may require several hours of computation on a standard PC. Consequently, we reduced computation time by parallelizing the genetic algorithm at the core of our approach over a standard TCP/IP network. We developed four distributed architectures and compared their performances: we observed a decrease of computation time up to 140 times. Although presented in the context of concept location, our findings could be applied to many other search-based software engineering problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635157/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11641842","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635157/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Concept Location with Genetic Algorithms: A Comparison of Four Distributed Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concept Location with Genetic Algorithms: A Comparison of Four Distributed Architectures","confLoc":"Benevento, Italy","sourcePdf":"4195a153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111519S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5633360","isNumber":"5634812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5633360","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5634812","articleId":"5635157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5635185,"authors":[{"name":"Todd Kulesza","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Kulesza","id":"37320951500"},{"name":"Simone Stumpf","affiliation":["City University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Stumpf","id":"37267329800"},{"name":"Margaret Burnett","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Margaret","lastName":"Burnett","id":"37282614000"},{"name":"Weng-Keen Wong","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Weng-Keen","lastName":"Wong","id":"37597866200"},{"name":"Yann Riche","affiliation":["Riche Design, Australia"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Riche","id":"37586915800"},{"name":"Travis Moore","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Travis","lastName":"Moore","id":"37595945700"},{"name":"Ian Oberst","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Oberst","id":"37586915100"},{"name":"Amber Shinsel","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Amber","lastName":"Shinsel","id":"37586922300"},{"name":"Kevin McIntosh","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"McIntosh","id":"37586299400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8485-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-6106"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-6092"}],"articleNumber":"5635185","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":569},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High definition video","Channel hot electron injection","Gallium nitride","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","program debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["explanatory debugging","end-user debugging","machine-learning algorithms","task-oriented desktop organizers","handwriting recognizers","natural programming methodology","text-classification program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["end-user debugging","HCI","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635185","doi":"10.1109/VLHCC.2010.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2010.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635184","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5633131/5635184/05635185.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explanatory Debugging: Supporting End-User Debugging of Machine-Learned Programs","abstract":"Many machine-learning algorithms learn rules of behavior from individual end users, such as task-oriented desktop organizers and handwriting recognizers.

This channel estimation is used to handle rapid variations of channel within a transmission block. With the estimate of the channel matrix for the Alamouti symbol interval, a zero-forcing (ZF) receiver can be applied to detect this symbol. Linear and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) decoding algorithms are also introduced in this paper. These receivers take into consideration the variation of channel over two consecutive OFDM symbols, i.e., over Alamouti symbol. The performance of this estimator is compared with Least Square (LS) channel estimator via simulation. Moreover it is shown that using MMSE as a decoding algorithm provides better performance than conventional, linear or ZF decoding methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2010.56","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629486/5634631/05635272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2010.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634631","startPage":"312","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for Alamouti Coded OFDM over Time Variant Channel with Different Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for Alamouti Coded OFDM over Time Variant Channel with Different Receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635272/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11651278","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5635272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for Alamouti Coded OFDM over Time Variant Channel with Different Receivers","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"4145a312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062445S","chronDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629486","isNumber":"5634631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629486","xplore-issue":"5634631","articleId":"5635272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5635275,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["Fujitsu Research and Development Center Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601117200"},{"name":"Hua Zhou","affiliation":["Fujitsu Research and Development Center Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37598486900"},{"name":"Jianming Wu","affiliation":["Fujitsu Research and Development Center Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37537236100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7789-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4145-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-9019"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-9027"}],"articleNumber":"5635275","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","mean square error methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reference signals power allocation","uplink MU-MIMO","LTE system","virtual subcarriers","uniformly placed reference signal","cyclic shift","mean square error estimation","least square estimation","gain 2 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reference signal","Channel estimation","MUMIMO","LTE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an efficient power allocation scheme of reference signals (RS) for uplink MU-MIMO in LTE system is introduced. In LTE system, some virtual subcarriers at the borders of the allocated bandwidth are used which invalidates the conventional power allocation schemes for uniformly placed reference signal. Further, RS for multiuser are multiplexed by cyclic shift. Constant power is required within one step of cyclic shift which adds more constraint on power allocation. The proposed RS power allocation scheme minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the least square (LS) estimates considering the effect of virtual subcarriers and the constraint due to the cyclic shift. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results, showing that 2 dB SNR gain is achieved as opposed to conventional scheme with equal power reference signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2010.55","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629486/5634631/05635275.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2010.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reference Signals Power Allocation for Uplink MU-MIMO in LTE System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635275/","displayDocTitle":"Reference Signals Power Allocation for Uplink MU-MIMO in LTE System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11651279","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635275/","conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference Signals Power Allocation for Uplink MU-MIMO in LTE System","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"4145a307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046721S","chronDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629486","isNumber":"5634631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629486","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5634631","articleId":"5635275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5635304,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The practicability and technical limits associated with the IE4-class efficiency levels are addressed, taking into account technical and economical limitations.

It is shown that the BPL (PL) algorithm always offers the best (worst) transmission performance. The absolute transmission capacity differences between these algorithms are independent of signal bit rate and increase with both transmission distance and digital-to-analog converter/analog-to-digital converter (DAC/ADC) sampling rate. More importantly, numerical results also indicate that, for both worst-case and normal-case MMF links of less than 300 m, in comparison with the most sophisticated BPL algorithm, the simplest PL algorithm is sufficiently effective in escalating the OOFDM MMF system performance to its maximum potential. The effectiveness of the PL algorithm can be further improved when a large number of subcarriers are utilized. On the other hand, for relatively long MMF links (> 800 m) with their 3-dB bandwidths being much less than the transmitted OOFDM signal spectrum, the BPL algorithm has to be adopted. The aforementioned results have great potential for practical cost-effective OOFDM transceiver architecture design.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2010.2092422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563994/5584914/05635310.pdf","startPage":"1051","endPage":"1059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2010.2092422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Performance Comparisons of Optical OFDM Adaptive Loading Algorithms in Multimode Fiber-Based Transmission Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Performance Comparisons of Optical OFDM Adaptive Loading Algorithms in Multimode Fiber-Based Transmission Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635310/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11675069","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635310/","volume":"2","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Statistical Performance Comparisons of Optical OFDM Adaptive Loading Algorithms in Multimode Fiber-Based Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"jphot-tang-2092422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050878S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"5584914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5584914","articleId":"5635310","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5635318,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Seyfi","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Seyfi","id":"37397534400"},{"name":"Sami Muhaidat","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Muhaidat","id":"37393377900"},{"name":"Jie Liang","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Liang","id":"37337013500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5635318","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1295},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the effect of feedback delay and channel estimation errors in a decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative network with relay selection.

The Ambrosio-Tortorelli and Shah elliptic approximations are defined to work in a small local neighborhood, which are sufficient to denoise smooth regions with sharp boundaries. However, texture is nonlocal in nature and requires semilocal/non-local information for efficient image denoising and restoration. Inspired from recent works (nonlocal means of Buades, Coll, Morel, and nonlocal total variation of Gilboa, Osher), we extend the local Ambrosio-Tortorelli and Shah approximations to MS functional (MS) to novel nonlocal formulations, for better restoration of fine structures and texture. We present several applications of the proposed nonlocal MS regularizers in image processing such as color image denoising, color image deblurring in the presence of Gaussian or impulse noise, color image inpainting, color image super-resolution, and color filter array demosaicing. In all the applications, the proposed nonlocal regularizers produce superior results over the local ones, especially in image inpainting with large missing regions. We also prove several characterizations of minimizers based upon dual norm formulations.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2092433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5767712/05635336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2092433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767712","startPage":"1583","endPage":"1598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlocal Mumford-Shah Regularizers for Color Image Restoration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlocal Mumford-Shah Regularizers for Color Image Restoration","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12006326","pubMedId":"21078579","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5635336/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlocal Mumford-Shah Regularizers for Color Image Restoration","sourcePdf":"tip-vese-2092433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162646S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5767712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5767712","articleId":"5635336","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5635337,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5750157/5635337/5635337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhou Wang (S'97\u2013A'01\u2013M'02) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2001.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada.

While significant progress has been made in measuring local image quality/distortion, the pooling stage is often done in ad-hoc ways, lacking theoretical principles and reliable computational models. This paper aims to test the hypothesis that when viewing natural images, the optimal perceptual weights for pooling should be proportional to local information content, which can be estimated in units of bit using advanced statistical models of natural images. Our extensive studies based upon six publicly-available subject-rated image databases concluded with three useful findings. First, information content weighting leads to consistent improvement in the performance of IQA algorithms. Second, surprisingly, with information content weighting, even the widely criticized peak signal-to-noise-ratio can be converted to a competitive perceptual quality measure when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Cross section of ITCs is rectangular or negligible. This paper presents analytical equations of mutual inductance of two ITCs applicable to tokamak reactors using the filament method. These equations are based on those formulated by Neumann. The numerical analysis of the integrations resulting from these equations is solved using the extended three-point Gaussian algorithm. The finite element method (FEM) is employed to verify the mutual inductance equations of ITCs. The results obtained using FEM, when dimensional parameters of ITCs are changed, confirm the analytical and empirical results showing an error of less than 0.2043% in the worst case. This indicates the reliability of the presented equations. This paper also employs FEM to obtain depth of penetration of electromagnetic waves in high-conductivity conductors (HCCs). The results show that the ratio of real depth of penetration, obtained by FEM, to ideal depth of penetration in HCCs is independent of frequency.

We derive analytical expressions for the common-mode gain frequency response due to random mismatches (transconductance, drain-source conductance and parasitic capacitance) and verify the integrity of the analysis through simulation. To address the systematic mismatch in the drain capacitance of the input pair transistors, we employ capacitive neutralization and verify its effectiveness in practice from the fabricated IA chip samples in a 0.35- CMOS process technology. The measured average common-mode gain improvement for the 20 fabricated samples employing our neutralization technique is about 20 dB at 2 MHz ( 3 dB bandwidth). When taking into account the differential gain response (33.7 dB), the average CMRR of the neutralized IA at 2 MHz exceeds 90 dB. The IA occupies an area of 0.068 and dissipates 0.85 mW from a 3-V power supply.

Any RF input signal can be applied to excite the circuit under examination because only dissipated power levels are measured, which makes this approach attractive for online thermal monitoring and built-in test scenarios. A fully differential sensor topology is introduced that has been specifically designed for the proposed method by constructing it with a wide dynamic range, programmable sensitivity to dc, and RF power dissipation, as well as compatibility with CMOS technology. This paper also presents an outline of a procedure to model the local electrothermal coupling between heat sources and the sensor, which is used to define the temperature sensor's specifications as well as to predict the thermal signature of the circuit under test. A prototype chip with an RF amplifier and temperature sensor was fabricated in a conventional 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology. The proposed concepts were validated by correlating RF measurements at 1 GHz with the measured dc voltage output of the on-chip sensor and the simulation results, demonstrating that the RF power dissipation can be monitored and the 1-dB compression point can be estimated with less than 1-dB error.

First, for an accurate analysis and comparison, new current waveform models are identified, and a realistic approach incorporated using a nonzero knee voltage and voltage-dependent nonlinear capacitance is employed to derive the voltage waveforms of the amplifiers. An analysis is performed to show the efficiency, output power, power gain, and output power compression points for both modes. Using this knowledge, along with a complete performance comparison, we provide a direction for optimizing the amplifier design. The analytic results are further verified based on the measured results of 3.54-GHz Class-F and Class- amplifiers using a commercial 60-W peak-to-envelope power gallium-nitride device. The experimental results show that Class-F and Class- amplifiers operate at drain efficiencies of 69.9% and 69.4% at saturated output powers of 47.4 and 47.2 dBm, respectively. These remarkably similar performances have excellent agreement with the predicted analysis at our operational frequency.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2090167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5685336/05635372.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2090167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"153","endPage":"165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Design Methodology of High-Efficiency Class-F and Class-- Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Design Methodology of High-Efficiency Class-F and Class-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\hbox{F}}^{{\\hbox{-}1}}$</tex></formula> Power Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635372/","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5635372/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11733598","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Design Methodology of High-Efficiency Class-F and Class-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\hbox{F}}^{{\\hbox{-}1}}$</tex></formula> Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2090167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118108S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5685336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5685336","articleId":"5635372","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5635374,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Meghdadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662237/5635374/5635374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masoud Meghdadi received the B.Sc. degree from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007, both in electrical engineering.

Indeed, in this paper, we demonstrate that, if the alternative polar representation is considered, the resulting Volterra series model is much more adequate to model the physical behavior of PA devices. This is the feature that supports the design of an innovative PA model, denominated the Polar Volterra model, which is more flexible and general than the traditional Volterra series commonly used in PA baseband modeling. The closeness of the new model formulation with the PA physical operation enabled, for the first time in PA low-pass equivalent behavioral modeling, the theoretical derivation of a Volterra series model directly from the PA circuit analysis. In fact, as the proposed model directly isolates such PA physical characteristics, a significant reduction of the number of model coefficients is achieved when compared with the traditional Cartesian Volterra model. Finally, validation results that highlight the advantages of the Polar Volterra model are presented. These were based on the laboratory measurements performed on two PAs with distinct architectures: a conventional class-AB amplifier and a polar transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2087347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2087347","startPage":"4012","endPage":"4021","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5662240/05635375.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation and Physical Interpretation of the Power-Amplifier Polar Volterra Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Validation and Physical Interpretation of the Power-Amplifier Polar Volterra Model","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","volume":"58","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635375/","accessionNumber":"11692704","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635375/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation and Physical Interpretation of the Power-Amplifier Polar Volterra Model","sourcePdf":"tmtt-cunha-2087347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075038S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5662240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5662240","articleId":"5635375","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5635377,"authors":[{"name":"Mathieu Leconte","affiliation":["INRIA-Technicolor, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5875977/5635377/5635377-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mathieu Leconte graduated from Supelec, Paris, France, in 2008.

However, more sensing cooperations for a channel may decrease the transmission time of the secondary users, or lose opportunities for exploiting other channels. In this paper, we study this tradeoff by using the theory of oartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This formulation leads to an optimal sensing scheduling policy that determines which secondary users sense which channels with what miss detection probability and false alarm probability. A myopic policy with lower complexity yet comparable performance is also proposed. We further analytically study the properties and the solution structure for the myopic and the optimal policies under a simplified system model. Theoretical results reveal that under certain conditions, some simple but robust structures of the value function exist, which lead to an easy way to obtain the solution of POMDP. Moreover, the cooperative sensing scheduling problem embedded in our POMDP, which is generally a hard combinatorial problem, can be analyzed in an efficient way. Numerical and simulation results are provided to illustrate that our design can utilize the spectrum more efficiently for CR users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2010.2083250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635427","startPage":"535","endPage":"549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5635427/05635428.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Scheduling of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5635428/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Scheduling of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11656157","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Scheduling of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-zhang-2083250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103546S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5635427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5635427","articleId":"5635428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5635429,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/5635427/5635429/5635429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Shi (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering in 2008 from the University of California, Davis, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include energy-efficient networking based on user behaviors, long-reach passive optical network (LR-PON), NG broadband access network architectures and protocols, and various other networking topics.

LR-PON extends the coverage span of PONs from the traditional 20 km range to 100 km and consolidates the multiple optical line terminals (OLTs) and central offices, thus reducing the operational cost and serving many more users. There are two type of LR-PONs: \u201ctree-and-branch\u201d and \u201cring-and-spur\u201d LR-PON. To \u201cgreen\u201d the LR-PON and make it energy-efficient, we study a network planning approach based on user behaviors. By considering the different network usage behaviors of different kind of users (i.e., daily bandwidth demand profiles), we can assign users (e.g., business and residential users) efficiently to different wavelengths in \u201ctree-and-branch\u201d or \u201cring-and-spur\u201d LR-PONs at networking planning stage and achieve high network utilization at all times. Heuristic searches can provide such assignments and their approximate solutions are very close to the lower bound. The behavior-aware user assignment achieves significant improvement over the traditional method in terms of used wavelengths and could thus saves the energy consumed by the LR-PON.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2010.2083210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635427","startPage":"449","endPage":"457","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5635427/05635429.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2010.2083210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Long-Reach Passive Optical Network: A Network Planning Approach Based on User Behaviors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Passive optical networks","Telecommunication network management","Behavioral science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","optical fibre networks","optical fibre subscriber loops","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient long-reach passive optical network","network planning","user behaviors","optical line terminals","broadband access spanning","LR-PON","network utilization","behavior-aware user assignment","broadband access network","last-mile network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access network","long-reach passive optical network","network planning","user behaviors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Long-Reach Passive Optical Network: A Network Planning Approach Based on User Behaviors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5635429/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11656163","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Long-Reach Passive Optical Network: A Network Planning Approach Based on User Behaviors","sourcePdf":"jsyst-shi-2083210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193754S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5635427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5635427","articleId":"5635429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5635432,"authors":[{"name":"Yinggang Du","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/5635427/5635432/5635432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yinggang Du (S'02\u2013M'04) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectivley and the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2004.","From 2004 to 2005, he was with the UTStarcom Shenzhen R&D Center.

Such a scenario may arise in many practical contexts, including cellular applications and wireless transmissions over unlicensed frequency bands. It is known that conventional BICM decoding strategies suffer from significant performance degradation when the received signal is plagued by NBI. To overcome this difficulty, in the present work we model the interference power on each subcarrier as a nuisance parameter which is averaged out from the likelihood function. This approach results into a novel bit-metric that makes use of a suitable estimate of the NBI power obtained from previous data decisions. Numerical simulations indicate that the error rate performance of the proposed scheme is close to that of a maximum likelihood (ML) Viterbi decoder having perfect knowledge of the NBI power across the signal spectrum.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.110510.091535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05635474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.110510.091535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","startPage":"20","endPage":"26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Decoding of BICM-OFDM Transmissions Plagued by Narrowband Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Decoding of BICM-OFDM Transmissions Plagued by Narrowband Interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635474/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742908","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5635474/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Decoding of BICM-OFDM Transmissions Plagued by Narrowband Interference","sourcePdf":"020-tw1101-morelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060639S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5635474","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5635475,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Yang","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5635475/5635475-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Yang received the B.Sc. degree (EE) from Peking University in 2007 and the M.A.Sc. degree from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada in 2010.

The technique enables the relaying nodes to maintain constant envelope signaling without the need to perform decoding and signal re-modulation. The bit-error-probability (BEP) of this PF technique, in conjunction with constant envelope CPFSK modulation in a time-selective Rayleigh fading environment and discriminator detection, was analyzed. Both cases of with and without antenna selection at the relay were considered. In the former case, a clever phase-adjustment scheme that allows the relay to maintain phase continuity was proposed. Our results indicate that without antenna selection, PF has a lower BEP than decode-and-forward (DF). It also delivers the same performance as amplify-and-forward (AF) when fading is quasi-static. In a time-selective fading environment, PF is not as efficient as AF without antenna selection. However with dual-antenna selection at the relay, PF has practically the same performance as AF even in a time-selective fading environment. We thus believe that PF is a cost-effective alternative to AF and DF, since signal re-modulation and expensive linear amplifiers are no longer needed at the relay to support non-constant envelope transmission. Finally, this phase-forward concept can be generalized to other continuous-phase modulation schemes as well as to PSK.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5635475/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742918","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Transmission with Constant Envelope Modulations and Phase-Only Forward Relays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Transmission with Constant Envelope Modulations and Phase-Only Forward Relays","sourcePdf":"114-tw1101-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070362S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5635475","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5635484,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Wen","affiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Wen","id":"37711847400"},{"name":"Weijia Jia","affiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Jia","id":"37266130300"},{"name":"Wei Zhou","affiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37590581700"},{"name":"Wanlei Zhou","affiliation":["Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Wanlei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37271785700"},{"name":"Chuan Xu","affiliation":["Chongqing University, Chongqing, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37596915200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8484-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4159-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635484","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":973},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","IP networks","Kalman filters","Calibration","Filtering theory","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypermedia","IP networks","Kalman filters","security of data","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed denial of service","flash crowd mimic","CALD","Internet threat","application layer based DDoS attack","HTTP request","Web site","Web server","abnormal traffic monitor","ATTENTION signal","IP network","Kalman filter","security module"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DDos","Application-layer DDoS","Kalman filter","Information Theory"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CALD: Surviving Various Application-Layer DDoS Attacks That Mimic Flash Crowd","abstract":"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a continuous critical threat to the Internet. Derived from the low layers, new application-layer-based DDoS attacks utilizing legitimate HTTP requests to overwhelm victim resources are more undetectable. The case may be more serious when such attacks mimic or occur during the flash crowd event of a popular Website. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CALD, an architectural extension to protect Web servers against various DDoS attacks that masquerade as flash crowds. CALD provides real-time detection using mess tests but is different from other systems that use resembling methods. First, CALD uses a front-end sensor to monitor the traffic that may contain various DDoS attacks or flash crowds. Intense pulse in the traffic means possible existence of anomalies because this is the basic property of DDoS attacks and flash crowds. Once abnormal traffic is identified, the sensor sends ATTENTION signal to activate the attack detection module. Second, CALD dynamically records the average frequency of each source IP and check the total mess extent. Theoretically, the mess extent of DDoS attacks is larger than the one of flash crowds. Thus, with some parameters from the attack detection module, the filter is capable of letting the legitimate requests through but the attack traffic stopped. Third, CALD may divide the security modules away from the Web servers. As a result, it keeps maximum performance on the kernel web services, regardless of the harassment from DDoS. In the experiments, the records from www.sina.com and www.taobao.com have proved the value of CALD.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635484","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634608/5635482/05635484.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSS.2010.69","startPage":"247","endPage":"254","doi":"10.1109/NSS.2010.69","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"CALD: Surviving Various Application-Layer DDoS Attacks That Mimic Flash Crowd","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5635484/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11653668","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CALD: Surviving Various Application-Layer DDoS Attacks That Mimic Flash Crowd","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4159a247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060257S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634608","isNumber":"5635482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634608","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5635482","articleId":"5635484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5635492,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Pin Yang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Pin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406097300"},{"name":"Chih-Kung Kung","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Kung","lastName":"Kung","id":"37589982800"},{"name":"Fang-Tsung Liu","affiliation":["Electric Communication Department, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fang-Tsung","lastName":"Liu","id":"37594329700"},{"name":"Yu-Ju Chen","affiliation":["Information Management Department, Cheng Shiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ju","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293329800"},{"name":"Chuo-Yean Chang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Cheng Shiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuo-Yean","lastName":"Chang","id":"37290547700"},{"name":"Rey-Chue Hwang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rey-Chue","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37286966900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635492","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Logic gates","Integrated circuit modeling","Hardware","Evolutionary computation","Logic circuits","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","logic circuits","logic design","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuit design","particle swarm optimization","neural network","offline gate level sample"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["logic circuit design","neural network","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635492","abstract":"In this paper, a new logic circuit design technique by using neural network and particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is proposed.

CR systems will operate in heterogeneous networks in which efficient use of resources will require control of both transmission rate and power for active CRs. In this paper we propose an algorithm for resource allocation in dynamic spectrum access ad-hoc networks where active CR links satisfy their own quality-of-service (QoS) requirements as well as the interference constraints to respect the incumbent primary user-transmissions. We formulate the problem of joint transmission rate and power control for active CR links to maximize their surplus (or net utility) functions using distributed interference compensation as a non-cooperative game.

The recent development of compressive sensing theory enables sub-Nyquist sampling. In this paper, we utilize an implementation approach of sub-Nyquist sampling--Modulated Wide Converter (MWC)-to demodulate a given frequency band from multiband signal of radio transmission. The paper analyzes the behavior in frequency domain of MWC sampling and reveals the essence of sampling process as spectrum segmenting. Considering demodulation of multiband signal, we optimize the spectrum segmentation through choosing optimal parameters for MWC to reduce the impact of nonideal analog lowpass filter. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the MWC with the improved configuration can eliminate the impact of analog filters and achieve perfect demodulation performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Demodulation","Wideband","Filtering theory","Frequency domain analysis","Frequency modulation","Bismuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","demodulation","frequency-domain analysis","low-pass filters","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital demodulation method","amplitude signal modulation","sub Nyquist sampling","wideband radio transmission","compressive sensing theory","modulated wide converter","multiband signal","frequency domain analysis","spectrum segmentation","analog lowpass filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sub-Nyquist sampling","Modulated wide converter","Digital demodulating","Compressive sensing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.208","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05635650.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital Demodulation Method for Amplitude Modulated Signal Based on Sub-Nyquist Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Digital Demodulation Method for Amplitude Modulated Signal Based on Sub-Nyquist Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635650/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635650/","accessionNumber":"11655248","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digital Demodulation Method for Amplitude Modulated Signal Based on Sub-Nyquist Sampling","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042399S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5635650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5635684,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenlin Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhenlin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37593002400"},{"name":"Yanfeng Gu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yanfeng","lastName":"Gu","id":"37273848700"},{"name":"Ye Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279965600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635684","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Hyperspectral imaging","Signal to noise ratio","Transforms","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","principal component analysis","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction algorithm","hyperspectral anomaly detection","principal component analysis","minimum noise fraction transform","local singularity measure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperspectral images","anomaly detection","feature extraction","feature selection"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection is one of the most important applications for hyperspectral images. Conventional algorithm such as Reed-Xiaoli (RX) detector fails to be applied to hyperspectral images, which have high spectral dimensionality and complicated correlation between spectral bands. Therefore, effective feature extraction methods and selection rules are necessary. In this paper, comparative analyses of feature extraction methods with different rules are conducted, illustrating their effects on application of anomaly detection in hyperspectral images. The algorithms for feature extraction include principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF) transform and their kernel versions. The rules for feature selection are energy and signal-to-noise (SNR). Furthermore, a local singularity (LS) measure is introduced to select the most singular component transformed for anomaly detection, based on local high-order statistics, i.e., skewness and kurtosis. Numerical experiments are performed on real hyperspectral images. The results show that using KPCA with LS measure greatly improves detection performance of the conventional RX algorithm and achieves satisfying effect, and the LS measure is more effective than other rules.","doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.78","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05635684.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Feature Extraction Algorithms with Different Rules for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635684/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Feature Extraction Algorithms with Different Rules for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655259","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635684/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Analysis of Feature Extraction Algorithms with Different Rules for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052158S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5635684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5635686,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Guo","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532545100"},{"name":"Zhixin Zhao","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhixin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37598700500"},{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Electrical and Information Engineering College, Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37067679400"},{"name":"Liang Chang","affiliation":["Electrical and Information Engineering College, Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37596841100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635686","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Resource management","Throughput","Quality of service","OFDM","Signal processing algorithms","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","quality of service","queueing theory","resource allocation","telecommunication control","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel-aware queue-aware resource allocation algorithm","heterogeneous multiuser downlink OFDMA system","delay-constrained traffic","nondelay-constrained traffic","suboptimal joint subcarrier and power allocation","NDC traffic","logarithmic utility function","queue state information","channel state information","QoS","proportional fairness algorithm","delay control factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["delay-constrained traffic","proportional fairness","QoS","throughput","delay"]}],"abstract":"For the issue of resource allocation in a heterogeneous multi-user downlink OFDMA system with both delay-constrained (DC) and non-delay-constrained (NDC) traffic, this paper proposes suboptimal joint subcarrier and power allocation (JSPA) for channel-aware queue-aware(CAQA) scheduling. The objective is to maximize the sum of all NDC users' logarithmic utility functions (achieving proportional fairness) while satisfying various delay requirements of DC users. By queue state information (QSI) and channel state information (CSI) of DC users, the algorithm firstly combines subcarrier and power allocation to satisfy users' QoS (delay and bit outage probability), and then the residual system resources are allocated to NDC users by proportional fairness(PF) algorithm. In order to satisfy each DC user's delay constrain, we define a delay control factor which also can balance DC users' delay and NDC users' throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can guarantee all DC users' QoS and the average delay fairness among them and offers high throughput while maintaining proportional fairness among all NDC users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Channel-Aware Queue-Aware Resource Allocation Algorithm for OFDMA System with Heterogenous Delay Requirements","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.44","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05635686.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Channel-Aware Queue-Aware Resource Allocation Algorithm for OFDMA System with Heterogenous Delay Requirements","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635686/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655260","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Channel-Aware Queue-Aware Resource Allocation Algorithm for OFDMA System with Heterogenous Delay Requirements","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061581S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5635686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5635688,"authors":[{"name":"Madoka Yuriyama","affiliation":["IBM Research-Tokyo, IBM Japan Limited, Yamato, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Madoka","lastName":"Yuriyama","id":"37601846200"},{"name":"Takayuki Kushida","affiliation":["IBM Research-Tokyo, IBM Japan Limited, Yamato, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Kushida","id":"37339943800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8053-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4167-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0418"}],"articleNumber":"5635688","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":207,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":4152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Monitoring","Portals","Clouds","Browsers","Cloud computing","User interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","Internet","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor cloud infrastructure","physical sensor","sensor data","IT infrastructure","cloud computing","sensor management","dynamic grouped virtual sensor","ubiquitous computing","sensor network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor Networks","Ubiquitous Computing","Cloud Computing"]}],"abstract":"Increasing numbers of physical sensors are used for various purposes.

It is indicated that S-IDMA can achieve fast synchronization with low computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05635722.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Synchronization Scheme for IDMA with Low Complexity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Synchronization","Transmitters","Complexity theory","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","error statistics","iterative methods","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization scheme","spreading-IDMA","low computational complexity","interleave division multiple access","code division multiple access","CDMA","signal to interference-plus-noise ratio","iteration detection process","correlation operation","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["acquisition","IDMA","Spreading-IDMA","synchronization","iterative multiuser detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Synchronization Scheme for IDMA with Low Complexity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661205","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Synchronization Scheme for IDMA with Low Complexity","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063652S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5635722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5635737,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbo Bai","affiliation":["Department of Optics and Electrics Engineering, Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yongbo","lastName":"Bai","id":"37594177300"},{"name":"Zili Chen","affiliation":["Department of Optics and Electrics Engineering, Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Zili","lastName":"Chen","id":"37984307700"},{"name":"Ruibo Hou","affiliation":["Department of Optics and Electrics Engineering, Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Ruibo","lastName":"Hou","id":"37586546600"},{"name":"Dongsheng Qi","affiliation":["Department of Optics and Electrics Engineering, Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Qi","id":"37590288800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635737","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":599},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Signal processing algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Least squares approximation","Filtering algorithms","Generators","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","equalisers","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","field programmable gate array","channel equalizer","LMS algorithm","wireless communication","inter-symbol interference","Xilinx system generator","DSP develop software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LMS algorithm","Channel equalizer","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635737","abstract":"In wireless communication, equalization is an effective technology to change channel characteristics and reduce the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).

Once the required QoS is achieved for all sources, the weight factor for all sources will be unity. The remaining resources are allocated to the sources with maximum instantaneous rate. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the greedy and static algorithms in terms of outage probability and fairness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Algorithm for OFDMA Cooperative Relay Networks with Fairness and Qos Guaranteed","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Network Applications, Protocols and Services","doi":"10.1109/NETAPPS.2010.40","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Network Applications, Protocols and Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634611/5635594/05635807.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETAPPS.2010.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Algorithm for OFDMA Cooperative Relay Networks with Fairness and Qos Guaranteed","conferenceDate":"22-23 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635807/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Algorithm for OFDMA Cooperative Relay Networks with Fairness and Qos Guaranteed","confLoc":"Alor Setar, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"4177a188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053715S","chronDate":"22-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634611","isNumber":"5635594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634611","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5635594","articleId":"5635807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5635829,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Ying","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Ying","id":"37547400000"},{"name":"Xueying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291969300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635829","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"A number of recent studies have focused on the speech emotion recognition.

The first kind is one language experiments with TYUT database and Berlin database. The results of this kind experiments show that ZCPA features can represent speech emotion effectively. The second kind experiment is cross-database of three languages. Experiments of the second kind indicate that the ZCPA features are database independent.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Databases","Speech recognition","Feature extraction","Emotion recognition","Support vector machines","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","emotion recognition","feature extraction","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-crossings","speech emotion classification","emotional features extraction","peak-amplitudes","TYUT database","Berlin database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["emotion recognition","ZCPA","speech database","SVM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.86","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05635829.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Zero-Crossings with Peak-Amplitudes in Speech Emotion Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Zero-Crossings with Peak-Amplitudes in Speech Emotion Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635829/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635829/","accessionNumber":"11655288","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Zero-Crossings with Peak-Amplitudes in Speech Emotion Classification","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048189S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5635829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5635872,"authors":[{"name":"Na Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533036900"},{"name":"Ningqing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ningqing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37596691500"},{"name":"Weixiao Meng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Weixiao","lastName":"Meng","id":"37396922600"},{"name":"Qiyue Yu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qiyue","lastName":"Yu","id":"37404596100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635872","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Power distribution","Ad hoc networks","Wireless communication","Heuristic algorithms","Batteries","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted clustering algorithm","power distribution","cooperative communication network","spatial diversity gain","cluster-head number","load balancing factor","4G system","bit rate 100 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","power reward","clustering","WCA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635872","abstract":"Cooperative communications is widely used to share the resources of different nodes, and achieve spatial diversity gain in multi-user network. The node which is chosen as cooperative node (cluster-head), consumes more transmit power for other nodes than itself. Because of this, traditional algorithm results in uneven power distribution. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called weighted clustering algorithm based on power distribution (PDWCA) to solve the problem. Compared with traditional weighted clustering algorithm (WCA), the proposed algorithm adds a new weight factor decided by the power reward, which evaluates the power contributed to or service by others so as to guarantee uniform power distribution. In this paper, we also give a new definition of the measure of mobility which is more clear than the traditional one. Simulations results show that the performances are similar to WCA in terms of cluster-head number and load balancing factor (LBF); meanwhile, it can reach much better improvement on average transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.43","startPage":"142","endPage":"145","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05635872.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Weighted Clustering Algorithm Based on Power Distribution for Cooperative Communication Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Weighted Clustering Algorithm Based on Power Distribution for Cooperative Communication Network","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635872/","accessionNumber":"11655308","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635872/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Weighted Clustering Algorithm Based on Power Distribution for Cooperative Communication Network","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06611S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5635872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5635922,"authors":[{"name":"Yingnan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China","College of Physics Science & Information Engineering, Jishou University Computer Science & Technology, Jinshou, China"],"firstName":"Yingnan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403483000"},{"name":"Yan Ma","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37592739600"},{"name":"Shiwei Ji","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Shiwei","lastName":"Ji"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635922","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Wavelet transforms","Face","Training","Accuracy","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principal component analysis","virtual reality","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","single training image","wavelet transform","virtual information","one sample per person problem","PCA-based classify process","ORL face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","single training image per person","virtual information","wavelet transform","PCA"]}],"abstract":"One of the most challenging tasks for face recognition lies in the so-called one sample per person problem. Numerous face recognition techniques will suffer serious performance drop or even fail to work in this situation. To solving it, a method based on wavelet transform and virtual information (WV-based) is proposed in this paper. First, it performs the wavelet transform on face images, then it selects the lowest frequency part with less resolution and the major information comparing to the original. Second, it does small-angle rotation on the sample image to construct virtual samples. Finally, the PCA-based classify process is done. We use ORL face database to test our method and the experimental results show its practicality and efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition with Single Training Image per Person Based on Wavelet Transform and Virtual Information","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.74","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05635922.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5635922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition with Single Training Image per Person Based on Wavelet Transform and Virtual Information","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5635922/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655325","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition with Single Training Image per Person Based on Wavelet Transform and Virtual Information","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059971S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5635922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5635926,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Tang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Tang","id":"37594337600"},{"name":"Mingyi Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingyi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37595833800"},{"name":"Zhongcai Pei","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongcai","lastName":"Pei","id":"37592042000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5635926","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":596},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Robot kinematics","Manipulator dynamics","Neurons","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","Jacobian matrices","manipulators","radial basis function networks","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive PID control strategy","RBF neural network","robot manipulator","Jacobian information","parameter uncertainty","weak adaptive ability","poor robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBF neural network","robot manipulator","adaptive PID control","on-line process identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635926","abstract":"To the strong nonlinearity and parameter uncertainty in robot manipulator control, a novel self-adaptive PID controller based on RBF neural network on-line identification for the robot manipulator is proposed in this paper, which has solved the weak adaptive ability and poor robustness of the conventional PID control.

Meanwhile, delay time-domain windowing technique has been introduced to suppress the noise power which perturbs the channel estimation. In this paper, we analysis the impact of delay time-domain windowing technique, the fading rate of the channel and the number of Rayleigh fading paths on the BER performance of DS-CDMA system with MMSE-FDE under MMSE channel estimation. Simulations show that delay time windowing technique can improve the BER performance significantly and such improvement grows with the increase of E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n/N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634605/5635480/05636109.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"631","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications","doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCSPA.2010.157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Frequency Domain Channel Estimation of DS-CDMA Communication System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Channel estimation","Rayleigh channels","Delay","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","diversity reception","equalisers","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","least mean squares methods","Rayleigh channels","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain channel estimation","DS-CDMA communication system","frequency domain equalization","single carrier system","MMSE based FDE","frequency diversity gain","delay time-domain windowing technique","noise power","fading rate","Rayleigh fading paths","BER performance","MMSE channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DS-CDMA","Channel estimation","Frequency domain equilization","MMSE","Delay time-domain windowing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Frequency Domain Channel Estimation of DS-CDMA Communication System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636109/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655378","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Frequency Domain Channel Estimation of DS-CDMA Communication System","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4180a628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038557S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634605","isNumber":"5635480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634605","xplore-issue":"5635480","articleId":"5636109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5636117,"authors":[{"name":"McKay D.

The targeted application includes IEEE 802.16 WiMax-based airport communications such as being proposed by the Euro control and FAA organizations-concept validation is currently underway using the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) network. Security enhancement via RF-DNA fingerprinting is motivated by earlier RF-DNA work using GMSK-based intra-cellular GSM signals and OFDM-based 802.11a peer-to-peer WiFi signals. The commonality that WiMax shares with these two existing communication systems, i.e., the cellular control structure of GSM and the multi-carrier OFDM modulation of 802.11a, suggests that RF-DNA fingerprinting may be effective for WiMax device discrimination. This is important given that WiMax shares some common features that may prove detrimental, to include bit-level authentication, privacy, and security mechanisms. It is reasonable to assume that these bit-level mechanisms will come under attack as ``hackers'' apply lessons learned from their previous successes. The contributions of this paper include: 1) the introduction of a Spectral Domain (SD) RF-DNA fingerprinting technique to augment previous Time Domain (TD) and Wavelet Domain (WD) techniques, and 2) a first look at AeroMACS physical waveform features and the potential applicability of RF-DNA fingerprinting using operationally collected signals.","doi":"10.1109/NSS.2010.21","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634608/5635482/05636117.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSS.2010.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF-DNA Fingerprinting for Airport WiMax Communications Security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636117/","displayDocTitle":"RF-DNA Fingerprinting for Airport WiMax Communications Security","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11653753","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636117/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF-DNA Fingerprinting for Airport WiMax Communications Security","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4159a032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078233S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634608","isNumber":"5635482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634608","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5635482","articleId":"5636117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5636120,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yan","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yan","id":"37589691200"},{"name":"Al-Dossary Saleh","affiliation":["Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Al-Dossary","lastName":"Saleh","id":"37587792300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4180-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5636120","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"abstract":"We present in this paper a modified bilateral filter that is able to enhance flow-like structure.

Therefore, almost all of the information system cannot survive as they confront the DDoS attacks. Although there are a lot of intrusion detection system (IDS) developed, preventing DDoS attack is still difficult and perplexing. In this paper, an early warning system for detecting DDoS attacking has been mounted to a traditional IDS to form a completely system. This early warning system is developed based on the rationale of time delay neural network. In the networking topology, each node is monitored with the deployment of detectors to establish a multilayer architecture. In addition, the activities of each node will be monitored by their neighboring nodes to check whether it is still survival or not mutually. After then, all of the attacking information will be collected and transferred to the expert module for integrating analysis. As those nodes dispatched on the DMZ or between the first and second layer of firewall face some attacking similar as the pattern of DDoS, the kernel expert module which dispatched behind the second firewall will take some feasible actions and initiate the defense strategies to protect the kernel information system. In the meanwhile, those failed nodes will be restarted and act as the role of vanguard to assure the networking under normal operation.","doi":"10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.178","startPage":"704","endPage":"707","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634604/5635543/05636160.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Warning System for DDoS Attacking Based on Multilayer Deployment of Time Delay Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Computer crime","Alarm systems","Monitoring","Nonhomogeneous media","Intrusion detection","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","delays","network topology","neural nets","safety systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["early warning system","DDoS attack","multilayer deployment","time delay neural network","distributed denial of service","network attack techniques","information security","intrusion detection system","networking topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information security","Time-delay neural network","Denial of service","Distributed denial of service","Internet hacking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Early Warning System for DDoS Attacking Based on Multilayer Deployment of Time Delay Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636160/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655125","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Warning System for DDoS Attacking Based on Multilayer Deployment of Time Delay Neural Network","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"4222a704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042898S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634604","isNumber":"5635543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634604","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5635543","articleId":"5636160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":5636189,"authors":[{"name":"Nafis Imtiaz Zaman","affiliation":["Medway School of Engineering, University of Greenwich, UK"],"firstName":"Nafis Imtiaz","lastName":"Zaman","id":"37542092900"},{"name":"Kazi Md.

Unfortunately traditional back-side cooling only scales with the chip stack footprint, but not with the number of tiers. Direct heat removal from the IC dies via inter-tier liquid cooling is a promising solution to address this problem. In this regard, a thermal-aware design of a 3D IC with liquid cooling for optimal electronic performance and reliability requires fast modeling and simulation of the liquid cooling during the early stages of the design. In this paper, we propose a novel compact transient thermal modeling (CTTM) scheme for liquid cooling in 3D ICs via microchannels and enhanced heat transfer cavity geometries such as pin-fin structures. The model is compatible with the existing thermal-CAD tools for ICs and offers significant speed-up over commercial computational fluid dynamics simulators (13478x for pin-fin geometry with 1.1% error in temperature). In addition, the model is highly flexible and it provides a generic framework in which heat transfer coefficient data from numerical simulations or existing correlations can be incorporated depending upon the speed/accuracy needs of the designer. We have also studied the effects of using different techniques for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients on the accuracy of the model. This study highlights the need to consider developing flow conditions to accurately model the temperature field in the chip stack. The use of correlation data from fully developed flows only results in temperature error as high as 9 K (about 41%) near the inlet.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636277","publicationTitle":"2010 16th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems (THERMINIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 16th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems (THERMINIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621663/5636277/05636341.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact transient thermal model for 3D ICs with liquid cooling via enhanced heat transfer cavity geometries","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compact transient thermal model for 3D ICs with liquid cooling via enhanced heat transfer cavity geometries","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636341/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11654698","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5636341/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact transient thermal model for 3D ICs with liquid cooling via enhanced heat transfer cavity geometries","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066631S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621663","isNumber":"5636277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621663","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5636277","articleId":"5636341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDA Publishing","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5636343,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, such an independently increased PHY layer capacity cannot be translated easily to MAC layer capacity gain unless special measures are taken in MAC protocols. For distributed WLANs with MIMO, subtle modifications in dominant MAC protocol CSMA/CA can give rise to a simple, yet practicable, MIMO aware MAC. When employing such MAC for single user spatial multiplexing, throughput is increased linearly with the antenna elements in use; leaving the delay constant. However, for multi-user multiplexing, requirement of more and extended control packets exchange leads higher overhead which ultimately decreases the performance compared to single user multiplexing. But nevertheless, during various network scenarios mutli-user multiplexing, multi-user transmission, is more preferable for its capability to transmit multiple streams of data destined to multiple receivers at one transmission opportunity. In this paper, based on the analytical modeling and derived expressions, we present the performance analysis of CSMA/CA adapted multi-user transmission supporting MIMO aware MAC in terms of average throughput and delay.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636367/05636372.pdf","startPage":"V1-356","endPage":"V1-360","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636367","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of CSMA/CA adapted MIMO aware MAC for multi-user transmission in WLANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Multiplexing","Gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","carrier sense multiple access","MIMO communication","space division multiplexing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSMA-CA","MIMO aware MAC layer","multiuser transmission","spectral efficiency","PHY layer capacity","MAC protocol","distributed WLAN","antenna element","multiuser multiplexing","single user spatial multiplexing","multiple stream transmission","multiple receiver","multiple input multiple output communication","physical layer capacity","medium access control","carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CSMA/CA","MIMO aware MAC","Multi-user spatial multiplexing","WLAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of CSMA/CA adapted MIMO aware MAC for multi-user transmission in WLANs","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5636372/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654879","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of CSMA/CA adapted MIMO aware MAC for multi-user transmission in WLANs","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp077vol1A137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051034S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","xplore-issue":"5636367","articleId":"5636372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5636373,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Liao","affiliation":["School of Electrical &Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Bin Liao","id":"37586483000"},{"name":"Fen Peng","affiliation":["School of Electrical &Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fen Peng","id":"37597617400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636373","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Estimation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image segmentation","Manganese"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","feature extraction","image texture","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotation invariant texture features extraction","dual tree complex wavelet transform","content based image retrieval","texture rotation","texture translation","principal components analysis","PCA","DT-CWT","shift invariance approximation","good directional selectivity","computational efficiency properties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DT-CWT","image retrieval","PCA","rotation-invariant","texture feature"]}],"abstract":"Rotation-invariant texture features extraction plays an important role in content based image retrieval.

Experiment proves the approximate shift invariance, good directional selectivity; computational efficiency properties of DT-CWT make it a good candidate for representing the rotation-invariant texture features.","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636373","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636367/05636373.pdf","startPage":"V1-361","endPage":"V1-364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation-invariant texture features extraction using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636373/","displayDocTitle":"Rotation-invariant texture features extraction using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654880","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636373/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotation-invariant texture features extraction using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp078vol1A138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.215671S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","xplore-issue":"5636367","articleId":"5636373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5636384,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyou Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiangyou Lv","id":"37606422400"},{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tiankui Zhang","id":"37288850400"},{"name":"Zhimin Zeng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhimin Zeng","id":"37288929900"},{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Ministry of Industry and Information technology, China Academy of Telecommunication Research, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Wang","id":"37600184600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636384","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":808},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink multi-user MIMO interference cancellation algorithm","LTE-A systems","multiple access interference cancellation algorithm","channel matrix","channel state information","resource scheduling","transformation matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-A","multi-user MIMO","interference cancellation","matrix transformation"]}],"abstract":"An uplink multi-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiple access interference cancellation algorithm is proposed for Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) system. The base station (BS) obtains the null space of pairing user's channel matrix by channel state information, and then this null space is constructed as the transformation matrix which maintains the multiplexing degree of spatial channel. The received signal at the BS is processed by the transformation matrix, and the multiple access interference of pairing user can be eliminated. Furthermore, during the resource scheduling, the user equipments (UEs) which use the same codebook are confined to occupy the same time-frequency resource. So the probability of UEs with strong channel correlation paired each other is reduced, and the impact of transformation matrix on useful signal strength can be minimized. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can depress the multiple access interference of pairing user greatly and increase the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio of the user, and eventually improve the system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636384","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636367/05636384.pdf","startPage":"V1-294","endPage":"V1-297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink multi-user MIMO interference cancellation algorithm for LTE-A systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636384/","displayDocTitle":"Uplink multi-user MIMO interference cancellation algorithm for LTE-A systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654890","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636384/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink multi-user MIMO interference cancellation algorithm for LTE-A systems","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp065vol1A121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048311S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","xplore-issue":"5636367","articleId":"5636384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5636405,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Zhi-yong","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication Institute of PLA, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Shi Zhi-yong","id":"38277048700"},{"name":"Zhu Yan-jia","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication Institute of PLA, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Zhu Yan-jia","id":"38275517700"},{"name":"Li Hai-wen","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication Institute of PLA, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Li Hai-wen","id":"38271319300"},{"name":"Qing-bo Ou","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Qing-bo","lastName":"Ou"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636405","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Servers","Time division synchronous code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group call communication","TD-SCDMA network","packet switched domain link","group call service","packet data link allocation","PS protocols","OPNET software","time division synchronous code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["group call","packet-switched domain link","presence service","TD-SCDMA","OPNET"]}],"abstract":"Group call communication can meet the demand of the different location users sharing the same information at the same time. In TD-SCDMA network, the group call communication is realized by the high-speed packet-switched domain (PS). TD-SCDMA network can provide a wide communication range and other multimedia services for the group call user. The group call communication includes the group call service and the presence service. The presence service is to achieve the efficient, reliable and fast connection of the group call service. In view of the communication features of group call service, the limited PS resources and the non realtime packet switching, TD-SCDMA network structure which supports the group call service is designed. At the same time, the functions of packet-switched domain equipments are described. Then it is a focused discussion that TD-SCDMA system adopts packet data link allocation mechanism for group call service. The PS protocols of the group call communication are given in detail. Finally, the group call communication is simulated by using OPNET software. The performance of group call and the impact on TD-SCDMA network PS are analyzed. The result shows that the PS resources can be efficiently shared by group call members after adopting the rational network structure and PS access mechanism. It provides technical support for the development of group call service based on TD-SCDMA network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of packet-switched domain link for group call communication based on TD-SCDMA network","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636405","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636367/05636405.pdf","startPage":"V1-205","endPage":"V1-209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636367","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of packet-switched domain link for group call communication based on TD-SCDMA network","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5636405/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654912","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of packet-switched domain link for group call communication based on TD-SCDMA network","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp046vol1A086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051193S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5636367","articleId":"5636405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5636411,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Li","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute of Guangdong Power, Grid Corporation, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Zhi Li","id":"37089047563"},{"name":"Jia-yuan Hu","affiliation":["College of Power and Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Jia-yuan Hu","id":"37087896624"},{"name":"Shun-an Cao","affiliation":["College of Power and Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Shun-an Cao","id":"37087900248"},{"name":"Jian-li Xie","affiliation":["College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Jian-li Xie","id":"37087898661"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636411","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636411","abstract":"Prediction of breakdown voltage of transformer oil has a great significance to the fault diagnosis and daily maintenance of transformer. Based on the correlation of performance parameters of transformer oil and the prominent fault-tolerance, non-linear approximation, and self-learning capabilities of BP neural network, this paper constructed a prediction method of breakdown voltage via multi-parameter correlation under the development environment of Matlab. Through examining the routine monitoring data of transformer oil by gray correlation analysis, this paper excavated some parameters which have strong correlation with breakdown voltage. Then a relational model of breakdown voltage and those parameters was further constructed using BP neural network. The clustering centers used to train network were acquired through clustering the original monitoring data samples with fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. This method which uses clustering centers to train network can resolve natural problems of neural networks caused by large sample capacity, such as complication of net structure, inferior astringency, poor generalization ability, and so on. Test results show that the relative errors between predicted values and real values are all less than 10%, which indicates the significant practical values of this model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Training","Integrated circuits","Monitoring","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","backpropagation","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","fuzzy set theory","grey systems","maintenance engineering","pattern clustering","power engineering computing","power system faults","transformer oil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction technique","transformer oil breakdown voltage","multiparameter correlation","grey theory","BP neural network","fault diagnosis","daily maintenance","fault-tolerance","nonlinear approximation","Matlab","gray correlation analysis","relational model","fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grey correlation analysis","BP neural network","fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm","breakdown voltage","prediction"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636411","startPage":"V1-179","endPage":"V1-183","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636367/05636411.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction technique for transformer oil breakdown voltage via multi-parameter correlation based on grey theory and BP neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction technique for transformer oil breakdown voltage via multi-parameter correlation based on grey theory and BP neural network","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11654918","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5636411/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction technique for transformer oil breakdown voltage via multi-parameter correlation based on grey theory and BP neural network","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"rp040vol1A069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090578S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5636367","articleId":"5636411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5636443,"authors":[{"name":"Wenwen Ma","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wenwen Ma","id":"37592835500"},{"name":"Jie Song","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jie Song","id":"37595965300"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wei Wang","id":"37599746300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636443","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","minimisation","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic filled algorithm","global optimization","nonlinear programming","Hopfield neural network","filled function method","constrainted global optimization","dynamic minimizing phase","dynamic minimizing system","local minima"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Filled function","Differential dynamical systems","Nonlinear programming","Global optimization"]}],"abstract":"Combined the advantage of Hopfield neural network and filled function method, a dynamic filled algorithm will be presented for constrainted global optimization of nonlinear programming.

The simulation results show that MUD and array element number have a great impact on the performance of the proposed algorithm and the proposed admission control algorithm can promote the system performance effectively if proper noise rise threshold is set.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636454/05636482.pdf","startPage":"V2-408","endPage":"V2-412","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink performances in TDD-CDMA distributed wireless communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Wireless communication","Analytical models","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multiuser detection","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDD-CDMA distributed wireless communication system","uplink capacity","load factor","admission control algorithm","array element number"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed wireless communication system (DWCS)","admission control","interference estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Uplink performances in TDD-CDMA distributed wireless communication system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5636482/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654832","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink performances in TDD-CDMA distributed wireless communication system","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp094vol2A749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057978S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5636454","articleId":"5636482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5636484,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yu","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Tao Yu","id":"37594974100"},{"name":"Qin Liu","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Qin Liu","id":"37277488000"},{"name":"Pengyu Huang","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Pengyu Huang","id":"37336907200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636484","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","iterative methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multichannel spectrum sensing","energy-constrained cognitive radio network","CRN","iterative optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy-constrained","interference constraint","spectrum sensing","throughput maximization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal multi-channel spectrum sensing in energy-constrained cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636454","endPage":"V2-402","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636454/05636484.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636484","startPage":"V2-398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636484","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is an important functionality of Cognitive Radio (CR). In this paper, an optimal multi-channel spectrum sensing strategy for energy-constrained cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is proposed. Under constraints of energy consumption and interference to the primary communication network, the multi-channel spectrum sensing problem is formulated as an optimization problem. In order to maximize the average achievable throughput of the CRN, sensing times and decision thresholds on multiple channels are jointly optimized. An iterative optimization algorithm is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed iterative algorithm is effective, and the throughput performance of the CRN is improved significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11654835","htmlLink":"/document/5636484/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal multi-channel spectrum sensing in energy-constrained cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal multi-channel spectrum sensing in energy-constrained cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp092vol2A743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048955S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5636454","articleId":"5636484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5636491,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Jianping Zhang","id":"37601197800"},{"name":"Yongning Zhuo","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Yongning Zhuo","id":"37085922059"},{"name":"Yi Zhao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Yi Zhao","id":"37596265800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636491","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","MIMO communication","mobility management (mobile radio)","support vector machines","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile location","MIMO communication systems","least squares support vector machine","LS-SVM","ray-tracing channel model","delay-of-arrival","angle-of-arrival","angle-of-departure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","location","support vector machine","ray tracing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel method for the positioning issue in MIMO wireless communication system is proposed, which is based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM).

The main purpose of the MSE-OFDM system is to enhance the bandwidth efficiency deteriorated by the CP of each OFDM symbol in relative static wireless channel environment. In this paper, a detailed orthogonality analysis of the MSE-OFDM system is demonstrated, based on which an improvement that the OFDM symbols are encapsulated in the frequency domain is proposed. The modified system can reduce the time delay of processing in the receiver end. In the mean time it provides great flexibility for pilot insertion as traditional OFDM system. For static wireless channel, more redundancy is eliminated with nearly the same bit error rate (BER) compared to the MSE-OFDM system. While for slowly mobile channel, such as the user end is at the speed of walking, lower BER is performed.","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636521","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636367/05636521.pdf","startPage":"V1-433","endPage":"V1-437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonality analysis and improvement of MSE-OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636521/","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonality analysis and improvement of MSE-OFDM system","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654960","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636521/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonality analysis and improvement of MSE-OFDM system","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp093vol1A161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054764S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","xplore-issue":"5636367","articleId":"5636521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5636537,"authors":[{"name":"David Cuddeback","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, California Polytechnic State University, San Louis Obispo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cuddeback","id":"37585790500"},{"name":"Alex Dekhtyar","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, California Polytechnic State University, San Louis Obispo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Dekhtyar","id":"37282594100"},{"name":"Jane Hayes","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Hayes","id":"37959175600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8022-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-6441"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1090-705X"}],"articleNumber":"5636537","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":919},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636537","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Accuracy","Training","Information retrieval","Computer science","Software","Large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program verification","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated requirements traceability","human analysts","requirements traceability matrix","software engineering","software verification","Java code formatter program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["traceability","requirements","information retrieval","decision support"]}],"abstract":"The requirements traceability matrix (RTM) supports many software engineering and software verification and validation (V&V) activities such as change impact analysis, reverse engineering, reuse, and regression testing.

When using RTMs to support the V&V of mission-or safety-critical systems, however, a human analyst must vet the candidate RTMs. The focus thus becomes the quality of the final RTM. This paper investigate show human analysts perform when vetting candidate RTMs. Specifically, a study was undertaken at two universities and had 26 participants analyze RTMs of varying accuracy for a Java code formatter program. The study found that humans tend to move their candidate RTM toward the line that represents recall = precision. Participants who examined RTMs with low recall and low precision drastically improved both.","publicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634607/5636534/05636537.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2010.35","doi":"10.1109/RE.2010.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Requirements Traceability: The Study of Human Analysts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated Requirements Traceability: The Study of Human Analysts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636537/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5636537/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11653573","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Requirements Traceability: The Study of Human Analysts","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4162a231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047572S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634607","isNumber":"5636534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634607","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5636534","articleId":"5636537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5636553,"authors":[{"name":"Imen Bahri","affiliation":["SATIE lUP GEII, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Imen","lastName":"Bahri","id":"37541326500"},{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["SATIE lUP GEII, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Monmasson","id":"37294192700"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Verdier","affiliation":["ETIS CNRS UMR 8051, ENSEA, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Verdier","id":"37393902000"},{"name":"Mohamed El-Amin Ben Khelifa","affiliation":["ETIS CNRS UMR 8051, ENSEA, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed El-Amin","lastName":"Ben Khelifa","id":"38180790200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6390-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6391-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5636553","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"abstract":"The focus of this paper is to present a System-on-Programmable-Chip (SoPC) solution, including several heterogeneous cores, for synchronous motor control.

A Resolver Processing Unit (RPU), which computes the rotor position and speed from the resolver sensor, is developed. The analog to digital conversion is ensured by an integrated ADC avoiding the use of external converters. To evaluate the integration performance of used SoPC, two implementation schemes are described. The first control scheme is implemented entirely on FPGA matrix.

Commercial power quality measurement systems are available and offer good performance, communication and storage capabilities, and other special features, however in most of them the real-time information is not available or it is offered with important communication delays.

Experimental results show that the implemented system can be employed for power quality monitoring and embedded control applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5636556","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05636556.pdf","startPage":"2777","endPage":"2782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5636556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time evaluation of power quality using FPGA based measurement system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Real-time evaluation of power quality using FPGA based measurement system","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636556/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653458","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time evaluation of power quality using FPGA based measurement system","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"2777bf004618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10757S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5636556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5636559,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In transformerless systems the photovoltaic module parasitic capacitance can introduce leakage currents in which the amplitude depends on the converter topology, on the pulse-width-modulation and on the resonant circuit composed by the system components. In this paper a modulation technique for three-phase neutral point clamped multilevel inverters is proposed to eliminate the leakage current in photovoltaic systems without requiring any modification on the multilevel inverter. The neutral point clamped inverter is studied for systems with function of active filter using the p-q theory. The proposed system presents control of the maximum power point and compensation of current harmonics and reactive power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5636559/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653460","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transformerless photovoltaic systems using neutral point clamped multilevel inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformerless photovoltaic systems using neutral point clamped multilevel inverters","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1131bf015458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069395S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5636559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5636565,"authors":[{"name":"Grain Philip Adam","affiliation":["Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Grain Philip","lastName":"Adam","id":"37400892100"},{"name":"Stephen Jon Finney","affiliation":["Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen Jon","lastName":"Finney","id":"37276187100"},{"name":"Barry Wayne Williams","affiliation":["Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Barry Wayne","lastName":"Williams","id":"37274901800"},{"name":"Mohammed.

Experimental results shows that for 2-D images, compressive sensing with 2-D DCT can achieve better performance than 1-D DCT whether in PSNR values or visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/CASoN.2010.92","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634609/5636450/05636586.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASoN.2010.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636450","startPage":"378","endPage":"381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing for DCT Image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing for DCT Image","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636586/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11653763","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5636586/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing for DCT Image","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"4202a378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080262S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634609","isNumber":"5636450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634609","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5636450","articleId":"5636586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5636594,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086214033"},{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38184221700"},{"name":"Yaohong Qu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yaohong","lastName":"Qu","id":"37531378000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8785-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5636594","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Programming","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic programming","Stability analysis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization programming","parallel stochastic optimization algorithm","discrete PSO algorithm","discrete optimization","continuous PSO","genetic programming","convergence precision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GP Algorithm","PSO","two linear tables"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636594","abstract":"PSO is a parallel stochastic optimization algorithm with advantages of less parameters and high efficiency.

Several modeling languages were proposed so far to specify PL. Although they can be very different, these languages show two common features: they emphasize (a) variability, and (b) the specification of constraints to define acceptable configurations. It is now widely acknowledged that configuring a product can be considered as a constraint satisfaction problem. It is thus natural to consider constraint programming as a first choice candidate to specify constraints on PL. For instance, the different constraints that can be specified using the FODA language can easily be expressed using boolean constraints, which enables automated calculation and configuration using a SAT solver. But constraint programming proposes other domains than the boolean domain: for instance integers, real, or sets. The integer domain was, for instance, proposed by Benavides to specify constraints on feature attributes. This paper proposes to further explore the use of integer constraint programming to specify PL constraints. The approach was implemented in a prototype tool. Its use in a real case showed that constraint programming encompasses different PL modeling languages (such as FORE, OVM, or else), and allows specifying complex constraints that are difficult to specify with these languages.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634607/5636534/05636640.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"251","publicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","doi":"10.1109/RE.2010.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2010.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Integer Constraint Solving in Reuse Based Requirements Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Programming","Actuators","Vibrations","Visualization","Program processors","Time factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","integer programming","software reusability","systems analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reuse based requirements engineering","product lines","PL","reuse based systems development","constraint satisfaction problem","constraint programming","boolean constraints","automated calculation","integer constraint programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Product Line","Variability Model","Constraint Programing","Integer Constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Using Integer Constraint Solving in Reuse Based Requirements Engineering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636640/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11653611","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Integer Constraint Solving in Reuse Based Requirements Engineering","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4162a243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052895S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634607","isNumber":"5636534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634607","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5636534","articleId":"5636640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5636641,"authors":[{"name":"Aiping Ning","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, China","College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Aiping","lastName":"Ning","id":"37603472500"},{"name":"Xueying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291969300"},{"name":"Hui Sun","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596254600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8785-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5636641","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Speech recognition","Algorithm design and analysis","Acceleration","Heuristic algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition system","fuzzy neural network","time variant PSO","particle swarm optimization","structure equivalent FNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time variant parames particle swarm optimization","structure equivalence fuzzy neural network","speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"In order to overcome shortages of fuzzy neural network (FNN) and basic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, the article proposes a novel method that the parameters of structure equivalent FNN (SEFNN) trained by Time Variant Particle Swarm Optimization (TVPSO) algorithm.

While the detection method is based on the novel concept of Low Transient Pulse (LTP), the overall system implementation utilizes two microelectronics technologies: Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The DSP carries out the analysis of the received signal at a much lower rate hence can accommodate a large number of signal channels. The FPGA runs at a higher frequency (62.5MHz) to generate the LTP signal and to calculate the envelope of the received signal (sampled at 1MHz). This research elaborates on designing a Quadrature AM (QAM) demodulator on the FPGA for the received signal from the ultrasound and for the detection of the presence of edges/fracture on the test materials. The complete system is designed and optimized in a high level Matlab\\Simulink fixed point simulation. Different sub-blocks are then implemented and optimized on the FPGA where efforts are taken to maintain its accuracy with the simulated model. In this work, the technology is applied to determine the location of the Sawbone plate edges based on the received signals which are then passed through a QAM demodulator in the FPGA and a peak detector in the DSP to calculate the echo peak times.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5636657","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05636657.pdf","startPage":"2753","endPage":"2758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5636657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FPGA/DSP design for real-time fracture detection using Low Transient Pulse","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636657/","displayDocTitle":"A FPGA/DSP design for real-time fracture detection using Low Transient Pulse","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11652994","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636657/","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A FPGA/DSP design for real-time fracture detection using Low Transient Pulse","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"2753bf019968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092449S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5636657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5636711,"authors":[{"name":"Wanliang Wang","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Wanliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37423080600"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37601227600"},{"name":"Xinli Xu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xinli","lastName":"Xu","id":"37595310200"},{"name":"Jing Jie","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Jie","id":"37267563500"},{"name":"Haiyan Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599290900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8785-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5636711","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Job shop scheduling","Particle swarm optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Benchmark testing","Processor scheduling","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","job shop scheduling","particle swarm optimisation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid discrete particle swarm optimization","job shop scheduling problem","NP-hard problem","two layer population structure","simulated annealing algorithm","global optimum solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","particle swarm algorithm","job shop scheduling","makespan","simulated annealing algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636711","abstract":"The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a well known NP-hard problem, and many algorithms have been presented to solve it, but the results are still unsatisfactory.

We also present a nontrivial application to modelling load-balancing in server farms.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636730","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM 14th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM 14th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634610/5636691/05636730.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DS-RT.2010.19","startPage":"87","endPage":"96","doi":"10.1109/DS-RT.2010.19","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Kiltera: A Language for Timed, Event-Driven, Mobile and Distributed Simulation","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5636730/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654005","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kiltera: A Language for Timed, Event-Driven, Mobile and Distributed Simulation","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"4251a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055165S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634610","isNumber":"5636691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634610","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5636691","articleId":"5636730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5636781,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lin Xiao","id":"37600891600"},{"name":"Kai Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Kai Liu","id":"38247748700"},{"name":"Lin Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lin Ma","id":"37291474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636781","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":731},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","signal-to-noise ratio","secondary user"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","cooperative spectrum sensing","weight"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A weighted cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636454","endPage":"V2-48","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636454/05636781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636781","startPage":"V2-45","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636781","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), different received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of secondary users (SUs) lead to different reliability of their local spectrum sensing decisions, and then greatly affect sensing capability of cooperative spectrum sensing. Cooperative spectrum sensing with traditional hard decisions can not improve sensing capability efficiently due to allocating the same weight to SUs' decisions. Therefore, a weighted cooperative spectrum sensing (WCSS) is proposed for CRNs to improve sensing capability. It obtains weights of SUs' decisions from their average received SNRs, integrates both their independent decisions and weights to fuse data, and makes a final sensing decision. Simulation results show that compared to cooperative spectrum sensing with traditional hard decisions, WCSS performs better at low SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11654774","htmlLink":"/document/5636781/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A weighted cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A weighted cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp013vol2A236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076839S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5636454","articleId":"5636781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5636802,"authors":[{"name":"Chiou-Yng Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information and Network Engineering, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiou-Yng","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292809300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8785-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5636802","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Linear code","Arrays","Galois fields","Cryptography","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","encoding","error detection codes","field programmable gate arrays","linear algebra","linear codes","parity check codes","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent error detection","systolic array AB2 multiplier","linear block codes","linear encoding algebra","parity-check functionality","syndrome value","FPGA","CED multiplier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear code","Concurrent error detection(CED)","Finite field multiplication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636802","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634609/5636450/05636802.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASoN.2010.32","doi":"10.1109/CASoN.2010.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636450","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent Error Detection in Systolic Array AB^2 Multiplier Using Linear Codes","abstract":"This investigation is based on a traditional AB\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n systolic array multiplier to derive a new CED AB2 multiplier using linear block codes.

Its purpose is to enable requirements researchers and practitioners to recruit relevant theories, models, techniques and tools from creative problem solving to understand and support requirements processes more effectively. It uses 4 drivers to motivate the case for requirements engineering as a creative problem solving process. It then maps established requirements activities onto one of the longest-established creative problem solving processes, and uses these mappings to locate opportunities for the application of creative problem solving in requirements engineering. The second half of the paper describes selected creativity theories, techniques, software tools and training that can be adopted to improve requirements engineering research and practice. The focus is on support for problem and idea finding - two creative problem solving processes that our investigation revealed are poorly supported in requirements engineering. The paper ends with a research agenda to incorporate creative processes, techniques, training and tools in requirements projects.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634607/5636534/05636900.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","doi":"10.1109/RE.2010.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2010.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Requirements Engineering as Creative Problem Solving: A Research Agenda for Idea Finding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Problem-solving","Programming","Technological innovation","Software tools","Driver circuits","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software engineering","systems analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["requirements engineering","creative problem solving","research agenda","idea finding","recruit relevant theories","support requirements processes","software tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Requirements engineering","creativity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Requirements Engineering as Creative Problem Solving: A Research Agenda for Idea Finding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5636900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11653629","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Requirements Engineering as Creative Problem Solving: A Research Agenda for Idea Finding","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4162a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082419S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634607","isNumber":"5636534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634607","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5636534","articleId":"5636900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5636906,"authors":[{"name":"Ke-you Hu","affiliation":["College of Computer and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Ke-you","lastName":"Hu","id":"37591553700"},{"name":"Ling-yan Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Ling-yan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600226200"},{"name":"Hai-fang Li","affiliation":["College of Computer and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Hai-fang","lastName":"Li","id":"37407167400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8785-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5636906","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636906","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Image color analysis","Clustering algorithms","Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Programming","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","feature extraction","image colour analysis","knowledge based systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rules extraction","neural network","immune programming algorithm","China affective picture system","landscape image color feature","emotion values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["color feature extraction","rule extraction","clustering algorithm","immune programming algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CASoN.2010.83","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634609/5636450/05636906.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks","startPage":"341","endPage":"343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASoN.2010.83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rules Extraction from Neural Network Based on Immune Programming Algorithm","abstract":"From the functional point of view, a method that employed an Immune Programming algorithm to extract rules from Neural Network (NN) was presented.

A proved useful method for solving this problem is incremental attribute learning (IAL) which gradually trains input features in one or more size. Hence a new preprocessing called feature ordering should be introduced in pattern classification. In previous IAL studies of pattern classification, feature ordering was ranked by discrimination ability which was derived from a neural network with a single input and all outputs. Such a method which is similar to wrappers in feature selection is applicable for high-dimensional pattern classification problems. However, due to the fact that it is time-consuming, a substitute approach for feature ordering is presented in this paper, where feature ordering is ranked by redundancy and relevance using mRMR method. Experimental results show that feature ordering derived by mRMR can not only save time, but also obtain the best classification rate based on ITID, a neural IAL model, compared with those in previous studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636963/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11654789","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5636963/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pattern classification with ordered features using mRMR and neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern classification with ordered features using mRMR and neural networks","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"rp032vol2A300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040377S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5636454","articleId":"5636963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5636970,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Lv","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Tao Lv","id":"37587339900"},{"name":"Fu Rong Xie","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Fu Rong Xie","id":"37603700700"},{"name":"Yuan Jia","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yuan Jia","id":"37591968900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8106-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8104-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-5476"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-5484"}],"articleNumber":"5636970","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","indexing","information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVA-index","indexing method","similarity search","high-dimensional vector space","high-dimensional indexing","multidimensional data retrieval","vector approximation","hash table","VA-file","disk access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-dimensional indexing","HVA-Index","Vector Approximation","Hash Table"]}],"abstract":"High-dimensional indexing plays a critical role in multidimensional data retrieval. In this work, we propose a new indexing method, named HVA-Index, for similarity search in high-dimensional vector space. This index is based on Vector Approximation and Hash Table. The outstanding advantage is that it stores all vectors in a hash table using approximation as key, and the vectors fall into same cell are organized in a linked list. Contrast to VA-File, the HVA-Index doesn't require scan the entire approximation file, and efficiently improves the speed of similarity search. Our experiments prove that HVA-Index outperforms both of the VA-File and the sequential scan in total elapsed time and the number of disk access, and it's still effective at high dimensionality.","doi":"10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636970","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Information, Networking and Automation (ICINA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621666/5636454/05636970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636454","startPage":"V2-152","endPage":"V2-157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HVA-Index: An efficient indexing method for similarity search in high-dimensional vector spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HVA-Index: An efficient indexing method for similarity search in high-dimensional vector spaces","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5636970/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654800","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5636970/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HVA-Index: An efficient indexing method for similarity search in high-dimensional vector spaces","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"rp037vol2A314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043607S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621666","isNumber":"5636454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621666","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5636454","articleId":"5636970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5636979,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Argyropoulos","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Argyropoulos","id":"37395557600"},{"name":"Efthymios Kallos","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Efthymios","lastName":"Kallos","id":"37395557500"},{"name":"Atiqur Rahman","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Atiqur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37592542900"},{"name":"Yan Zhao","affiliation":["University of Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37291006300"},{"name":"Yang Hao","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Hao","id":"37269783400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5154-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5636979","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dispersion","Computational modeling","Lenses","Permittivity","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","lenses","metamaterials","optical dispersion","optical images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metallic nanolens","parallel three-dimensional dispersive FDTD method","subwavelength imaging","optical frequency","nanodevice"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a parallel three-dimensional dispersive FDTD method is introduced to model a nanolens.

Such drives equipped with a small DC-link capacitance exhibit instability tendencies, if installed on a soft line, giving a degraded performance. The total harmonic distortion (THD) and the partially weighted harmonic distortion (PWHD) of the line current are degraded, if resonance between the line impedance and the DC-link capacitance occurs. Likewise, the motor performance is affected negatively giving extra torque ripple, vibration and acoustic-noise emission.

The so-called Riemann sum method (RSM) is applied for the parametrisation of the simulation model. Furthermore, the statistical properties of the wideband MIMO V2V channel simulation model, such as the space-time-frequency cross-correlation function (STF-CCF), the two-dimensional spatial cross-correlation function (2D spatial CCF) and the temporal auto-correlation function (ACF) are studied. Finally, the high accuracy of the proposed simulation model is demonstrated by comparing the correlation properties of the simulation model with those of the underlying reference model. This research work is important for designers of MIMO V2V communication systems as the proposed simulation tool allows the analysis, optimization, and test of high data rate transmission schemes under realistic T-junction scattering conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 URSI International Symposium on Electromagnetic Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610909/5636977/05637080.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"2010 URSI International Symposium on Electromagnetic Theory","doi":"10.1109/URSI-EMTS.2010.5637080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSI-EMTS.2010.5637080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation model for wideband MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels in T-junction propagation environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational modeling","Wideband","Scattering","Fading","Correlation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","electromagnetic wave propagation","fading channels","MIMO communication","mobile radio","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation model","wideband multiple-input multiple-output vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels","T-junction propagation environments","Riemann sum method","statistical properties","space-time-frequency cross-correlation function","two-dimensional spatial cross-correlation function","temporal auto-correlation function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A simulation model for wideband MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels in T-junction propagation environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637080/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661086","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation model for wideband MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle fading channels in T-junction propagation environments","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p223zhou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049023S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610909","isNumber":"5636977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610909","xplore-issue":"5636977","articleId":"5637080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5637081,"authors":[{"name":"Tommi Laitinen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering SMARAD, Aalto University of Science and Technology, Aalto, Finland","Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Tommi","lastName":"Laitinen","id":"37266965000"},{"name":"Juha Toivanen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering SMARAD, Aalto University of Science and Technology, Aalto, Finland","Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Toivanen","id":"37266954800"},{"name":"Pekka Ky\u00f6sti","affiliation":["Elektrobit Oy Tutkijantie 8, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Ky\u00f6sti","id":"37542923300"},{"name":"Jukka-Pekka Nuutinen","affiliation":["Elektrobit Oy Tutkijantie 8, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jukka-Pekka","lastName":"Nuutinen","id":"37296620700"},{"name":"Pertti Vainikainen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering SMARAD, Aalto University of Science and Technology, Aalto, Finland","Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Pertti","lastName":"Vainikainen","id":"37280837800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5154-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5637081","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Antenna measurements","MIMO","Testing","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","mobile radio","receiving antennas","telecommunication equipment testing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OTA testing","multiprobe technology","MIMO terminals","mobile phones","transmit-receive antenna","2-D field synthesis","circular array"]}],"abstract":"Standardization work of the OTA test method for MIMO terminals is currently on-going.

Respect to previous works in the literature, the proposed approach evaluates the motor performance with a very limited number of simulations, making FEA optimization more attractive. The 3 goal functions (motor torque, torque ripple and flux weakening capability) are evaluated by means of 7 static FEA runs, that means nearly 20 seconds per tentative motor with a laptop computer. The paper is focused on the rotor design, since it is the most controversial part of IPM design and the most difficult to be modeled due to magnetic saturation. Three different approaches are presented: a fast one, based on 2- objective optimization, a hybrid one, based on 2-objective optimization and 3-objective refinement, and actual 3-objective optimization. The results presented here will be the base for future, more comprehensive optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637147/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11652903","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637147/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"IPM motor rotor design by means of FEA-based multi-objective optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IPM motor rotor design by means of FEA-based multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1340bf023019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097711S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5637187,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Parameter setting problem is generally solved by maximization or minimization of some objective evaluation functions such as correlation and statistical independence. However, the tuned filter output is not always adequate for face recognition system because filter and face recognition system are separately tuned using different criterions. It is also difficult to set an objective criterion for parameter setting because there are no correct solutions when we consider contrast adjustment problem. To handle such cases, we look to some subjective information such as face in the image, and directly employ facial recognition system as evaluation function for parameter setting. Experimental results show that cognition-based evaluation has a potential to adjust the image contrast.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637324","startPage":"3590","endPage":"3594","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637324.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognition-based contrast adjustment using neural network based face recognition system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Image recognition","Face","Artificial neural networks","Data preprocessing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition-based contrast adjustment","neural network","face recognition system","parameter setting problem","objective evaluation function","statistical independence","tuned filter output","contrast adjustment problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cognition-based contrast adjustment using neural network based face recognition system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637324/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653255","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognition-based contrast adjustment using neural network based face recognition system","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"3590bf013455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047416S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5637335,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas K\u00fcrner","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"K\u00fcrner","id":"37299707500"},{"name":"Moritz Schack","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Moritz","lastName":"Schack","id":"37294271600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5154-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5637335","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"abstract":"This contribution presents a 3D ray-tracing approach which is used as one major component in an integrated simulator for car-to-X communications consisting of a road traffic, a network and a radio propagation simulator.

The difference between traditional technology and today's technology is that a transforming power across large air pas can be achieved through recent research. Much electric equipment is proposed- both small one and large. For example, Wireless Power Transfer for small equipment (mobile phone and laptop) and for large equipment (electric vehicle). Furthermore, replacing every cord Wireless Power Transfer is proposed. The Coupled Mode Theory was theorized in 2006 and proven in 2007. Thus, magnetic and Electric Resonant Coupling allows power to traverse large air gaps with high efficiency. This technology is closely related to Electromagnetic Induction, antenna technology and resonator for the filters of communication technology. We have studied these phenomena and technologies using Equivalent Circuits- which is a more familiar and comprehensible format for electrical engineers than the Coupled Mode Theory. In this paper, we study maximum efficiency vs. air gap by Equivalent Circuit and propose simple equations about maximum efficiency of air gaps. The results of these equations are well matched with results from Electromagnetic Field Analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637357.pdf","startPage":"3664","endPage":"3669","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on maximum air-gap and efficiency of Magnetic Resonant Coupling for Wireless Power Transfer using Equivalent Circuit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Air gaps","Couplings","Impedance","Antennas","Equations","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","electromagnetic coupling","electromagnetic fields","equivalent circuits","magnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum air-gap","magnetic resonant coupling","wireless power transfer","equivalent circuit","mobile phone","laptop","coupled mode theory","electromagnetic induction","electromagnetic field analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Study on maximum air-gap and efficiency of Magnetic Resonant Coupling for Wireless Power Transfer using Equivalent Circuit","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637357/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653316","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on maximum air-gap and efficiency of Magnetic Resonant Coupling for Wireless Power Transfer using Equivalent Circuit","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"3664bf026522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064697S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5637360,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department Electrical & Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Zheng Wang","id":"37087071643"},{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Bin Wu","id":"37545877500"},{"name":"Dewei Xu","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Dewei Xu","id":"37087144294"},{"name":"Navid Zargari","affiliation":["Medium Voltage Drive Research and Development, Rockwell Automation, Cambridge, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Navid Zargari","id":"37088094805"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6390-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6391-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5637360","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Stators","Synchronous motors","Voltage control","Permanent magnet motors","Steady-state","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","permanent magnet motors","power convertors","synchronous motor drives","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic capacitor voltage control","high power current source converter","fed permanent magnet synchronous motor drives","LC resonance suppression","fundamental voltage reference","steady-state resonance","transient resonance","low switching frequency","high modulation index"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the dynamic capacitor voltage control (DVC) is proposed, designed and applied to suppress the resonance for the high power current source converter (CSC) fed permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives.

Due to the time variability of vehicular communication channel, it is very significant to study the temporal evolution of channel characterization criteria. We present evaluation results of the temporal evolution of the spectral efficiency from channel sounder measurements of vehicle-to-vehicle MIMO radio channels in the 5.2 GHz band. Our results show that MIMO channels with higher spatial correlation lead to lower ergodic capacity and a reduced signal-to-noise ratio-dependent critical data rate. The temporal evolution of the ergodic capacity and critical data rate shows that the channel with the strongest line of sight (LoS) component also has the highest capacity. We also present a detailed analysis of the environmental factors affecting the capacity pattern throughout the measurement run. Dynamic scatterers introduce capacity bursts instantaneously; the trend stays congruent with the theory.","doi":"10.1109/URSI-EMTS.2010.5637364","publicationTitle":"2010 URSI International Symposium on Electromagnetic Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 URSI International Symposium on Electromagnetic Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610909/5636977/05637364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSI-EMTS.2010.5637364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5636977","startPage":"938","endPage":"941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal evolution of channel capacity in vehicular MIMO channels in the 5 GHz band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temporal evolution of channel capacity in vehicular MIMO channels in the 5 GHz band","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637364/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11660990","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5637364/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal evolution of channel capacity in vehicular MIMO channels in the 5 GHz band","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p938alonso.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058343S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610909","isNumber":"5636977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5636977","articleId":"5637364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5637372,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Several tests are performed to probe the stability of the resulting hybrid system which is the combination of a continuous-time nonlinear topology and a discrete-time linear control scheme.

In our study, the number of input order and boundary learning method are investigated for speedy and correct judgments. Firstly, the size of input images are optimized and principal component analysis is confirmed to be effective for fast inspection with keeping judgment rates. Secondly, we proposed a boundary learning method based on the distance index to select samples in the boundary area in the learning space where the samples are difficult to be judged. And we also achieved cutting down the undeterminable rate and improving correct judgment rate by combination of multiple results obtained with boundary learning methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637457","startPage":"1742","endPage":"1747","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637457.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network visual inspection with boundary learning based on the distance index in input space","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Indexes","Artificial neural networks","Pixel","Principal component analysis","Cameras","Soldering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","electronic products","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","principal component analysis","soldering","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network visual inspection","boundary learning","distance index","input space","automated inspection systems","principal component analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Neural network visual inspection with boundary learning based on the distance index in input space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637457/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653421","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network visual inspection with boundary learning based on the distance index in input space","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1742bf008672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098722S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5637469,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Recently, a highly efficient mid-range wireless power transfer technology using electromagnetic resonance coupling, WiTricity, was proposed. Studies show that the resonant frequencies of the two antennas change according to the air gap in between the antennas. To achieve maximum efficiency using this system, the resonance frequencies of the antennas and the frequency of the system has to be matched. However, when this technology is applied in the MHz range (which allows small sized antennas), the usable frequency is bounded by the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical(ISM) band. Hence a method to fix the resonance frequency within the ISM band is required. In this paper, the possibility of using impedance matching (IM) networks to adjust the resonance frequency of a pair of antennas at a certain distance to 13.56MHz is studied. We studied the electrical characteristics of the antenna with equivalent circuits, electromagnetic analysis and experiments. The equivalent circuits are used as reference to calculate the parameters of the IM circuits. The simulations and experiments shows that the IM circuits can change the resonance frequency to 13.56MHz for different air gaps, thus improving the power transfer efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637484","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637484.pdf","startPage":"2011","endPage":"2016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basic study of improving efficiency of wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance coupling based on impedance matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Basic study of improving efficiency of wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance coupling based on impedance matching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637484/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653440","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basic study of improving efficiency of wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance coupling based on impedance matching","confLoc":"Bari","sourcePdf":"2011bf010626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056528S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5637493,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Lanuzza","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lanuzza","id":"37282897600"},{"name":"Paolo Zicari","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Zicari","id":"37563217700"},{"name":"Fabio Frustaci","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Frustaci","id":"37543009800"},{"name":"Stefania Perri","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Perri","id":"37283398500"},{"name":"Pasquale Corsonello","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Corsonello","id":"37283399400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6390-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6391-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5637493","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Memory management","Random access memory","Circuit faults","Parity check codes","Reliability","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Hamming codes","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-hosting configuration management system","radiation-induced multibit upsets","SRAM","Xilinx FPGA","internal scrubber","compressed Hamming check codes","Xilinx XC2V1000 Virtex-II device","frequency 50 MHz","time 18.76 mus"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637493","abstract":"This paper presents an efficient circuit to mitigate the impact of Radiation-Induced Multi-Bit Upsets in Xilinx FPGAs from Virtex-II on.

RFID tags are placed on the ceiling of the environment and the robot can detect their presence when traveling below them. The detection of the tags is the only information used in our approach (no distance or bearing to the tag is considered available), but differently from similar localization setups reported in the literature, only a small number (about one each m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n or less) of tags is used. Two localization methods are proposed: the first method, computationally fast, is based on Kalman filtering and considers RFID readings as quantized measurements of the robot position; the second method is based on a Particle Filter. Both methods provide a satisfactory performance, with an average position error less than 0.1 m. This result has been achieved resorting to a suitable tag's antenna, expressly designed to obtain regular and stable RFID detection regions. The hardware/software localization setup described in this paper may provide a satisfactory approach in several industrial and domestic scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637523","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637523.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Robot kinematics","Position measurement","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance measurement","Kalman filters","mobile robots","particle filtering (numerical methods)","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot localization","sparse RFID tag","passive RFID tag","global localization problem","odometry","radio frequency identification","Kalman filtering","particle filter","antenna","hardware-software localization setup"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robot localization by sparse and passive RFID tags","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637523/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637523/","accessionNumber":"11653505","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot localization by sparse and passive RFID tags","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1937bf008451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062077S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":5637555,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Sheng-Hong Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jason Sheng-Hong","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37334618500"},{"name":"Chao-Lung Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Lung","lastName":"Wei","id":"37594316000"},{"name":"Shu-Mei Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Mei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155500"},{"name":"Leang-San Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Leang-San","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37270914500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6390-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6391-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5637555","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"abstract":"The universal state-space adaptive observer-based fault diagnosis/estimator and the high-gain property tracker for sampled-data linear slowly time-varying system with unanticipated decay factors in actuators/system states are proposed in this paper.

In this paper, a designing procedure of LCL-filter for APF is introduced, which is aimed for simplified the implementation. To suppress the resonance that may be excited in the system, which brings in stability problems, an active damping control strategy using the current feed-back of the filter capacitor is adopted. By selecting two equal or similar inductances, the filter designing become more simple and effective, meanwhile the capacitance requirement is minimized. A pole-zero automatic cancellation phenomenon is discussed in this paper, which can be applied to simplify the current regulator designing. The tuning method is presented, based on pole-zero mapping.

In spite of the advantages that FPGAs brings to the implementation of digital controllers, this technology remains often deferred by the control engineer. However, software to hardware tools help engineers to overcome the lack of expertise in digital Hw design. In this paper, we present a new design approach of FPGA based controller for electromechanical systems. In the presented solution, a full speed RT motor control drive algorithm is implemented by using hardcore MPSoC (MultiProcessor System on Chip) architecture including specific Hw accelerator. We explore and evaluate the efficiency of using a C-to-FPGA tool flow, ImpulseC, to design a Hw current PI controller coprocessor. Test and validation of this controller system is performed by RT motor emulator implemented on the same FPGA. Advantages of the proposed controller design are discussed through simulation and synthesis results, by comparing to full Sw MPSOC design solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637591.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hw acceleration for FPGA-based drive controllers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Field programmable gate arrays","System-on-a-chip","Hardware","Acceleration","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","motor drives","multiprocessing systems","PI control","power engineering computing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","prototype embedded system","digital controllers","data processing logic","electromechanical systems","motor control drive","MPSoC","Hw accelerator","PI controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hw acceleration for FPGA-based drive controllers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11652983","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hw acceleration for FPGA-based drive controllers","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0196bf020303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060191S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5637598,"authors":[{"name":"Gun Rae Cho","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gun Rae Cho","id":"37087538534"},{"name":"Pyung Hun Chang","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Pyung Hun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37271068900"},{"name":"Yi Jin","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yi Jin","id":"37087315377"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6390-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6391-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5637598","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Feedforward neural networks","Optimization","Frequency control","Frequency measurement","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","phase control","position control","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced feedforward control","nonminimum phase system","tracking predefined trajectory","feedforward controller","optimal zero phase","error tracking controller","stable inversion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637598","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel feedforward controller for non-minimum phase systems by utilizing the preview information of the desired trajectory.

The suggested vision system uses a Time-Of-Flight camera providing accurate 3D measurements of the scene in all illumination conditions. In order to accommodate different installation setups, the system recovers automatically the own 3D position and orientation in the space, according to a floor detection strategy, without human intervention and calibration tools (landmarks, patterns, etc.). The moving people are detected in the 3D points cloud by applying segmentation/tracking methods and metric filtering. The distance of the 3D human centroid from the floor plane is evaluated by using the previously estimated calibration parameters and the corresponding trend is used as feature in a thresholding-based clustering for fall detection. The system shows high performances in terms of efficiency and reliability on a large real dataset of falls acquired in different conditions. The posture recognition is carried out by using both the 3D human centroid distance from the floor plane and the orientation of the body torso estimated by applying a topological approach to the range images. Experimental results on synthetic data validate the soundness of the proposed posture recognition approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automated active vision system for fall detection and posture analysis in Ambient Assisted Living applications","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637786","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637786.pdf","startPage":"2301","endPage":"2306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An automated active vision system for fall detection and posture analysis in Ambient Assisted Living applications","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637786/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653198","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automated active vision system for fall detection and posture analysis in Ambient Assisted Living applications","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"2301bf002984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101626S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5637792,"authors":[{"name":"Parikshit Yadav","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5609073/5635477/5637792/5637792-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christoph Angerer received his Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Vienna University of Technology in 2005, with distinction.

The Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) of the Diesel Generator is not properly modeled in the literature. An accurate model of SFC using cubic spline interpolation method is also presented. Optimization of fuel consumption at various loading conditions has been analyzed with efficient use of load scheduling of the diesel generators. The SFC model consists of discrete and non linear equations and hence conventional method fail to provide optimal solution. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed for the optimum load scheduling of diesel generators of both equal and unequal ratings. A comparison of all the methods is also presented to obtain the probable optimal solution of the problem. It is concluded that proposed SFC model is more accurate and GA gives better results than conventional methods. The proposed schemes can be used in marine power plant design and are equally applicable for any other technology.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637792","startPage":"2292","endPage":"2297","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637792.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of the power generation scheduling in oil-rig platforms using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Gallium","Petroleum","Biological cells","Optimization","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diesel-electric generators","energy consumption","genetic algorithms","interpolation","nonlinear equations","power generation scheduling","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","power generation scheduling","genetic algorithm","diesel generators","oil rig platform","specific fuel consumption","SFC","cubic spline interpolation method","discrete equations","nonlinear equations","load scheduling","marine power plant"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cubic Spline Interpolation","GA","Specific Fuel Consumption","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the power generation scheduling in oil-rig platforms using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637792/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653202","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the power generation scheduling in oil-rig platforms using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"2292bf010332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094858S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5637814,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Experimental results verify that the DPLL with fixed sampling frequency acquires excellent dynamic responses while the one with variable sampling frequency is suitable for digital repetitive control algorithm aiming at enhancing steady-state compensation precision in APFs application.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637816","startPage":"712","endPage":"717","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637816.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of fixed and variable sampling frequency digital PLL for active power filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of fixed and variable sampling frequency digital PLL for active power filters","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637816/","accessionNumber":"11653273","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637816/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of fixed and variable sampling frequency digital PLL for active power filters","confLoc":"Bari","sourcePdf":"0712bf012998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040553S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5637818,"authors":[{"name":"Duy C.

The dynamic PSO is one of the PSO variants, which modifies the acceleration coefficients of the cognitive and social components in the velocity update equation of the PSO as linear time-varying parameters. The acceleration coefficients are varied during the evolution process of the PSO to improve the global search capability of particles in the early stage of the optimization process and direct the global optima at the end stage. The algorithm uses the measurements of the three-phase stator currents, voltages, and the speed of the induction machine as the inputs to the parameter estimator. The experimental results obtained compare the estimated parameters with the induction machine parameters achieved using traditional tests such as the dc, no-load, and locked-rotor tests. There is also a comparison of the solution quality between a genetic algorithm (GA), standard PSO, and dynamic PSO. The results show that the dynamic PSO is better than the standard PSO and GA for parameter estimation of the induction machine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637818/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11653272","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637818/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation of an induction machine using a dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation of an induction machine using a dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1414bf000582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056898S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5637820,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios I.

One such alternative, which has received considerable research interest in recent years, is the implementation of control algorithms on FPGAs. An inherent difficulty of this approach is that it requires expertise in both industrial automation and FPGAs. Also, FPGAs have been traditionally suited towards fast, fixed point calculations. This paper presents an automated methodology which addresses the first problem, by using language translators and hardware behavioral or high-level synthesis. For the second problem, different approaches to support floating point operations at the behavioral domain are thoroughly investigated. Overall, an efficient methodology for design space exploration of industrial control applications is proposed, using FPGA technology. The presented experiments show that design trade-offs can be easily explored and the desired solution for each application can be efficiently selected.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637831","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637831.pdf","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated FPGA implementation methodology of PLC programs with floating point operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637831/","displayDocTitle":"Automated FPGA implementation methodology of PLC programs with floating point operations","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637831/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11653286","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated FPGA implementation methodology of PLC programs with floating point operations","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"3045bf022586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077365S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5637845,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Menotti","affiliation":["Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade Tecnol\u00f3gica Federal do Paran\u00e1, Campo Mour\u00e3o, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Menotti","id":"37592439900"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o M.

LALP is a domain specific language and its compilation framework aims to the direct mapping of algorithms originally described in a high-level language onto FPGAs. In particular, LALP focuses on loop pipelining, a key technique for the design of hardware accelerators. While the language syntax resembles C, it contains certain constructs that allow programmer interventions to enforce or relax data dependences as needed, and so optimize the performance of the generated hardware. We present experimental results showing significant performance gains using this approach, while still keeping the language syntax and semantics close to popular high level software languages, a desirable feature when considering time to market constraints. We believe the performance gains observed for the ADPCM implementation can be extended to other industrial applications relying on algorithms spending most of their execution time on loop structures, such signal and image processing.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637845","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637845.pdf","startPage":"3063","endPage":"3068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"On using LALP to map an audio encoder/decoder on FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11652915","htmlLink":"/document/5637845/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On using LALP to map an audio encoder/decoder on FPGAs","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"3063bf018201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081425S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5637857,"authors":[{"name":"G.

High frequency injection allows, by means of simple mathematical relationships, the estimation of motor characteristic inductances. The machine inductances are characterized by a certain degree of position dependent magnetic saliency, as a function of the shaft position, in particular the mutual inductance value, which is proportional to the error between the true angle and an estimated angle value. The angle error is utilized as error signal, in a phase locked loop technique, in order to track the motor position and speed. The proposed solution has been implemented in a low cost FPGA platform.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637857.pdf","startPage":"3083","endPage":"3088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of a sensorless PMSM drive control algorithm based on algebraic method","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637857","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a sensorless PMSM drive control algorithm based on algebraic method","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11652927","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5637857/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a sensorless PMSM drive control algorithm based on algebraic method","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"3083bf020443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071654S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5637874,"authors":[{"name":"Luis C.

The four-leg inverter is developed to deliver power to three-phase loads under light, heavy, balanced and unbalanced load and source conditions and it can produce three output voltages independently with one additional leg. To predict the voltage behavior for each valid switching state, discrete model of the converter and load is developed. The control method chooses a state with minimum error between the output voltages and their references. The performance of the proposed predictive voltage control scheme is compared with carrier-based PWM method which is an equivalent to the symmetrically aligned-class I 3-D SVPWM. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by MATLAB/Simulink. These results show that the proposed method has good performance and the capacity to compensate disturbances compared to classical methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637875/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11653336","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5637875/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A simple and effective solution for superior performance in two-level four-leg voltage source inverters: Predictive voltage control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple and effective solution for superior performance in two-level four-leg voltage source inverters: Predictive voltage control","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"3127bf012076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077897S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5637881,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Where the voltages are distorted, there is some conflict between power factor improvement, current harmonics mitigation, and cost issues. The Strength Pareto multi objective optimization approach is used to simultaneously optimize a set of different objective functions such as current THD, power factor, distortion factor (DF), K factor, and the filter kVA. The result is a set (not a single point) of optimal results called Pareto Front. Designer can make decision to pick out one of the results which are more suitable considering some other requirements. Using multi objective optimization provides a more comprehensive design scenario giving us much more broaden view to the compensation strategy. The extensive simulation results of the optimization for several objective functions shows the suitability of the presented method.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637900","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637900.pdf","startPage":"3284","endPage":"3291","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization based optimal compensation strategies study for power quality enhancement under distorted voltages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization based optimal compensation strategies study for power quality enhancement under distorted voltages","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11653391","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5637900/","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization based optimal compensation strategies study for power quality enhancement under distorted voltages","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"3284bf012378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091748S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5637934,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan M.

Advantages and disadvantages of both technologies are discussed. Fuzzy systems are relatively easy to design but number of inputs in the system are significantly limited. It is very difficult to design neural networks so rather they have to be trained instead. Neural networks produce much smoother nonlinear mapping than fuzzy systems. When neural networks are selected then researchers are facing two dilemmas: what should be neural network architectures and how to train them. The presentation gives answers for both problems. It was found that Bridged Multilayer Preceptron BMLP are a much better architecture than popular MLP architecture. It is faster to train and more complex problems can be solved with fewer neurons. Training of neural networks is not easy. For example most of the existing software cannot train close to optimal neural network so networks with excessive number of neurons are being used by most researchers. Such networks indeed can be trained to very small errors using training patterns but they are not able to respond correctly for new patterns not used in training. A new NBN learning algorithm is presented in this work. This algorithm is not only up to 1000 times faster than the popular EBP algorithm, but it can train all neural network architectures. More importantly it can train close to optimum neural networks which were not able to be trained before.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609073/5635477/05637934.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2010.5637934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges in applications of computational intelligence in industrial electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5637934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Challenges in applications of computational intelligence in industrial electronics","htmlLink":"/document/5637934/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11653409","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges in applications of computational intelligence in industrial electronics","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0015plenarypaper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044888S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609073","isNumber":"5635477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609073","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5635477","articleId":"5637934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5637974,"authors":[{"name":"Lucian Tutelea","affiliation":["University of Politehnica Timi\u015foara, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian","lastName":"Tutelea","id":"37293944200"},{"name":"Ion Boldea","affiliation":["University of Politehnica Timi\u015foara, Romania"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Boldea","id":"37270081900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6392-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6390-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6391-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5637974","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Genetics","Stator windings","Cost function","Demagnetization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface permanent magnet synchronous motor","optimization design","Hooke Jeeves method","genetic algorithms","mathematical model","equivalent magnetic circuit","magnetic saturation","global cost function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5637974","abstract":"This paper focuses on the optimal design of surface permanent magnet synchronous motors.

The paper describes the implementation of a prototype of the \u03bcDSS APS+ using a standard 0.18\u03bcm CMOS process. As a space application, it is particularly characterized by its low power consumption. The reduction of power consumption is mainly achieved by windowing, which is enabled by a specific active-pixel design in APS. The functions of the blocks in APS+ are tested.

Analog optical links provide a number of desirable features for these applications including inherent bandwidth, immunity to electromagnetic interference, as well as reduced size weight and power. As the number of analog channels grows and link length increases new techniques that provide high-fidelity analog signal transmission are required. Sampled analog optical links which employ a pulsed optical carrier in lieu of the conventional continuous-wave laser offer several unique capabilities. In particular, these links offer time-division (as opposed to wavelength-division) multiplexing capability and immunity to stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) as a result of the broadband nature of the optical carrier. This talk will focus on sampled link operation and will discuss their use in long-haul analog photonic applications such as analog delay-line signal processing where SBS typically limits conventional link performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5638003/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampled analog links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled analog links","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"030ThA2190294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033376S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623517","isNumber":"5636364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623517","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5636364","articleId":"5638003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5638015,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Ta Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of CS&IE, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Ta","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37595343300"},{"name":"Chang-Hsing Lee","affiliation":["Department of CS&IE, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chang-Hsing","lastName":"Lee","id":"37066035300"},{"name":"Chin-Chuan Han","affiliation":["Department of CS&IE, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Chuan","lastName":"Han","id":"37290294700"},{"name":"Ching-Chien Chuang","affiliation":["Department of CS&IE, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chien","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37588022300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8378-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4222-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5638015","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Face","Algorithm design and analysis","Training","Databases","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Laplacian eigenmap","discriminant transformation","facial pose","covariance matrix","dimensional correlation","projection based method","nearest feature line embedding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","covariance matrix","nearest feature point","nearest feature line","Fisher criterion"]}],"abstract":"Many researchers exert to find the best discriminant transformation in eigen spaces to reduce the facial pose, illumination, and expression (PIE) impacts for obtaining the better recognition results.

In this study, a mixture of nearest feature points (NFP) and nearest feature lines (NFL) embedding (called NFM embedding) algorithm is proposed for face recognition. The distance measurement of point to NFP and NFL is embedded into the scatter computation in discriminant analysis. The proposed method is evaluated by several benchmark databases and compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms. From the compared results, the proposed method outperforms the other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.62","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634604/5635543/05638015.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Face Recognition Using Laplacian Eigenmaps and Nearest Feature Mixtures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638015/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Face Recognition Using Laplacian Eigenmaps and Nearest Feature Mixtures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655158","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638015/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Face Recognition Using Laplacian Eigenmaps and Nearest Feature Mixtures","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"4222a220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056935S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634604","isNumber":"5635543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634604","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5635543","articleId":"5638015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5638036,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Omar Derawi","affiliation":["Norwegian Information Security Lab., Gj\u00f8vik University College, Norway, Norway"],"firstName":"Mohammad Omar","lastName":"Derawi","id":"37601674900"},{"name":"Claudia Nickel","affiliation":["Hochschule Darmstadt, University of Applied Sciences (CASED)"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Nickel","id":"37671622800"},{"name":"Patrick Bours","affiliation":["Norwegian Information Security Lab., Gj\u00f8vik University College, Norway, Norway"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Bours","id":"37604820700"},{"name":"Christoph Busch","affiliation":["Norwegian Information Security Lab., Gj\u00f8vik University College, Norway, Norway"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Busch","id":"37368939900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8378-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4222-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5638036","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":179,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":3046},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638036","abstract":"The need for more security on mobile devices is increasing with new functionalities and features made available.

The mobile device was placed at the hip on each volunteer to collect gait data. Preproccesing, cycle detection and recognition-analysis were applied to the acceleration signal.

In optical passive ring resonator gyros, clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CCW) lightwaves are phase-modulated at different frequencies to reduce the backscattering induced noise. The effectiveness of this technique, however, is determined by the carrier suppression level. In this paper, the influence of the carrier suppression level on the gyro performance is examined experimentally for an RMOG system with a silica waveguide resonator. In our experiment, carrier suppression is applied onto both the CW and the CCW lightwaves at the same time to achieve higher total suppression. We show that carrier suppression as high as 100 dB can be achieved by optimizing the amplitude of the phase modulation. A bias stability of 0.46 /s in 50 seconds is demonstrated in an RMOG with a silica waveguide ring resonator having a ring length of 7.9 cm. This is the best result reported to date, to the best of our knowledge, for waveguide-type ring resonator gyros of this size.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2092751","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5672498/05638115.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2092751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5672498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Backscattering Induced Noise by Carrier Suppression in Waveguide-Type Optical Ring Resonator Gyro","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638115/","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Backscattering Induced Noise by Carrier Suppression in Waveguide-Type Optical Ring Resonator Gyro","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"11729622","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638115/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Backscattering Induced Noise by Carrier Suppression in Waveguide-Type Optical Ring Resonator Gyro","sourcePdf":"jlt-he-2092751-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138132S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5672498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5672498","articleId":"5638115","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5638116,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Boh\u00e9mond","affiliation":["Laboratoire RESO, \u00c9cole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Brest (ENIB), European University of Brittany-UBS, Brest, France","\u00c9cole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Brest (ENIB), Laboratoire RESO (EA 3380), Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, France"],"bio":{"p":["Christian Boh\u00e9mond was born in Klayaa, Lebanon.

Such an all-optical mixer is well suited for radio-over-fiber (RoF) applications. The simulation results are based on a SOA model developed under ADS\u2122 software and are compared to experimental results in various cases. The good correlation between experimental and simulation results permits to demonstrate the ability of our SOA model to study mixing phenomenon by using a Harmonic Balance (HB) simulation method.

In prior work (\u201cAuditory Teager energy cepstrum coefficients for robust speech recognition,\u201d D. Dimitriadis, P. Maragos, and A. Potamianos, in Proc. Eurospeech'05, Sep. 2005), a novel feature set called \u201cTeager energy cepstrum coefficients\u201d (TECCs) has been proposed, employing a dense, smooth filterbank and alternative energy computation schemes. TECCs were shown to be more robust to noise and exhibit improved performance compared to the widely used Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). In this paper, we attempt to interpret these results using a combined theoretical and experimental analysis framework. Specifically, we investigate in detail the connection between the filterbank design, i.e., the filter shape and bandwidth, the energy estimation scheme and the automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance under a variety of additive and/or convolutional noise conditions. For this purpose: 1) the performance of filterbanks using triangular, Gabor, and Gammatone filters with various bandwidths and filter positions are examined under different noisy speech recognition tasks, and 2) the squared amplitude and Teager-Kaiser energy operators are compared as two alternative approaches of computing the signal energy. Our end-goal is to understand how to select the most efficient filterbank and energy computation scheme that are maximally robust under both clean and noisy recording conditions. Theoretical and experimental results show that: 1) the filter bandwidth is one of the most important factors affecting speech recognition performance in noise, while the shape of the filter is of secondary importance, and 2) the Teager-Kaiser operator outperforms (on the average and for most noise types) the squared amplitude energy computation scheme for speech recognition in noisy conditions, especially, for large filter bandwidths. Experimental results show that selecting the appropriate filterbank and energy computation scheme can lead to significant error rate reduction over both MFCC and perceptual linear predicion (PLP) features for a variety of speech recognition tasks. A relative error rate reduction of up to ~ 30% for MFCCs and ~ 39% for PLPs is shown for the Aurora-3 Spanish Task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effects of Filterbank Design and Energy Computation on Robust Speech Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2092766","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5772995/05638124.pdf","startPage":"1504","endPage":"1516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2092766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Effects of Filterbank Design and Energy Computation on Robust Speech Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5638124/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12007434","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effects of Filterbank Design and Energy Computation on Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-dimitriadis-2092766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076748S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5772995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5772995","articleId":"5638124","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638125,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Lombard","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5772995/5638125/5638125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anthony Lombard received the M.Sc. degree in optics, microelectronics, and signal processing from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de Physique de Marseille (now Centrale Marseille), Marseille, France, in 2004.

As the ICA signal model inherently accounts for the presence of several sources and multiple sound propagation paths, the ICA criterion offers a theoretically more rigorous framework than conventional techniques based on an idealized single-path and single-source signal model. This leads to algorithms which outperform other localization methods, especially in the presence of multiple simultaneously active sound sources and under adverse conditions, notably in reverberant environments. Three methods are investigated to extract the time difference of arrival (TDOA) information contained in the filters of a two-channel broadband ICA scheme. While for the first, the blind system identification (BSI) approach, the number of sources should be restricted to the number of sensors, the other methods, the averaged directivity pattern (ADP) and composite mapped filter (CMF) approaches can be used even when the number of sources exceeds the number of sensors. To allow fast tracking of moving sources, the ICA algorithm operates in block-wise batch mode, with a proportionate weighting of the natural gradient to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. The TDOA estimation accuracy of the proposed schemes is assessed in highly noisy and reverberant environments for two, three, and four stationary noise sources with speech-weighted spectral envelopes as well as for moving real speech sources.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2092765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5772995/05638125.pdf","startPage":"1490","endPage":"1503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2092765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TDOA Estimation for Multiple Sound Sources in Noisy and Reverberant Environments Using Broadband Independent Component Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638125/","displayDocTitle":"TDOA Estimation for Multiple Sound Sources in Noisy and Reverberant Environments Using Broadband Independent Component Analysis","volume":"19","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12007435","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638125/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TDOA Estimation for Multiple Sound Sources in Noisy and Reverberant Environments Using Broadband Independent Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"tasl-lombard-2092765-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090158S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5772995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5772995","articleId":"5638125","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638127,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Miguel","affiliation":["University of Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5772995/5638127/5638127-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Miguel was born in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1977.

This paper proposes the use of discrete random variables as observations and graphical models to extract the internal dependence structure in the feature vectors. Therefore, speech features are quantized to a small number of levels, in order to obtain a tractable model. These quantized speech features provide a mechanism to increase the robustness against noise uncertainty. In addition, discrete random variables allow the learning of joint statistics of the observation densities. A method to estimate a graphical model with a constrained number of dependencies is shown in this paper, being a special kind of Bayesian network. Experimental results show that by using this modeling, better performance can be obtained compared to standard baseline systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12007437","htmlLink":"/document/5638127/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Networks for Discrete Observation Distributions in Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Networks for Discrete Observation Distributions in Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-miguel-2092764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137124S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5772995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5772995","articleId":"5638127","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638132,"authors":[{"name":"Detlev Marpe","affiliation":["Image & Video Coding group, Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications (Heinrich Hertz Institut), Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5704816/5638132/5638132-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Detlev Marpe (M'00\u2013SM'08) received the Dipl.-Math. degree (with highest honors) from the Technical University of Berlin (TUB), Berlin, Germany, in 1990, and the Dr.-Ing. degree from the University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany, in 2004.","He was a Research Assistant with TUB, University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, and University Hospital Charit\u00e9, Berlin.

The primary goal of this partitioning concept is to provide a high degree of adaptability for both temporal and spatial prediction as well as for the purpose of space-frequency representation of prediction residuals. At the same time, a leaf merging mechanism is included in order to prevent excessive partitioning of a picture into prediction blocks and to reduce the amount of bits for signaling the prediction signal. For fractional-sample motion-compensated prediction, a fixed-point implementation of the maximal-order minimum-support algorithm is presented that uses a combination of infinite impulse response and FIR filtering. Entropy coding utilizes the concept of probability interval partitioning entropy codes that offers new ways for parallelization and enhanced throughput. The presented video coding scheme was submitted to a joint call for proposals of ITU-T Visual Coding Experts Group and ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group and was ranked among the five best performing proposals, both in terms of subjective and objective quality.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2092615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5704816/05638132.pdf","startPage":"1676","endPage":"1687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2092615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5704816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Compression Using Nested Quadtree Structures, Leaf Merging, and Improved Techniques for Motion Representation and Entropy Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638132/","displayDocTitle":"Video Compression Using Nested Quadtree Structures, Leaf Merging, and Improved Techniques for Motion Representation and Entropy Coding","volume":"20","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"12086596","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638132/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Compression Using Nested Quadtree Structures, Leaf Merging, and Improved Techniques for Motion Representation and Entropy Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-marpe-2092615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132901S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5704816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5704816","articleId":"5638132","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638140,"authors":[{"name":"Jagdish Chandra Patra","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jagdish Chandra","lastName":"Patra","id":"37279991800"},{"name":"Pramod Kumar Meher","affiliation":["Department of Embedded Systems, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pramod Kumar","lastName":"Meher","id":"37297872600"},{"name":"Goutam Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan"],"firstName":"Goutam","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37328979200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9662"}],"articleNumber":"5638140","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1370},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ims.org/main/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Robot sensing systems","Training","Artificial neural networks","Temperature sensors","Temperature","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive sensors","intelligent sensors","multilayer perceptrons","pressure sensors","stochastic processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Laguerre neural network","intelligent sensors","wireless sensor networks","inherent sensor nonlinearity","capacitive pressure sensor","multilayer perceptron based sensor model","WSN","temperature 50 degC to 200 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autocompensation","harsh environment","Laguerre neural networks (LaNNs)","linearization","smart sensors","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638140","abstract":"The node of a wireless sensor network (WSN), which contains a sensor module with one or more physical sensors, may be exposed to widely varying environmental conditions, e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. Most of the sensor response characteristics are nonlinear, and in addition to that, other environmental parameters influence the sensor output nonlinearly. Therefore, to obtain accurate information from the sensors, it is important to linearize the sensor response and compensate for the undesirable environmental influences. In this paper, we present an intelligent technique using a novel computationally efficient Laguerre neural network (LaNN) to compensate for the inherent sensor nonlinearity and the environmental influences. Using the example of a capacitive pressure sensor, we have shown through extensive computer simulations that the proposed LaNN-based sensor can provide highly linearized output, such that the maximum full-scale error remains within \u00b1 1.0% over a wide temperature range from -50 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\nC to 200 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\nC for three different types of nonlinear dependences.

First, a new transfer function of the galvanic coupling IBC was derived with the consideration of the internal resistances of the IBC devices. Second, the determination of the corresponding parameters used in the transfer function was discussed in detail. Finally, both the measurements and the simulations of the galvanic coupling IBC along the different signal transmission paths were carried out. Our investigation shows that the mathematical simulation results coincide with the measurement results over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 5 MHz, which indicates that the proposed method offers the significant advantages in the theoretical analysis and the application of the galvanic coupling IBC.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2010.2087870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5725255/05638141.pdf","startPage":"1257","endPage":"1266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2010.2087870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Simulation Method of the Galvanic Coupling Intrabody Communication With Different Signal Transmission Paths","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638141/","displayDocTitle":"The Simulation Method of the Galvanic Coupling Intrabody Communication With Different Signal Transmission Paths","volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11850877","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638141/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Simulation Method of the Galvanic Coupling Intrabody Communication With Different Signal Transmission Paths","sourcePdf":"tim-song-2087870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066524S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5725255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5725255","articleId":"5638141","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638152,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany","Siemens Corporate Technology, Munich, Germany","Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37406908900"},{"name":"Peter Amon","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Amon","id":"37395353200"},{"name":"Andreas Hutter","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Hutter","id":"37273869400"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Kaup","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Kaup","id":"37285096200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5638152","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":892},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638152","abstract":"Scalable video coding (SVC) is a good approach for video services over heterogeneous networks. To achieve efficient video broadcasting systems, a good understanding on the performance of coding tools in SVC is necessary. In this paper, the efficiency of inter-layer prediction tools in SVC extension of H.264/AVC is thoroughly investigated by simulations. First, it is shown that inter-layer prediction is more efficient for fast/complex sequences than for slow/simple scenarios. Second, among the three inter-layer prediction methods, inter-layer residual prediction contributes most gains in simulations suggested by SVC standardization group. Nevertheless, all of them are comparatively less efficient for sequences with many details in the environment of spatial scalability. In addition, medium-grain quality scalability (MGS) outperforms coarse-grain quality scalability (CGS): MGS is able to provide up to 1 dB gain over CGS while keeping an even higher flexibility. However, MGS introduces a relatively large PSNR fluctuation which impacts visual quality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scalability","Static VAr compensators","Encoding","Video coding","Automatic voltage control","Decoding","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable video coding extension","H.264/AVC","video services","heterogeneous networks","video broadcasting systems","coding tools","inter-layer prediction tools","inter-layer residual prediction","SVC standardization group","medium-grain quality scalability","coarse-grain quality scalability","gain 1 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inter-layer prediction","scalable video coding","single layer video coding"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5719058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2082370","startPage":"66","endPage":"74","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5719058/05638152.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2082370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Inter-Layer Prediction in Scalable Video Coding Extension of H.264/AVC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Inter-Layer Prediction in Scalable Video Coding Extension of H.264/AVC","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11833770","publicationDate":"March 2011","volume":"57","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638152/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Inter-Layer Prediction in Scalable Video Coding Extension of H.264/AVC","sourcePdf":"tbc-li-2082370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086612S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5719058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5719058","articleId":"5638152","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5638155,"authors":[{"name":"Dongjun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, AeroSpace, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5639208/5638155/5638155-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongjun Lee (S\u201902\u2013M\u201904) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.S. degree in automation and design from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejon and Seoul, Korea, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, in 2004.","Since 2006, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Assuming each base station is equipped with multiple antennas, we can model this scenario as a multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel. In this paper we consider a coordinated beamforming approach whereby multiple base stations jointly optimize their downlink beamforming vectors in order to simultaneously improve the data rates of a given group of cell edge users. Assuming perfect channel knowledge, we formulate this problem as the maximization of a system utility (which balances user fairness and average user rates), subject to individual power constraints at each base station. We show that, for the single-carrier case and when the number of antennas at each base station is at least two, the optimal coordinated beamforming problem is NP-hard for both the harmonic mean utility and the proportional fairness utility. For general utilities, we propose a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm, which enables each transmitter to update its beamformer locally with limited information exchange and establish its global convergence to a stationary point. We illustrate its effectiveness in computer simulations by using the space matched beamformer as the benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2092772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2092772","startPage":"1142","endPage":"1157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05638157.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Beamforming for MISO Interference Channel: Complexity Analysis and Efficient Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Beamforming for MISO Interference Channel: Complexity Analysis and Efficient Algorithms","volume":"59","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805179","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5638157/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Beamforming for MISO Interference Channel: Complexity Analysis and Efficient Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2092772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16471S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5638157","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5638160,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5638160/5638160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiaheng Wang (S'08\u2013M'10) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2010 and the B.E. and M.S. degrees from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Signal Processing Laboratory, ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

This coexistence is built on the premises that no SU can generate interference higher than some prescribed limits against PUs. The system design based on perfect channel state information (CSI) can easily end up violating the interference limits in a realistic situation where CSI may be imperfect. In this paper, we propose a robust design of CR systems, composed of multiple PUs and multiple noncooperative SUs, in either single-input single-output (SISO) frequency-selective channels or more general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. We formulate the design of the SU network as a noncooperative game, where the SUs compete with each other over the resources made available by the PUs, by maximizing their own information rates subject to the transmit power and robust interference constraints. Following the philosophy of the worst-case robustness, we take explicitly into account the imperfectness of SU-to-PU CSI by adopting proper interference constraints that are robust with respect to the worst channel errors. Relying on the variational inequality theory, we study the existence and uniqueness properties of the Nash equilibria of the resulting robust games, and devise totally asynchronous and distributed algorithms along with their convergency properties. We also propose efficient numerical methods, based on decomposition techniques, to compute the robust transmit strategy for each SU.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2092773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05638160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2092773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MIMO Cognitive Radio Via Game Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust MIMO Cognitive Radio Via Game Theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11805181","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5638160/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MIMO Cognitive Radio Via Game Theory","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2092773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146552S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5638160","onlineDate":"15 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638162,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre of Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Gan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37291760700"},{"name":"Li-Chia Choo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington, UK"],"firstName":"Li-Chia","lastName":"Choo","id":"37601481100"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington, UK"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5638162","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":271,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3444},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Jamming","Array signal processing","Optimization","Security","Interference","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","jamming","optimisation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal cooperative jamming","physical layer security","wiretap fading channel","distributed relay","optimization problem","convex optimization","one-dimensional search","power constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication system security","cooperative systems","relays","wireless communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05638162.pdf","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2092774","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2092774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Cooperative Jamming to Enhance Physical Layer Security Using Relays","abstract":"This correspondence studies cooperative jamming (CJ) to increase the physical layer security of a wiretap fading channel via distributed relays.

This separation of the block structure into three different concepts allows each to be optimized according to its role; the CU is a macroblock-like unit which supports region splitting in a manner similar to a conventional quadtree, the PU supports nonsquare motion partition shapes for motion compensation, while the TU allows the transform size to be defined independently from the PU. Several other coding tools are extended to arbitrary unit size to maintain consistency with the proposed design, e.g., transform size is extended up to 64 \u00d7 64 and intraprediction is designed to support an arbitrary number of angles for variable block sizes. Other novel techniques such as a new noncascading interpolation Alter design allowing arbitrary motion accuracy and a leaky prediction technique using both open-loop and closed-loop predictors are also introduced. The video codec described in this paper was a candidate in the competitive phase of the high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standardization work. Compared to H.264/AVC, it demonstrated bit rate reductions of around 40% based on objective measures and around 60% based on subjective testing with 1080 p sequences.

First, the dielectric losses that occur in a lossy slab backed by a perfect electric conductor are both analytically and numerically investigated. Using similar numerical analysis, the reflectarray element (a patch on top of a slab backed by a conductor) is characterized, based on dielectric losses and reflection behavior. It is observed that for low-loss substrates, the dielectric loss decreases with increasing substrate thickness (as previously suggested in the literature). More importantly, for high-loss substrates, the dielectric loss no longer follows the expected trend (decreasing loss with increasing substrate thickness). The dielectric loss becomes a complex phenomenon, involving the dielectric loss tangent and substrate thickness. It is therefore noted that it is important to recognize the well-behaved and misbehaved phase-swing region for high-loss substrates for a reflectarray element. A simple circuit-model representation is provided for the reflectarray element. The anomalous phase behavior observed for high-loss substrates is explained using pole-zero analysis. Waveguide measurements are performed to quantify these reflectarray losses for low- and high-loss substrates. Finally, the loss mechanisms in a patch reflectarray (scattering mode) are compared to a patch antenna (radiation mode), using parameters such as reflection power and radiation efficiency, and similar loss mechanisms for both structures are apparent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Reflection Characteristics of a Reflectarray Element with Low-Loss and High-Loss Substrates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2010.5638237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5638216/05638237.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2010.5638237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Reflection Characteristics of a Reflectarray Element with Low-Loss and High-Loss Substrates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5638237/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Reflection Characteristics of a Reflectarray Element with Low-Loss and High-Loss Substrates","sourcePdf":"0021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07861S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5638216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5638216","articleId":"5638237","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5638282,"authors":[{"name":"James R.

For the more-centralized transmitter location, simulations predicted an average of 6% less capacity than what was actually measured.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2010.5638282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5638216/05638282.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2010.5638282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measured Multi-User MIMO Capacity in Aircraft","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638282/","displayDocTitle":"Measured Multi-User MIMO Capacity in Aircraft","volume":"52","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641749","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638282/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured Multi-User MIMO Capacity in Aircraft","sourcePdf":"0066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097391S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5638216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5638216","articleId":"5638282","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5638368,"authors":[{"name":"Zahoor Jan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Zahoor","lastName":"Jan","id":"37603620900"},{"name":"Fauzia Jabeen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan","National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences - Lahore Campus, Lahore, PK"],"firstName":"Fauzia","lastName":"Jabeen","id":"37408623700"},{"name":"Arfan Jaffar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Science, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Arfan","lastName":"Jaffar","id":"38558828200"},{"name":"Azhar Rauf","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Azhar","lastName":"Rauf","id":"37602886600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8058-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8057-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8056-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5638368","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Mathematical model","Robustness","Equations","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright","discrete wavelet transforms","genetic algorithms","image coding","message authentication","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital watermarking scheme","genetic programming","Watson perceptual distortion control","electronic document","copyright protection","authentication mechanism","discrete wavelet transform","JPEG2000 image","just noticeable difference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Just Noticeable Difference(JND)","Watson Perceptual Model","Genetic Programming(GP)","Discrete Wavelet Transform"]}],"abstract":"Embedding of the digital watermark in an electronic document proves to be a viable solution for the protection of copyright and for authentication. In this paper we proposed a watermarking scheme based on wavelet transform, genetic programming (GP) and Watson distortion control model for JPEG2000. To select the coefficients for watermark embedding image is first divided into 32\u00d732 blocks. Discrete Wavelet Transform DWT of each block is obtained. Coefficients in LH, HL and HH subbands of each 32\u00d732 block are selected based on the Just Noticeable Difference (JND). Watermark is embedded by carefully chosen watermarking level. Choice of watermarking level is very important. The two important properties robustness and imperceptibility depends on good choice of watermarking level. GP is used to obtain mathematical function representing optimum watermarking level. The proposed scheme is tested and gives a good compromise between the robustness and imperceptibly.","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2010.5638368","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621662/5638364/05638368.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2010.5638368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Watermarking scheme based on wavelet transform, genetic programming and Watson perceptual distortion control model for JPEG2000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638368/","displayDocTitle":"Watermarking scheme based on wavelet transform, genetic programming and Watson perceptual distortion control model for JPEG2000","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654634","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638368/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Watermarking scheme based on wavelet transform, genetic programming and Watson perceptual distortion control model for JPEG2000","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"40128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074837S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621662","isNumber":"5638364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621662","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5638364","articleId":"5638368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5638381,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Riaz Moghal","affiliation":["Mirpur University of Science and Technology, Mirpur, PK"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Riaz Moghal","id":"37424793000"},{"name":"Mubbashar Altaf Khan","affiliation":["Mirpur University of Science and Technology, Mirpur, PK"],"firstName":"Mubbashar","lastName":"Altaf Khan","id":"37594510900"},{"name":"Hassan A Bhatti","affiliation":["Mirpur University of Science and Technology, Mirpur, PK"],"firstName":"Hassan A","lastName":"Bhatti","id":"37585717800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8058-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8057-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8056-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5638381","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Bit error rate","Mathematical model","Equations","Modulation","Quality of service","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","genetic algorithms","quality of service","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum optimization","cognitive radio","elitism","radio spectrum resource","evolutionary genetic algorithm","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","federal communications commission","quality of service","cognitive capability","cognitive re-configurability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum optimization in Cognitive Radios using elitism in genetic algorithms","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2010.5638381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638364","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621662/5638364/05638381.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2010.5638381","startPage":"49","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638381","abstract":"The availability of radio spectrum resource is becoming scarce with advancements in the communication applications. Most of the available spectrum has already been licensed and there would be a time when further developments in the field would be limited due to unavailability of this resource. Cognitive radio (CR) provides for the optimization of the available spectrum. The spectrum licensed is not utilized uniformly by the applications using it, rather the utilization is uneven with spaces that are not being utilized at all. Cognitive Radio identifies the spaces that are not in use at particular instant (empty frequencies) in the already licensed spectrum and reallocates them in order to accommodate new applications (secondary users) that can co-exist with the applications licensed to use that spectrum (primary users). Genetic Algorithms when implemented in the Cognitive Radios can provide for the required optimization in order to accommodate the secondary users in best possible space in the spectrum by interacting with the dynamic radio environment at real time. Elitism is used for selection of the best possible solutions among a pool of solutions. Elitism strives to prevent the loss of the best available solutions so that they make it to the next generation in the evolutionary genetic algorithms. This enables the decision-making process to compare the QoS requested by the secondary user with the sensed radio environment at each generation, to give an optimized solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11654637","htmlLink":"/document/5638381/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum optimization in Cognitive Radios using elitism in genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum optimization in Cognitive Radios using elitism in genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"110254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066888S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621662","isNumber":"5638364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621662","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5638364","articleId":"5638381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5638385,"authors":[{"name":"Jehangir Ashraf Awan","affiliation":["Pakistan Meteorological Department, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Jehangir","lastName":"Ashraf Awan","id":"37088288717"},{"name":"Onaiza Maqbool","affiliation":["Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Onaiza","lastName":"Maqbool","id":"37297566600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8058-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8057-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8056-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5638385","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638385","abstract":"Prediction of monsoon rainfall in a timely manner can be highly beneficial for Pakistan, where monsoon is the major source of rain.

In this paper, we explore the use of Artificial Neural Networks for monsoon rainfall prediction. The techniques investigated include Backpropagation (BP) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). We use 45 years real monsoon rainfall data from 1960 to 2004 for training of neural network models and evaluate the performance of these models over a test period of five years from 2005 to 2009. Comparison with Multiple Linear Regression and Statistical Downscaling Models reveals better performance of neural network techniques in terms of accuracy, and also in terms of greater lead time and fewer required resources.","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2010.5638385","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621662/5638364/05638385.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2010.5638385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks for monsoon rainfall prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Training","Predictive models","Biological neural networks","Biological system modeling","Linear regression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","geographic information systems","neural nets","rain","regression analysis","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","monsoon rainfall prediction","multiple linear regression","backpropagation","learning vector quantization","Pakistan"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Networks","Monsoon Rainfall","Backpropagation","Learning Vector Quantization","Statisitcal Downscaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks for monsoon rainfall prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11654641","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks for monsoon rainfall prediction","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"106129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049305S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621662","isNumber":"5638364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621662","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5638364","articleId":"5638385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5638390,"authors":[{"name":"Sana Ansari","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Iqra University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sana","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37602916100"},{"name":"Imran Shafi","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Iqra University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Imran","lastName":"Shafi","id":"38492400700"},{"name":"Jamil Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Iqra University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Jamil","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37301823300"},{"name":"Syed Ismail Shah","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Iqra University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed","lastName":"Ismail Shah","id":"37297233900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8058-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8057-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8056-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5638390","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638390","abstract":"This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) based approach to diagnose patients infected with hepatotropic virus and the stage of disease.

We propose a combined framework of routing and channel assignment that exploits channel diversity in cognitive radio networks to optimize routing performance and increase the network capacity. Specifically, we propose a joint cross-layer routing/ channel assignment protocol based on AODV that works without any central control channel and accounts for the state of the links. In this paper, we propose to keep a backup channel to cater for channel heterogeneity thereby avoiding end to end re-route procedures. We also propose cooperative channel switching in which various nodes exchange routing and control information in a coordinated way. Simulation results show that our proposed backup channel approach ensures higher connectivity as compared to the single channel approach as the number of channels interfered with increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11654621","htmlLink":"/document/5638455/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Backup channel and cooperative channel switching on-demand routing protocol for multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks (BCCCS)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backup channel and cooperative channel switching on-demand routing protocol for multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks (BCCCS)","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"909192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067778S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621662","isNumber":"5638364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621662","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5638364","articleId":"5638455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5638462,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Irfan","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Irfan","id":"37286374900"},{"name":"Qaiser Habib","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Qaiser","lastName":"Habib","id":"37590458200"},{"name":"Ghulam M.

The mutation operator has been used for achieving convergence. A 2-bit multiplier and 4-bit odd parity generator circuits have been evolved for experimentation and comparison to previous results.

Watermarking is a way to hide secret information in a cover image or host medium. Amount of information to hide in the cover image is limited because there is a trade-off between imperceptibility and payload of the data to hide. So increasing the payload in the cover image while watermark remain imperceptible is a critical aspect in watermarking process and has attracted many researchers in the recent past. In the proposed method both cover and secret images are partitioned into equal size blocks. Then host for each secret image block is intelligently selected through Genetic Algorithm (GA).

At the watermark extraction phase only watermarked image is required from which using Jigsaw Puzzle Solver (JPS) the secret image is reconstructed.

Based on the energy hub concept a broad spectrum of modeling extensions and applications is presented, such as a multiple-energy carrier optimal power flow, risk management and investment analysis tools, agent-based control schemes for decentralized generation units as well as the possibility to analyze the influence of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) on future energy systems.

Lattice reduction (LR)-aided detection techniques have emerged as a low-complexity method to achieve the same diversity as the maximum likelihood detector. In this article we explore efficient hardware realization of the complex Lenstra, Lenstra, Lov\u00e1sz (CLLL) LR algorithm. We accomplish this task by first developing an understanding of the complex relationship between algorithm and hardware considerations. After proposing hardware-motivated algorithm modifications, we apply this understanding to the design of a 4 \u00d7 4 CLLL processor for MIMO detection. Hardware realization results on a Xilinx XC4VLX80-12 FPGA demonstrate that the CLLL processor has a throughput of over 3.5 M channel matrices per second, outperforming previously disclosed hardware realizations. In addition, the algorithm modifications and design procedures that we propose are easily applied to larger MIMO system sizes.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2078670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5739679/05638606.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2078670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice Reduction for MIMO Detection: From Theoretical Analysis to Hardware Realization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638606/","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Reduction for MIMO Detection: From Theoretical Analysis to Hardware Realization","volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11903655","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638606/","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Reduction for MIMO Detection: From Theoretical Analysis to Hardware Realization","sourcePdf":"tcsi-gestner-2078670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145975S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5739679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5739679","articleId":"5638606","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638609,"authors":[{"name":"Rosario Pagano","affiliation":["Broadcom Ltd Irvine, Irvine, CA, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5719221/5638609/5638609-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rosario Pagano (S'02\u2013M'04) was born in Catania, Italy, in 1976.

It was proposed to the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standardization effort of moving picture experts group and video coding experts group, and has been partially adopted into the initial HEVC test model under consideration design. The proposal utilizes a quadtree-based coding structure with support for macroblocks of size 64 \u00d7 64, 32 \u00d7 32, and 16 \u00d7 16 pixels. Entropy coding is performed using a low complexity variable length coding scheme with improved context adaptation compared to the context adaptive variable length coding design in H.264/AVC. The proposal's interpolation and deblocking filter designs improve coding efficiency, yet have low complexity. Finally, intra-picture coding methods have been improved to provide better subjective quality than H.264/AVC. The subjective quality of the proposed codec has been evaluated extensively within the HEVC project, with results indicating that similar visual quality to H.264/AVC High Profile anchors is achieved, measured by mean opinion score, using significantly fewer bits. Coding efficiency improvements are achieved with lower complexity than the H.264/AVC Baseline Profile, particularly suiting the proposal for high resolution, high quality applications in resource-constrained environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5704816/05638615.pdf","startPage":"1688","endPage":"1697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2092613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2092613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5704816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance, Low Complexity Video Coding and the Emerging HEVC Standard","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Transforms","Automatic voltage control","Complexity theory","Interpolation","Video codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy codes","interpolation","quadtrees","variable length codes","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEVC standard","moving picture experts group","video coding experts group","quadtree-based coding structure","entropy coding","low complexity variable length coding scheme","interpolation","deblocking filter design","intrapicture coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H264/AVC","HEVC","standardization","video coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"High Performance, Low Complexity Video Coding and the Emerging HEVC Standard","volume":"20","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5638615/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"12086598","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance, Low Complexity Video Coding and the Emerging HEVC Standard","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-ugur-2092613-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102184S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5704816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5704816","articleId":"5638615","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638621,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Yuan Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5740515/5638621/5638621-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Yuan Yeh was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1971.

Based on this algorithm, Liu developed a centroid type-reduction strategy to carry out type reduction for type-2 fuzzy sets. A type-2 fuzzy set is decomposed into a collection of interval type-2 fuzzy sets by -cuts. Then, the Karnik-Mendel algorithm is called for each interval type-2 fuzzy set iteratively. However, the initialization of the switch point in each application of the Karnik-Mendel algorithm is not a good one. In this paper, we present an improvement to Liu's algorithm. We employ the previously obtained result to construct the starting values in the current application of the Karnik-Mendel algorithm. Convergence in each iteration, except the first one, can then speed up, and type reduction for type-2 fuzzy sets can be carried out faster. The efficiency of the improved algorithm is analyzed mathematically and demonstrated by experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5638621/","accessionNumber":"11903666","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Type-Reduction Algorithm for Type-2 Fuzzy Sets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Type-Reduction Algorithm for Type-2 Fuzzy Sets","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lee-2093148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14552S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5740515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5740515","articleId":"5638621","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5638625,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Latorre","affiliation":["Grupo de Neurocomputaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica, Dpto. de Ingenier\u00eda Inform\u00e1tica, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5680555/5638625/5638625-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roberto Latorre received the B.S. degree in computer engineering and the Ph.D. in computer science and telecommunications from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2000 and 2008, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been a Profesor Asociado with the Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid.

The proposed neural network uses: (1) neural signatures to identify each unit in the network; (2) local discrimination of input information during the processing; and (3) a multicoding mechanism for information propagation regarding the who and the what of the information. The local discrimination implies a distinct processing as a function of the neural signature recognition and a local transient memory. In the context of artificial neural networks none of these mechanisms has been analyzed in detail, and our goal is to demonstrate that they can be used to efficiently solve some specific problems. To illustrate the proposed paradigm, we apply it to the problem of multidimensional sorting, which can take advantage of the local information discrimination. In particular, we compare the results of this new approach with traditional methods to solve jigsaw puzzles and we analyze the situations where the new paradigm improves the performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2060495","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5680555/05638625.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2060495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signature Neural Networks: Definition and Application to Multidimensional Sorting Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Signature Neural Networks: Definition and Application to Multidimensional Sorting Problems","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742256","pubMedId":"21095867","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5638625/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signature Neural Networks: Definition and Application to Multidimensional Sorting Problems","sourcePdf":"tnn-latorre-2060495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15047S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5680555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5680555","articleId":"5638625","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5638628,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Tenti","affiliation":["Electronics at the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5767815/5638628/5638628-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Tenti (F'99) graduated with honors in electrical engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 1975.","He is currently a Professor of electronics in the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.

When operating in the islanded mode, low-voltage smart microgrids can also exhibit considerable variation of amplitude and frequency of the voltage supplied to the loads, thus affecting power quality and network stability. Due to limited power capability in smart microgrids, the voltage distortion can also get worse, affecting measurement accuracy, and possibly causing tripping of protections. In such context, a reconsideration of power theories is required, since they form the basis for supply and load characterization, and accountability. A revision of control techniques for harmonic and reactive compensators is also required, because they operate in a strongly interconnected environment and must perform cooperatively to face system dynamics, ensure power quality, and limit distribution losses. This paper shows that the conservative power theory provides a suitable background to cope with smart microgrids characterization needs, and a platform for the development of cooperative control techniques for distributed switching power processors and static reactive compensators.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05638628.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conservative Power Theory, a Framework to Approach Control and Accountability Issues in Smart Microgrids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Smart grids","Voltage measurement","Artificial neural networks","Power quality","Switches","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","power supply quality","reactive power control","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conservative power theory","smart microgrids","accountability issues","intermittent power sources","power flow","voltage regulation","distribution losses","power quality","network stability","voltage distortion","measurement accuracy","reactive compensators","interconnected environment","cooperative control techniques","distributed switching power processors","static reactive compensators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conservative power theory (CPT)","distributed control","electronic power processors","power measurement","revenue metering","smart microgrids"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Conservative Power Theory, a Framework to Approach Control and Accountability Issues in Smart Microgrids","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5638628/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12004909","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conservative Power Theory, a Framework to Approach Control and Accountability Issues in Smart Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tpel-moralesparedes-2093153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109225S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5638628","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5638633,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Bianchi","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI, Institut Telecom, Telecom-ParisTech, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5638633/5638633-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pascal Bianchi (S'03\u2013A'04\u2013M'04) was born in Nancy, France, in 1977.

In our model, each sensor compresses its observation sequence using a linear precoder and a final decision is taken by a fusion center (FC) based on the compressed information. Two families of precoders are studied: random i.i.d. precoders and orthogonal precoders. We analyse their performance under a regime where both the number of sensors \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n and the number of samples \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n per sensor tend to infinity at the same rate, that is, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n\u2192 \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</i>\n \u2208 [0,1]. Contributions are as follows. 1) Using results from random matrix theory and large Toeplitz matrices, we prove that, when the above families of precoders are used, the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson detector converges exponentially to zero. Closed form expressions of the corresponding error exponents are derived. 2) In particular, we propose a practical orthogonal precoding strategy, the Principal Frequencies Strategy (PFS), which achieves the best error exponent among all orthogonal strategies, and which requires very little signaling overhead between the central processor and the nodes of the network. 3) When the PFS is used, a simplified low-complexity testing procedure can be implemented at the FC. We show that the proposed suboptimal test enjoys the same error exponent as the Neyman-Pearson test, which indicates a similar asymptotic behavior of the performance. We illustrate our findings by numerical experiments on several examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05638633.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2092771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2092771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoders for the Detection of a Gaussian Process in Wireless Sensors Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Gaussian processes","Thermal noise","Detectors","Noise measurement","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","linear codes","orthogonal codes","precoding","random codes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoders","stationary Gaussian process","wireless sensors networks","Neyman-Pearson detection","fusion center","orthogonal precoders","random i.i.d. precoders","random matrix theory","Toeplitz matrices","principal frequencies strategy","signaling overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error exponent","likelihood ratio test","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoders for the Detection of a Gaussian Process in Wireless Sensors Networks","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5638633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11805183","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoders for the Detection of a Gaussian Process in Wireless Sensors Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-bianchi-2092771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111331S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5638633","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5638762,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Guo","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Guo","id":"37595202300"},{"name":"Jianhua Ge","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Ge","id":"37273602800"},{"name":"Haiyang Ding","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Haiyang","lastName":"Ding","id":"37403556000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5638762","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1712},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Error probability","Approximation methods","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Wireless communication","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","approximation theory","error statistics","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol error probability","two way amplify-and-forward relaying","overall outage probability","SEP","OOP","single relay two way AF system","multiple relay two way relaying","closed-form expression","asymptotic approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Outage probability","symbol error probability","two-way relaying"]}],"abstract":"The overall outage probability (OOP) and symbol error probability (SEP) of a two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system are investigated.

Using these expressions, one can evaluate the outage and SEP performance of a two-way relaying system easily and fast.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol Error Probability of Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.01.100983","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5685628/05638762.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.01.100983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","displayDocTitle":"Symbol Error Probability of Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5638762/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11746826","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol Error Probability of Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"022-cl1101-guo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040834S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5685628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5685628","articleId":"5638762","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5638764,"authors":[{"name":"Raed Mesleh","affiliation":["Jacobs University Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Raed","lastName":"Mesleh","id":"37296995700"},{"name":"Hany Elgala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Science, Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Elgala","id":"37396369500"},{"name":"Rashid Mehmood","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Science, Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rashid","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"38186197100"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5638764","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638764","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Optical receivers","Bit error rate","Modulation","MIMO","Optical pulses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical transmitters","pulse modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical spatial modulation","OSM","indoor optical wireless communication","pulsed modulation technique","spatial constellation points","transmit-receive unit alignments","signal to noise ratio","on-off keying","OOK","pulse position modulation","pulse amplitude modulation","PAM","PPM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OWC","MIMO","OSM","OOK","PPM","PAM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.01.101208","endPage":"81","startPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5685628/05638764.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.01.101208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Optical Spatial Modulation with Transmitters-Receivers Alignment","abstract":"This letter proposes significant enhancement in optical spatial modulation (OSM) performance by aligning the transmit and receive units. OSM is a recently proposed pulsed modulation technique for indoor optical wireless (OW) communication . In OSM, multiple transmitters are considered where only one transmitter is active at a time and the others are turned off. The incoming bit sequence activates one of the transmit units, i.e. the transmit units are considered as a spatial constellation points and each unique sequence of incoming bits is mapped to one of the constellation points. It is shown that the proposed transmit-receive unit alignments for OSM enhances the performance by more than 14 dB in signal to noise ratio (SNR). In addition, the resultant scheme is shown to be very efficient in terms of power and bandwidth as compared to on-off keying (OOK), pulse position modulation (PPM), and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638764/","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5638764/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11746835","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Optical Spatial Modulation with Transmitters-Receivers Alignment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Optical Spatial Modulation with Transmitters-Receivers Alignment","sourcePdf":"079-cl1101-mesleh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053987S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5685628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5685628","articleId":"5638764","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5638770,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxian Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongxian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292553600"},{"name":"Yinghui Quan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yinghui","lastName":"Quan","id":"37410102600"},{"name":"Mengdao Xing","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Mengdao","lastName":"Xing","id":"37300837500"},{"name":"Shouhong Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shouhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37277713000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5638770","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":908},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Imaging","Signal resolution","Image resolution","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","radar imaging","signal sampling","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISAR imaging","sparse probing frequency","compressive sampling theory","high-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar","linear programming","greedy pursuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","compressive sampling (CS)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","radar imaging","sparse probing frequency (SPF)"]}],"abstract":"Based on compressive sampling theory, a novel method for high-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging is presented in this letter by transmitting sparse probing frequencies.

Channel estimation is therefore an integral part of the receiver design. Two iterative maximum likelihood (ML) based channel estimation algorithms are proposed for OFDM uplinks in dispersive time-varying channels. The uplink multipath fading channel is modeled such that the channel state can be determined by estimating the unknown channel parameters. A second-order Taylor series expansion is adopted to simplify the channel estimation problem. Based on the system model, an iterative ML-based algorithm is first proposed to estimate the discrete-time channel parameters. The mean square error performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed using a small perturbation technique. Based on a convergence rate analysis, an improved iterative ML channel estimation algorithm is presented using a successive overrelaxation method. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical analyses and show the improvement in convergence rate of the improved algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

An efficient monitoring scheme aims at minimizing not only the hardware cost required for 100% link failure localization, but also the number of redundant alarms and monitors such that the network fault management can be simplified as well. In recent years, several optical layer monitoring schemes were reported for fast and efficient link failure localization, including simple, non-simple monitoring cycle (m-cycle) and monitoring trail (m-trail). Optimal ILP (Integer Linear Program) models and heuristics were also proposed with smart design philosophy on flexibly trading off different objectives.

This paper in particular focuses on newly developed PE infrastructure technologies enabling fast battery charging processes. Depending on the battery and vehicle type, a recharge sufficient for a travel range of more than 100km in less than 10 min is readily achievable. As battery technologies continuously advance, recharging will become available with the speed and simplicity of a today's fuel stop. Two PE converter architectures for recharging infrastructure applications will be presented and discussed based on both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) isolation requirements. Technical evaluation of the two different technologies will be addressed and presented, including a pro- and contra analysis. The impact on the grid is studied by means of simulation with the assumption of a dc fast charging station placed in a rural area in Sweden.","doi":"10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638899","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621661/5638851/05638899.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-fast DC-charge infrastructures for EV-mobility and future smart grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-fast DC-charge infrastructures for EV-mobility and future smart grids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638899/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11662099","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-fast DC-charge infrastructures for EV-mobility and future smart grids","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"2006809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046982S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621661","isNumber":"5638851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621661","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"5638851","articleId":"5638899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5638913,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Therefore, vehicle-to-grid is expected to be one of the key technologies for smart grids integrating renewable energy sources. In this paper, an autonomous distributed vehicle-to-grid control scheme is proposed. Grid-connected electric vehicles contribute frequency regulation and spinning reserve triggered by self-terminal frequency, which is a signal of supply and demand balance in the power grid.

One of the large changes is a transformation of the transportation sector with the use of electricity, with introduction of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). This will pose new challenges and opportunities for the electric distribution companies. This paper analyzes the effects of PEVs charging on the local 400 V and 10 kV electric distribution systems in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, using steady-state power flow analysis. Two different areas representing residential area and commercial area have been simulated for the worst-case scenario, which is simultaneous charging of all the vehicles during the peak load period. The number of PEVs used has been estimated based on the load level at each customer location. The study results have shown that overloading of lines and transformers would occur when simultaneous charging of the vehicles during the peak load period. There would, however, be no problem with the voltage drop at the customer's location during PEVs charging. An iterative method is proposed to estimate the maximum number of possible vehicles charging in the distribution system without resulting in any congestion. This method is also applied when one of the feeders is on outage to ensure the N-1 reliability criterion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Plug-in Electric Vehicles on distribution systems: A real case of Gothenburg","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe)","doi":"10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638947","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621661/5638851/05638947.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638851","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5638947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Plug-in Electric Vehicles on distribution systems: A real case of Gothenburg","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638947/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11662019","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Plug-in Electric Vehicles on distribution systems: A real case of Gothenburg","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"2046565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072168S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621661","isNumber":"5638851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621661","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5638851","articleId":"5638947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5638987,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The method involves an approach of a proper training data selection for a PNN which classifies the operating conditions of a power system with high accuracy. The classification is based on the power system security against critical contingencies that may cause transient instabilities. By the proposed method, high classification performances are attained without requiring large training sets. This work also includes an application of multi-spread PNN structures which provide more flexibility in enhancing the security assessment performance. A simple genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to calculate proper spread parameters of multi-spread PNN structure. The proposed methods are implemented on the Iowa power system model and the results regarding dynamic security assessment performances are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638987","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5621661/5638851/05638987.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic security assessment of a power system based on Probabilistic Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Power system dynamics","Generators","Classification algorithms","Training","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system security","power system transient stability","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system dynamic security assessment","probabilistic neural networks","PNN","power system transient instabilities","genetic algorithm","GA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic security assessment","genetic algorithm","power systems","probabilistic neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5638987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic security assessment of a power system based on Probabilistic Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5638987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11662085","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic security assessment of a power system based on Probabilistic Neural Networks","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"2047331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047293S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5621661","isNumber":"5638851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621661","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5638851","articleId":"5638987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5639010,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5929509/5639010/5639010-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinyi Huang received the PhD degree in computer science (information security) in 2009, from the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, the University of Wollongong, Australia.

To reduce the impacts, many researchers have been trying to find the best discriminant transformation in eigenspaces, either linear or nonlinear, to obtain better recognition results. Various researchers have also designed novel matching algorithms to reduce the PIE effects. In this study, a nearest feature space embedding (called NFS embedding) algorithm is proposed for face recognition. The distance between a point and the nearest feature line (NFL) or the NFS is embedded in the transformation through the discriminant analysis. Three factors, including class separability, neighborhood structure preservation, and NFS measurement, were considered to find the most effective and discriminating transformation in eigenspaces. The proposed method was evaluated by several benchmark databases and compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms. According to the compared results, the proposed method outperformed the other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5751894/05639012.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5751894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Using Nearest Feature Space Embedding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639012/","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Using Nearest Feature Space Embedding","volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11960546","pubMedId":"21079273","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5639012/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Using Nearest Feature Space Embedding","sourcePdf":"ttp2011061073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104431S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5751894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5751894","articleId":"5639012","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5639016,"authors":[{"name":"Ijaz Akhter","affiliation":["LUMS School of Science and Engineering, Lehora University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5770288/5639016/5639016-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ijaz Akhter received the BSc and MSc degrees in physics from the University of the Punjab, Pakistan, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

These bases are object dependent and therefore have to be estimated anew for each video sequence. In contrast, we propose a dual approach to describe the evolving 3D structure in trajectory space by a linear combination of basis trajectories. We describe the dual relationship between the two approaches, showing that they both have equal power for representing 3D structure. We further show that the temporal smoothness in 3D trajectories alone can be used for recovering nonrigid structure from a moving camera. The principal advantage of expressing deforming 3D structure in trajectory space is that we can define an object independent basis. This results in a significant reduction in unknowns and corresponding stability in estimation. We propose the use of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as the object independent basis and empirically demonstrate that it approaches Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for natural motions. We report the performance of the proposed method, quantitatively using motion capture data, and qualitatively on several video sequences exhibiting nonrigid motions, including piecewise rigid motion, partially nonrigid motion (such as a facial expressions), and highly nonrigid motion (such as a person walking or dancing).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and

by blur using deblurring of facial images. The main issue is how to infer a Point Spread Function (PSF) representing the process of blur on faces. Inferring a PSF from a single facial image is an ill-posed problem. Our method uses learned prior information derived from a training set of blurred faces to make the problem more tractable. We construct a feature space such that blurred faces degraded by the same PSF are similar to one another. We learn statistical models that represent prior knowledge of predefined PSF sets in this feature space. A query image of unknown blur is compared with each model and the closest one is selected for PSF inference. The query image is deblurred using the PSF corresponding to that model and is thus ready for recognition. Experiments on a large face database (FERET) artificially degraded by focus or motion blur show that our method substantially improves the recognition performance compared to existing methods. We also demonstrate improved performance on real blurred images on the FRGC 1.0 face database. Furthermore, we show and explain how combining the proposed facial deblur inference with the local phase quantization (LPQ) method can further enhance the performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.203","startPage":"838","endPage":"845","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5715914/05639018.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Deblur Inference Using Subspace Analysis for Recognition of Blurred Faces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Pixel","Training","Frequency domain analysis","Noise","Cameras","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image restoration","inference mechanisms","quantisation (signal)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial deblur inference","subspace analysis","blurred face recognition","facial image deblurring","point spread function","statistical models","query image","local phase quantization method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","inference","point spread function","deblur."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Face","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639018/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Facial Deblur Inference Using Subspace Analysis for Recognition of Blurred Faces","volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5639018/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11832509","pubMedId":"21079280","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial Deblur Inference Using Subspace Analysis for Recognition of Blurred Faces","sourcePdf":"ttp2011040838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080411S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5715914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5715914","articleId":"5639018","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5639023,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, the fixed spectrum assignment policy becomes a bottleneck for more efficient spectrum utilization, under which a great portion of the licensed spectrum is severely under-utilized. The inefficient usage of the limited spectrum resources urges the spectrum regulatory bodies to review their policy and start to seek for innovative communication technology that can exploit the wireless spectrum in a more intelligent and flexible way. The concept of cognitive radio is proposed to address the issue of spectrum efficiency and has been receiving an increasing attention in recent years, since it equips wireless users the capability to optimally adapt their operating parameters according to the interactions with the surrounding radio environment. There have been many significant developments in the past few years on cognitive radios. This paper surveys recent advances in research related to cognitive radios. The fundamentals of cognitive radio technology, architecture of a cognitive radio network and its applications are first introduced. The existing works in spectrum sensing are reviewed, and important issues in dynamic spectrum allocation and sharing are investigated in detail.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2093210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5689326/05639025.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2093210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in cognitive radio networks: A survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Advances in cognitive radio networks: A survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639025/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11759841","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5639025/","volume":"5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in cognitive radio networks: A survey","sourcePdf":"jstsp-wang-2093210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.210334S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5689326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"843","xplore-issue":"5689326","articleId":"5639025","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5639029,"authors":[{"name":"Balakrishnan Varadarajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Balakrishnan","lastName":"Varadarajan","id":"37591888500"},{"name":"Sanjeev Khudanpur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Khudanpur","id":"37284474500"},{"name":"Trac D.

Unlike existing methods, which rely crucially on the near orthogonality of the sampling matrix \u03a6 , our approach makes stepwise optimal updates even when the columns of \u03a6 are not orthogonal. We invoke a block-wise matrix inversion formula to obtain a closed-form expression for the increase (reduction) in the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-norm of the residue obtained by removing (adding) a single element from (to) the presumed support of x . We then use this expression to design a computationally tractable algorithm to search for the nonzero components of x . We show that compared to currently popular sparsity seeking matching pursuit algorithms, each step of the proposed algorithm is locally optimal with respect to the actual objective function. We demonstrate experimentally that the algorithm significantly outperforms conventional techniques in recovering sparse signals whose nonzero values have exponentially decaying magnitudes or are distributed N(0,1) .","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5640365/05639029.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2090143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2090143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stepwise Optimal Subspace Pursuit for Improving Sparse Recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Indexes","Complexity theory","Algorithm design and analysis","Sparse matrices","Approximation algorithms","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","matrix algebra","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stepwise optimal subspace pursuit","sparse recovery","iterative algorithm","sparse signal reconstruction","sampling matrix","block-wise matrix inversion formula","closed-form expression","L2-norm","sparsity seeking matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","greedy algorithms","least squares","signal reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Stepwise Optimal Subspace Pursuit for Improving Sparse Recovery","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5639029/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11670179","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stepwise Optimal Subspace Pursuit for Improving Sparse Recovery","sourcePdf":"lsp-varadarajan-2090143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061892S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5640365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5640365","articleId":"5639029","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5639030,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Ali Mohamed Ali","affiliation":["Laboratory of Analysis and Architecture of Systems (LAAS-CNRS), University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5705613/5639030/5639030-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Ali Mohamed Ali was born in Cairo, Egypt, in January 1981.

Isolation characteristics better than -15 dB with input reflection levels lower than - 12 dB are experimentally validated over 24% frequency bandwidth centered at 12.5 GHz. Measured transmission magnitudes and phases exhibit good dispersive characteristics of 1 dB, around an average value of -6.8 dB, and 10\u00b0 with respect to the theoretical phase values, respectively, over the entire frequency band.

The results show that good agreement between simulation and measurement of slow fading features can be achieved for a reasonable computational effort.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2093498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5705613/05639031.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2093498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and Measurement of Dynamic On-Body Communication Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639031/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and Measurement of Dynamic On-Body Communication Channels","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11804766","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5639031/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and Measurement of Dynamic On-Body Communication Channels","sourcePdf":"tap-gallo-2093498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093142S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5705613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5705613","articleId":"5639031","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5639033,"authors":[{"name":"Avinoam Levy","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5772995/5639033/5639033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Avinoam Levy received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 1999.

In reverberant environment, the direct- arrival of the single source is accompanied by multiple spurious arrivals. Multiple-hypothesis model associated with these arrivals can be used to alleviate the unreliability often attributed to the acoustic source localization problem. Until recently, this multiple- hypothesis approach was only applied to bootstrap-based particle filter schemes. Recently, the extended Kalman particle filter (EPF) scheme which allows for an improved tracking capability was proposed for the localization problem. The EPF scheme utilizes a global extended Kalman filter (EKF) which strongly depends on prior knowledge of the correct hypotheses. Due to this, the extension of the multiple-hypothesis model for this scheme is not trivial. In this paper, the EPF scheme is adapted to the multiple-hypothesis model to track a single acoustic source in reverberant environments. Our work is supported by an extensive experimental study using both simulated data and data recorded in our acoustic lab. Various algorithms and array constellations were evaluated. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in both tracking and switching scenarios. It is further shown that splitting the array into several sub-arrays improves the robustness of the estimated source location.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2093517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2093517","startPage":"1540","endPage":"1555","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5772995/05639033.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Hypothesis Extended Particle Filter for Acoustic Source Localization in Reverberant Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Hypothesis Extended Particle Filter for Acoustic Source Localization in Reverberant Environments","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5639033/","accessionNumber":"12007439","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639033/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Hypothesis Extended Particle Filter for Acoustic Source Localization in Reverberant Environments","sourcePdf":"tasl-gannot-2093517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127133S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5772995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5772995","articleId":"5639033","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5639048,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Van Hoang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5947747/5639048/5639048-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hung Van Hoang received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Information and Communications Engineering.","His research interests include motion control, embedded systems, and real-time applications."]},"firstName":"Hung Van","lastName":"Hoang","id":"37085925726"},{"name":"Jae Wook Jeon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5947747/5639048/5639048-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jae Wook Jeon (S'82\u2013M'84) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1984 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1990.","From 1990 to 1994, he was a Senior Researcher with Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea.

The signals generated by an ME are always disturbed by noises; therefore, these signals are not ideal. The challenge is to achieve the highest resolution and to get the maximum operating speed as well as to use the most cost-effective hardware. To solve this problem, this paper humbly proposes an effective approach, which contains two parts: The main part is \u201ccompensating the noisy signals of MEs\u201d by applying a new proposed method called the advanced adaptive digital phase-locked loop (AADPLL), while the second is a pulse interpolator which generates high-resolution quadrature pulses. The AADPLL algorithm provides a robust filtering characteristic to eliminate the noises and improve the accuracy of the ME's input signals. It also takes advantage of tracking high-speed input signals without time lag, unlike the traditional filters. Additionally, the computation burden is significantly reduced in this algorithm to allow it to be easily implemented in a low-cost processor. The pulse interpolator is based on an existing idea that extracts high-order sinusoids from the original ME signals. However, a new scheme is presented to achieve higher resolution per period with smaller noises affecting the output pulses. Both parts are mainly implemented in a unique hardware platform using a low-cost digital signal processor, such as the TMS320F2812, combined with a small-size field-programmable gate array. This method has already been applied to control a linear motor without using an expensive optical linear encoder. Practical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5947747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2093472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5947747/05639048.pdf","startPage":"3634","endPage":"3646","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2093472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Approach to Correct the Signals and Generate High-Resolution Quadrature Pulses for Magnetic Encoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Approach to Correct the Signals and Generate High-Resolution Quadrature Pulses for Magnetic Encoders","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5639048/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12157713","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Approach to Correct the Signals and Generate High-Resolution Quadrature Pulses for Magnetic Encoders","sourcePdf":"tie-jeon-2093472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073352S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5947747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5947747","articleId":"5639048","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5639049,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos I.

Puncturing techniques are applied to produce different rates for quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with dual-diagonal parity structure. Simulation results show that our selected puncturing scheme only introduces the BER performance degradation of less than 0.2 dB, compared with the dedicated codes for different rates specified in the IEEE 802.16e (WiMax) standard. Subsequently, parallel layered decoding architecture (PLDA) is employed for high-throughput decoder design. While the original PLDA is lack of rate flexibility, the problem is solved gracefully by incorporating the puncturing scheme. As a case study, an RC-LDPC decoder based on the rate-1/2 WiMax LDPC code is implemented in the CMOS 65-nm process. The clock frequency is 1.1 GHz, and the synthesis core area is 1.96 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

Suppose that existing device models (namely, coarse models) cannot match the behavior of a new device (referred to as the fine model). By neural network mapping of the voltage and current signals from the coarse to the fine models, Neuro-SM can modify the behavior of the coarse model to match that of the fine model. However, the efficiency of mapping depends on both the mapping structure and the coarse model. In this paper, a structural optimization technique is presented to achieve optimal combinations of mapping structure and coarse model. An aggressive optimization formulation exploring detailed structural variations in both the mapping and the coarse model is proposed, where the internal branches of coarse models and separate mappings for the voltage and current at gate and drain are used as basic topology variables. The formulation of such a structural optimization by an evolutionary optimization algorithm is proposed. Numerical examples of metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor and high electron-mobility transistor modeling demonstrate that, by using the proposed algorithm, optimal combinations of space mapping and coarse model structures can be achieved leading to the best modeling accuracy with the simplest mapping function.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11821789","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5639068/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Neuro-Space Mapping Technique for Modeling of Nonlinear Microwave Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Neuro-Space Mapping Technique for Modeling of Nonlinear Microwave Devices","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhang-2090169-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111493S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5712899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5712899","articleId":"5639068","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5639069,"authors":[{"name":"Shaowei Liao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5685336/5639069/5639069-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaowei Liao received the B.Sc. degree in electronic and information engineering from the Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, Sichuan, China, in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.","He is also currently a Visiting Student with Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

A set of neural networks is used to represent the EM behavior of the substructure as seen from the interface. This allows EM coupling between substructures to be effectively represented. The method is developed in a finite-element environment. An EM transfer function matrix is formulated to produce training data, allowing neural networks to learn the spatial coupling between EM-field variables at various locations over the interface of the substructure. A new formulation is proposed where trained neural networks are integrated into the finite-element equation for efficient simulation of an overall EM structure. A technique is developed to allow the proposed model to be used with the mesh different from that in neural-network training. Examples show that the proposed method provides better accuracy than conventional neural-network approaches for modeling substructures from an internally decomposed EM problem. Using the proposed model also speeds up finite-element simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2090405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5685336/05639069.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2090405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685336","startPage":"21","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-Network Modeling for 3-D Substructures Based on Spatial EM-Field Coupling in Finite-Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural-Network Modeling for 3-D Substructures Based on Spatial EM-Field Coupling in Finite-Element Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639069/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11733595","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5639069/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-Network Modeling for 3-D Substructures Based on Spatial EM-Field Coupling in Finite-Element Method","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhang-2090405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123573S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5685336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5685336","articleId":"5639069","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5639071,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Matar","affiliation":["Energy Systems Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Matar","id":"37284043500"},{"name":"Reza Iravani","affiliation":["Energy Systems Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Iravani","id":"37275863000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"5639071","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1536},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Hardware","Real time systems","Numerical models","Computational modeling","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","induction motor drives","mathematical analysis","permanent magnet machines","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC machine model","FPGA","real-time simulation","electromagnetic transient","nanosecond range simulation time-step","response time","rotating machine","stator currents","one-time-step delayed interface","numerical stability","mathematical model","permanent-magnet synchronous machine model","induction machine-based AC drive system","field programmable gate array simulator","time 44 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC machines","electromagnetic transients","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","modeling","real-time simulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a generalized, parallel implementation methodology for real-time simulation of ac machine transients in an FPGA-based real-time simulator.

Application of the balancing circuit in the diode-clamped inverter needs proper PWM generation but the modulation method is the same for both in the balanced and unbalanced state. This method of dc-link voltages balance does not need any measurements or additional control, and this ensures fast response and low energy losses. This paper also presents mathematical analysis of the PWM modulation method and the inverter operation, and an analytical description of the natural balancing process with contribution of the load current and the balancing circuit current. Simulations and experimental results of the inverter with FPGA-based control are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the natural balancing process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","RLC circuits","Capacitors","Converters","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","mathematical analysis","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balancing circuit","DC-link voltages balance","single-phase diode-clamped inverter","three-level legs","passive RLC circuit","PWM generation","energy losses","natural balancing process","load current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-link voltage balance","diode-clamped inverter","multilevel systems","natural balancing","neutral-point clamped inverter","neutral-point clamped (NPC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2093477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5979518/05639076.pdf","startPage":"4185","endPage":"4195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2093477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Balancing Circuit for DC-Link Voltages Balance in a Single-Phase Diode-Clamped Inverter With Two Three-Level Legs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of Balancing Circuit for DC-Link Voltages Balance in a Single-Phase Diode-Clamped Inverter With Two Three-Level Legs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639076/","volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5639076/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205709","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Balancing Circuit for DC-Link Voltages Balance in a Single-Phase Diode-Clamped Inverter With Two Three-Level Legs","sourcePdf":"tie-stala-2093477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090912S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5979518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5979518","articleId":"5639076","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5639082,"authors":[{"name":"Kyriaki Fotopoulou","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Central Research and Development, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Kyriaki Fotopoulou was born in Athens, Greece, in December 1981.

For the first time, the effects of coil misalignment and geometry are addressed in a single mathematical expression. In the applications envisaged, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and biomedical implants, the receiving coil is normally significantly smaller than the transmitting coil. Formulas are derived for the magnetic field at the receiving coil when it is laterally and angularly misaligned from the transmitting coil. Incorporating this magnetic field solution with an equivalent circuit for the inductive link allows us to introduce a power transfer formula that combines coil characteristics and misalignment factors. The coil geometries considered are spiral and short solenoid structures which are currently popular in the RFID and biomedical domains. The novel analytical power transfer efficiency expressions introduced in this study allow the optimization of coil geometry for maximum power transfer and misalignment tolerance. The experimental results show close correlation with the theoretical predictions. This analytic technique can be widely applied to inductive wireless power transfer links without the limitations imposed by numerical methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2010.2093534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2010.2093534","startPage":"416","endPage":"430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5697331/05639082.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Power Transfer in Loosely Coupled Links: Coil Misalignment Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Power Transfer in Loosely Coupled Links: Coil Misalignment Model","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11769593","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5639082/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Power Transfer in Loosely Coupled Links: Coil Misalignment Model","sourcePdf":"tmag-fotopoulou-2093534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106839S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5697331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"259","xplore-issue":"5697331","articleId":"5639082","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5639083,"authors":[{"name":"Sathish Ramani","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, US"],"firstName":"Sathish","lastName":"Ramani","id":"37286001600"},{"name":"Jeffrey A.

Edge-preserving and sparsity-based regularization criteria can improve image quality, but they demand computation-intensive nonlinear optimization. In this paper, we present novel methods for regularized MRI reconstruction from undersampled sensitivity encoded data-SENSE-reconstruction-using the augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework for solving large-scale constrained optimization problems. We first formulate regularized SENSE-reconstruction as an unconstrained optimization task and then convert it to a set of (equivalent) constrained problems using variable splitting. We then attack these constrained versions in an AL framework using an alternating minimization method, leading to algorithms that can be implemented easily. The proposed methods are applicable to a general class of regularizers that includes popular edge-preserving (e.g., total-variation) and sparsity-promoting (e.g., -norm of wavelet coefficients) criteria and combinations thereof. Numerical experiments with synthetic and in vivo human data illustrate that the proposed AL algorithms converge faster than both general-purpose optimization algorithms such as nonlinear conjugate gradient (NCG) and state-of-the-art MFISTA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5721862/05639083.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2093536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2093536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5721862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel MR Image Reconstruction Using Augmented Lagrangian Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Humans","Coils","Image reconstruction","Covariance matrix","Optimized production technology","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","image reconstruction","medical image processing","optimisation","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel MR image reconstruction","augmented Lagrangian methods","magnetic resonance imaging","sensitivity encoding","noise effects suppression","aliasing effects suppression","edge preserving based regularization criteria","sparsity based regularization criteria","undersampled sensitivity encoded data","SENSE reconstruction","large scale constrained optimization problems","unconstrained optimization task","equivalent constrained problems","variable splitting","numerical experiments","synthetic human data","in vivo human data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Augmented Lagrangian","image reconstruction","parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","regularization","sensitivity encoding (SENSE)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Brain","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Parallel MR Image Reconstruction Using Augmented Lagrangian Methods","volume":"30","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5639083/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11837874","pubMedId":"21095861","dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel MR Image Reconstruction Using Augmented Lagrangian Methods","sourcePdf":"tmi-ramani-2093536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037573S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"5721862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"157","articleId":"5639083","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5639084,"authors":[{"name":"Shakeel Ahmad","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Shakeel Ahmad received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2000, the M.Sc. degree in information and communication systems from Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany, in 2005, and the Dr. Ing. degree from the University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany, in 2008.","He is currently working as a Research Fellow with the Faculty of Technology, De Montfort University, Leicester, U.K. His research interests include multimedia communication, error-resilient video streaming, peer-to-peer networks, and channel coding."]},"firstName":"Shakeel","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37587326600"},{"name":"Raouf Hamzaoui","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Raouf Hamzaoui (SM'07) received the Master's degree in mathematics from the Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia, in 1986, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 1993, the Dr. rer. nat. degree from the Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany, in 1997, and the Habilitation degree in computer science from the University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany, in 2004.","He was an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany, and with the Department of Computer and Information Science of the University of Konstanz.

The proposed 9L ANPC converter is studied in the case of the grid connection of a 6-MW WT without using passive grid filters in DG systems. Simulation and experiment results are presented to validate the proposed converter topology and control schemes. The proper operation and the compliance to the harmonic limit standards of the filterless grid-connected WT system are verified by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05639088.pdf","startPage":"961","endPage":"972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Nine-Level Active NPC (ANPC) Converter for Grid Connection of Large Wind Turbines for Distributed Generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639088/","displayDocTitle":"A New Nine-Level Active NPC (ANPC) Converter for Grid Connection of Large Wind Turbines for Distributed Generation","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12004910","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5639088/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Nine-Level Active NPC (ANPC) Converter for Grid Connection of Large Wind Turbines for Distributed Generation","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2093154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121215S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5639088","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5639092,"authors":[{"name":"Tom\u00e1s H.

Structurally, for example, it is not yet clear how many distinct horizontal cell (HC) types the primate retina contains and what the exact patterns of connections between photoreceptors (PRs) and HCs consist of. Computationally, it is not yet clear, for instance, what functions are present and how they are being implemented. This paper proposes a model (a linear recurrent neural network defined by 31 parameters) of the outer retina and an optimization methodology that hopes to shed some light on these questions. This paper shows that a simplified model of the outer retina can implement several low-level visual functions involving the modulation of noise, brightness, contrast, saturation, and even color. The results demonstrate that contrast control functions can be implemented with a minimum of two HC types and that spectral specificity between PRs and HCs is a common and important feature. It is also shown that several different spectrally specific patterns can emerge in order to implement the same function. One interesting microcircuit that naturally emerged from our experiments involves nonblurry denoising via interchromatic gap junctions and compensatory resaturation via HC circuits, a strategy that we hypothesize to exist in some biological retinae.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5749780/05639092.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2085432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2085432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5749780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cybernetics of Vision Systems: Toward an Understanding of Putative Functions of the Outer Retina","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Optimization","Visualization","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","optimisation","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cybernetics","vision systems","putative functions","outer retina","horizontal cell types","primate retina","photoreceptors","linear recurrent neural network","optimization methodology","visual functions","contrast control functions","nonblurry denoising","interchromatic gap junctions","compensatory resaturation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cones","contrast enhancement","denoising","horizontal cells (HCs)","image processing","outer retina"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cybernetics of Vision Systems: Toward an Understanding of Putative Functions of the Outer Retina","volume":"41","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5639092/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11944402","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cybernetics of Vision Systems: Toward an Understanding of Putative Functions of the Outer Retina","sourcePdf":"tsmca-maul-2085432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113395S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5749780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5749780","articleId":"5639092","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5639213,"authors":[{"name":"Douglas B.

The system has both automatic gain and peak detection feature. The gain is set automatically dependent on the input amplitude so that at least 13-bit conversion resolution is maintained for the EC signal in the wide range from 48nA to 16mA. Peak detectors (PD) are used to acquire the peak signal accurately and automatically to avoid missing important information in the multi-channel EC detection. The system consists of 16 uniform automatic gain control (AGC) subsystems that operate in parallel. Compared with most of the other AGC systems, the mixed analog/digital implementation presented here operates without ADC sampling and software processing, so that the gain-setting time is minimized to 20ns. For the simple but efficient control mechanism, all digital circuits of the system can be integrated into a small-scale FPGA chip. Compared with commercial EC instrument, these characters make this FP data-acquisition system ideal for in situ or field multi-channel EC measurements.","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639233/05639374.pdf","startPage":"1489","endPage":"1493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639374","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based floating-point data acquisition system with automatic-gain-control and peak-detection for multi-channel electrochemical measurement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based floating-point data acquisition system with automatic-gain-control and peak-detection for multi-channel electrochemical measurement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639374/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5639374/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11662831","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based floating-point data acquisition system with automatic-gain-control and peak-detection for multi-channel electrochemical measurement","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055337S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","xplore-issue":"5639233","articleId":"5639374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5639385,"authors":[{"name":"Yixiang Qi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Polytechnic of Turin, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Yixiang","lastName":"Qi","id":"37598673700"},{"name":"Lin Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Polytechnic of Turin, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wei","id":"37591876200"},{"name":"Haiying Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Haiying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599307800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5639385","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"abstract":"This paper is to analyze and compare the typical two op-amp Instrumentation Amplifier (IA) and three op-amp IA used in bioelectric acquisition system.

based on selected input features for predicting pulmonary embolism (PE). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 102 PE suspicious patient records with demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, blood gas, D-dimer, and wells score. A logistic regression (LR) model was employed to extracted important predictive features, which used as inputs to the BNN model. The BNN was trained and tested using leave-one-out method and then the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was calculated to measure the performance. Results: The variables extracted from logistic regression enabled the BNN model achieved an Az =0.889\u00b10.042 compare to the non-selected BNN model with Az=0.838\u00b10.052. Conclusion: The results indicate that the logistic regression method and the backpropagation neural network, particularly when used in combination, can produce better predictive models than BNN alone. The features such as D-dimer, PO2, and history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE are beneficial for the differential diagnosis of PE. The Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system can help physicians to detect or exclude PE in the clinical practice, and it is a new promising method of diagnosing pulmonary embolism.","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639424","startPage":"2255","endPage":"2260","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639312","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639312/05639424.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network to pulmonary embolism aided diagnosis with a feature selection approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639424/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network to pulmonary embolism aided diagnosis with a feature selection approach","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5639424/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11663194","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network to pulmonary embolism aided diagnosis with a feature selection approach","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079908S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5639312","articleId":"5639424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5639467,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqi Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Huiqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37407160900"},{"name":"Joo Hwee Lim","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Joo Hwee","lastName":"Lim","id":"37276358500"},{"name":"Jiang Liu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405234800"},{"name":"Damon Wing","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Damon","lastName":"Wing","id":"38254246700"},{"name":"Kee Wong","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kee","lastName":"Wong","id":"38253864300"},{"name":"Tien Yin Wong","affiliation":["Singapore Eye Research Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tien Yin","lastName":"Wong","id":"37406146500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5639467","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"abstract":"Nuclear cataract is the most common type of age-related cataract and it is clinically diagnosed using slit-lamp images.

Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is one of the most popular feature extraction techniques due to its representation method being very similar to the human auditory system. The MFCC method for feature extraction depends on several important parameter settings, namely the number of filter banks, and the number of coefficients used in the final representation. These settings affects the way the features are represented, and in turn, affects the performance of the classifier for diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimise the parameters of the MFCC feature extraction method for classifying infants with asphyxia. The extracted MFCC features were then used to train several MLP classifiers over different initialization values. The accuracy of these classifiers was then used to guide the PSO optimization. Our results show that the optimization of MFCC computation using PSO yielded 93.9% accuracy, an improvement of 1.45% over typical MFCC parameter settings using the same classifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639674/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11662725","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5639674/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimisation of Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients computation for the classification of asphyxiated infant cry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimisation of Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients computation for the classification of asphyxiated infant cry","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104366S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5639235","articleId":"5639674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5639731,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxia Guo","affiliation":["Preps Department of Engineering College, The Peoples Armed Police Forces Academy, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongxia","lastName":"Guo","id":"37595199000"},{"name":"Binghe Wang","affiliation":["Communication Department of Engineering College, The Peoples Armed Police Forces Academy, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Binghe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599815200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5639731","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Accuracy","Training","Pattern recognition","Noise","Medical diagnostic imaging","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","medical computing","medicine","neural nets","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TCM pulse condition identification","probabilistic neural networks","Xi'an TCM Hospital","noise circumstances","traditional Chinese medicine","traditional fuzzy cluster method","pulse diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pulse condition","pattern recognition","probabilistic neural networks (PNN)","back propagation (BP) neural networks","Bayes minimal risk criterion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639731","abstract":"The key of objectivity of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) pulse condition lies on the objective test and correct recognition for all kinds of pulse conditions. In view of the ambiguity, variety and complexity of TCM pulse conditions, and the shortcomings of the traditional recognition methods and back propagation (BP) neural network method, a kind of TCM pulse-condition recognition method based on probabilistic neural networks (PNN) is put forward. In this research three experienced practitioners of Xi'an TCM Hospital gave us their expert advice and determined the percentage of correct recognition of our PNN method. For the twelve kinds of TCM pulse conditions, we attained an average recognition accuracy of about 93% with PNN method, better than the average recognition accuracy of about 75% attained with the traditional fuzzy cluster method and 87.1% with BP neural network method. The contrastive experiments of the BP neural network method and the PNN method are given. The results show that recognition accuracy of PNN method is out and away higher than that of BP neural network method in high noise circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639731","startPage":"2352","endPage":"2355","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639312","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639312/05639731.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on TCM pulse condition identification using probabilistic neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639731/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Research on TCM pulse condition identification using probabilistic neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5639731/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11663116","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on TCM pulse condition identification using probabilistic neural networks","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053061S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5639312","articleId":"5639731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5639829,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Guo","affiliation":["School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37605445700"},{"name":"Xuezhi Wang","affiliation":["School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuezhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601043600"},{"name":"Yingshi Han","affiliation":["School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yingshi","lastName":"Han","id":"37600350900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5639829","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Gallium","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetics","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization design","interval genetic algorithm","hybrid interval genetic algorithm","interval analysis","optimum interval range","interval optimization process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optimization","genetic algorithms","hybrid genetic algorithm","interval genetic algorithm","hybrid interval genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639829","abstract":"Three different kinds of the novel enhanced genetic algorithm procedures including the hybrid genetic algorithm, interval genetic algorithm and hybrid interval genetic algorithm are respectively presented.

Feature extraction is an important task that significantly affects the classification results. First, the discrete wavelet transform was applied to ECoG signals from one subject performing imagined movements of either the left small-finger or the tongue. After preprocessing, relative wavelet energy of selected 8 channels were extracted and built 40 dimension feature vector. Then the dimension of feature vector was reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, probabilistic neural network (PNN) was used to classify. The average classification accuracy rate reached a maximum of 91.8% when spread of radial basis functions was 0.11. The offline analysis results showed that ECoG signals could be used in BCI design, and gave new ideas and methods for feature extraction and classification of imaginary movements in ECoG-based BCI research.","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639897","startPage":"873","endPage":"877","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639231","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639231/05639897.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECoG-based brain-computer interface using relative wavelet energy and probabilistic neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639897/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ECoG-based brain-computer interface using relative wavelet energy and probabilistic neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5639897/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11662670","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECoG-based brain-computer interface using relative wavelet energy and probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093038S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5639231","articleId":"5639897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5639958,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoyuki Hiroyasu","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Hiroyasu","id":"37280858300"},{"name":"Yuusuke Yoneda","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuusuke","lastName":"Yoneda","id":"37603321200"},{"name":"Misato Tanaka","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Misato","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37597812300"},{"name":"Yasunari Sasaki","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunari","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"37593020200"},{"name":"Hisatake Yokouchi","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisatake","lastName":"Yokouchi","id":"37603466900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5639958","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639958","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Humans","Image color analysis","Shape","Optimization","Intelligent systems","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","user interfaces","vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["button arrangement effects","interactive genetic algorithms","visual interface systems","gazing","human subjective evaluation","iGA search"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639958","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639239/05639958.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of button arrangement on evaluations in interactive Genetic Algorithms","abstract":"We discussed the effects of button arrangement on evaluations in interactive Genetic Algorithms (iGAs). It was reported that the visual interface effects human's subjective. The visual interface systems of iGAs may affect the solutions as humans evaluate the candidate solutions, evaluation of these candidates may be affected by the interface. In this paper, we conduct the two experiments. One of them is the experiment to verify the association between gazing and evaluation. The experiment showed that visual interface systems effects to the evaluation of human subjective. This means that evaluation value is changed according to visual interface or locations of systems. The other is the experiment to discuss the effect to iGA search. Since visual interface affects evaluation values, derived solution by iGA is different with along to the different visual interface. From these results, visual interface of iGA should be designed carefully to use the positive or negative effect of interface design and location.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639958/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11663056","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5639958/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The effects of button arrangement on evaluations in interactive Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of button arrangement on evaluations in interactive Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.177899S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","xplore-issue":"5639239","articleId":"5639958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5639975,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37898291600"},{"name":"Wen-xin Liang","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wen-xin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37598508200"},{"name":"Hao-jie Li","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Hao-jie","lastName":"Li","id":"37067567700"},{"name":"Zong-ying Ou","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zong-ying","lastName":"Ou","id":"37265354100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5639975","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Head","Fitting","Prosthetics","Three dimensional displays","Ellipsoids","Surface fitting","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anthropometry","bone","diseases","patient treatment","physiological models","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["individualized prosthetic modeling","individualized morphological analysis","femoral head prosthesis","acetabulum","operative treatment","total hip replacement","subsided femoral head shape reconstruction","ischemic necrosis","contrastive simulation","prosthetic models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rehabilitation engineering","reverse technology","individualized prosthetic modeling","morphological analysis"]}],"abstract":"The matching quality between the femoral head prosthesis and the acetabulum plays an important role in the operative treatment with femoral head prosthetics and total hip replacement. For the sake of getting the optimal femoral head prosthesis model of the target sufferer, a novel modeling method is proposed. It can reconstruct the shape of the subsided femoral head owing to ischemic necrosis. In this paper, two male sufferers with different necrosis extent were chosen as the experimental subject for contrastive simulation. The prosthetic models highly presented the primary shape of the femoral heads. The spatial dynamic analysis between the prosthesis models and the acetabulum was implemented. The results proved that the fitted models primely matched with the acetabulum.","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639975","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639239/05639975.pdf","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5639975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Individualized prosthetic modeling and morphological analysis of the femoral head","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5639975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5639975/","displayDocTitle":"Individualized prosthetic modeling and morphological analysis of the femoral head","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11663070","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5639975/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Individualized prosthetic modeling and morphological analysis of the femoral head","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108264S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","xplore-issue":"5639239","articleId":"5639975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
