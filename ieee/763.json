Conventionally, correlative precoder has been proposed and widely considered to be effective in ICI self-cancellation. However, correlatively precoded OFDM waveforms entail increased peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). To overcome this shortcoming, a new form of circulant precoders is designed in the paper to endow circulantly precoded OFDM waveforms with enhanced ICI self-cancellation while retaining reduced PAPR. Simulation results show that circulantly precoded OFDM can achieve better ICI self-cancellation and PAPR reduction jointly.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636715","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636715.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circulantly precoded OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636715/","displayDocTitle":"Circulantly precoded OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410265","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636715/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circulantly precoded OFDM","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570252564wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09311S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636716,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Hsun Ma","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Hsun","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085878439"},{"name":"Yen-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085878432"},{"name":"Char-Dir Chung","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Char-Dir","lastName":"Chung","id":"37085500932"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636716","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Array signal processing","Receivers","Interpolation","Transmitting antennas","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel capacity","computational complexity","interpolation","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit beamforming","multiple-input single-output systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","MISO-OFDM systems","optimal subcarrier-wise beamforming scheme","subcarrier information","nonreciprocal channels","subband beamforming scheme","channel capacity","interpolation beamforming scheme","subband grouping","feedback overhead","computation complexity","beamforming coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input single-output","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel","beamforming","capacity"]}],"abstract":"Transmit beamforming is effective in the performance enhancement of multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MISO-OFDM) systems.

However, when joint coding among all subcarriers is considered during the multiple-access (MAC) phase, the complicated multi-user detection (MUD) operation at the relay node has to be performed to approach the rate region. In this paper, the frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) constraint is involved to simplify the MUD operation, while the corresponding optimal power allocation for achievable rate region is not convex any more. Then a duality-based proximal optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this non-convex problem efficiently. Simulation results show that our simplified scheme with the FDMA constraint has only a little rate loss compared with the original optimal one, while obtaining even a minor sum rate improvement than the scheme in [6]. Therefore, by our FDMA-constraint low complexity power allocation scheme, a good tradeoff between the complexity and performance for the practical system implementation is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636718","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636718.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity power allocation for two-way decode-and-forward OFDM relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636718/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity power allocation for two-way decode-and-forward OFDM relay networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410362","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636718/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity power allocation for two-way decode-and-forward OFDM relay networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570260221he.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083773S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636719,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Sun","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085872693"},{"name":"Kui Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Xu","id":"38236981000"},{"name":"Wei Xie","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37398811400"},{"name":"Xu Han","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Han","id":"37085882060"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277724400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636719","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Fading channels","Array signal processing","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","diversity reception","energy conservation","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipair two-way massive MIMO AF relaying","MRC-MRT","spectral efficiencies","energy efficiencies","multipair two-way amplify-and-forward relay system","Ricean fading channels","multiple user-pairs","information exchange","beamforming matrix","maximum ratio combining","maximum ratio transmission","imperfect channel state information","imperfect CSI","unified asymptotic SINR","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","power scaling","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Ricean fading channels","Spectral and Energy Efficiencies","Imperfect CSI"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the spectral and energy efficiencies of a multi-pair two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system over Ricean fading channels, where multiple user-pairs exchange information within pair through a relay with very large number of antennas, while each user equipped with a single antenna.

We propose a lattice-precoding based nested lattice coding scheme for the considered MIMO mRC, and derive the achievable rates of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme is generally applicable to MIMO mRCs with an arbitrary number of users. Particularly, we show that the proposed scheme achieves the asymptotic capacity of the MIMO mRC with two users (i.e., the MIMO two-way relay channel), as the signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity. We also show that, for a general MIMO mRC, the proposed scheme achieves the capacity of the downlink, and performs close to the cut-set bound of the uplink.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636725","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636725.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice precoding for MIMO multiway relay channel with full data exchange","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636725/","displayDocTitle":"Lattice precoding for MIMO multiway relay channel with full data exchange","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410279","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636725/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice precoding for MIMO multiway relay channel with full data exchange","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570263042yuan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094684S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636727,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Song","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Song","id":"37085882730"},{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab of EDA, Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China","School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085568255"},{"name":"Liangliang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liangliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085644273"},{"name":"Xuming Lu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuming","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085882759"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636727","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":507},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Convergence","Jacobian matrices","MIMO","Precoding","Proposals","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","error statistics","Jacobian matrices","matrix inversion","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multiple-input multiple-output downlink systems","massive MIMO downlink systems","computational complexity","precoding","approximate matrix inversion algorithms","series expansion","joint conjugate gradient method","Jacobi iteration method","convergence rate","bit error rate performance","BER performance","searching direction","nonjoint iteration methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","joint conjugate gradient and Jacobi iteration algorithm","matrix inversion"]}],"abstract":"In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink systems, the computational complexity of the matrix inversion for precoding is becoming a bottleneck for the system implementation, along with the increased antenna dimension at the base station and the number of served users. By traditional approximate matrix inversion algorithms, for example, series expansion, gradient or iteration methods, the proper system performance can be achieved by lower complexity for each recursive expansion or iteration, while keeping lower convergence rate. In this paper, a novel joint conjugate gradient (CG) and Jacobi (JC) iteration method is proposed to speed up the convergence rate as well as guaranteeing the bit error rate (BER) performance. In this proposal, the CG is firstly used twice to find a more accurate searching direction for the following low complexity JC iterations. Numerical simulations and complexity analysis show that, with lower computational complexity, our proposal can obviously outperform previous nonjoint iteration methods. Even compared with recently proposed joint steepest descent and Jacobi method in [7], our proposal can obtain the similar or even better BER performance with faster convergence rate, which indicates lower total hardware implementation complexity and latency.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636727","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636727.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint conjugate gradient and Jacobi iteration based low complexity precoding for massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint conjugate gradient and Jacobi iteration based low complexity precoding for massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636727/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410240","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636727/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint conjugate gradient and Jacobi iteration based low complexity precoding for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570264022song.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049941S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636728,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ziyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085883587"},{"name":"Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291849800"},{"name":"Fan Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085883202"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085774053"},{"name":"Xiuqiang Xu","affiliation":["Department of 2012 Laboratory, Huawei Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiuqiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"38667393500"},{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of 2012 Laboratory, Huawei Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293321600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636728","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1067},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Uplink","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Complexity theory","Channel capacity","Optimization","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","codes","Gaussian processes","message passing","multi-access systems","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint codebook assignment","Gaussian input","sparse code multiple access","uplink SCMA sum capacity","nonorthogonal multidimensional spreading technique","multidimensional codewords","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM symbols","low density signature","LDS","shaping gain","multidimensional constellation","message passing algorithm","MPA receiver","codebook design method","uplink sum-rate optimization problem","power allocation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCMA","capacity","shaping gain","codebook","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) is a non-orthogonal multi-dimensional spreading technique based on layered codebooks.

However, the related resource division multiplexing technique has not been well studied. Referring to the development of TDMA and FDMA, they are all based on the fundamental studies of time division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM), respectively. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new multiplexing technique, termed as power division multiplexing (PDM), to support the power division based MAC protocol which the NOMA belongs to. In PDM, we consider the transmit power is divided into multiple power segments (PSs) similar to the time-slots/sub-bands in TDM/FDM. The multiple PSs are used to concurrently deliver different informations in a same channel. By analysis, we prove that PDM outperforms TDM and FDM with regard to QoS requirement. Thus, the proposed PDM has potentials for the future cellular network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power division multiplexing","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636729","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Power division multiplexing","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636729/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410334","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power division multiplexing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570264151han.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092273S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636730,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Qian","affiliation":["Tsinehua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085782998"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Tsinehua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085497446"},{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gongpu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404549100"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636730","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636730","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Backscatter","RF signals","Bit error rate","Probability density function","Wireless communication","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","error statistics","radiocommunication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ambient backscatter system performance analysis","symbol detection","ambient radiofrequency signal","power source","closed-form bit error rate","suboptimal detector","BER expression"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636730","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636730.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol detection and performance analysis of the ambient backscatter system","abstract":"In this paper, we mainly study the symbol detection of the ambient backscatter, a novel communication mechanism that utilizes ambient radio frequency signals as both the power source and the symbol carrier to enable communications between devices.

Using the relay enhances cell-edge user received signal strength by short-distance communication in low transmit power. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), a promising spectral efficient technology for the 5-th generation network (5G), enables the relay to transmit multiple messages to cell-edge users concurrently. In this paper, a Collaborative NOMA Assisted Relaying (CNAR) system for 5G is proposed with the collaboration of the source-relay (S-R) and relay-destination (R-D) NOMA link. The relay decodes its own message from the S-R NOMA signal and transmits the remaining part with adjusted power to cell-edge users in the R-D link. Then the exact expression of system outage probability is derived by analyzing the outage behavior in S-R and R-D links separately. To guarantee the data rate, the optimal power allocation among NOMA users is provided by minimizing the outage probability. To further characterize the system performance, the ergodic sum capacity in high SNR regime is approximated from discussions on the interference at cell-edge users. Simulation results validate our mathematical analysis, and show that the relaying system assisted by NOMA achieves lower outage probability and higher sum capacity than orthogonal multiple access (OMA).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636773/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16410295","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636773/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Outage probability and capacity analysis of the collaborative NOMA assisted relaying system in 5G","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probability and capacity analysis of the collaborative NOMA assisted relaying system in 5G","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570264336liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052009S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7636774,"authors":[{"name":"Xiumin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiumin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066311000"},{"name":"Yang Sui","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Sui","id":"37085879347"},{"name":"Chau Yuen","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chau","lastName":"Yuen","id":"37273147100"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403981600"},{"name":"Chenguang Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chenguang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085876031"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636774","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Cloud computing","Mobile communication","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Dynamic programming","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bin packing","cloud computing","cooperative communication","dynamic programming","mobile computing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic-aware task allocation","cooperative execution","mobile cloud computing","mobile device","data-dependency task","dynamic programming","bin packing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile cloud computing","task allocation","chain structure","dynamic programming"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative application execution among mobile devices has recently received significant attention in mobile cloud computing. However, it may incur extra traffic among devices, e.g., exchanging the results of the tasks, especially for data-dependency tasks. In this paper, we focus on the task execution in a chain structure, where each task must be executed based on the output result of its precedent task in the chain. We design task allocation schemes to the mobile devices such that the total traffic incurred during task execution is minimum, while the constraint of the resources on mobile device is not violated. Based on that, we also aim to minimize the total number of mobile devices participated in task execution. A dynamic programming and a bin packing algorithm are proposed to complete the above two objectives respectively. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in reducing the traffic and the number of required mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636774","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-aware task allocation for cooperative execution in mobile cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-aware task allocation for cooperative execution in mobile cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636774/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410332","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636774/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-aware task allocation for cooperative execution in mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570264342wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082886S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636775,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Hu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085610534"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37407136200"},{"name":"Xiangyun Zhou","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406420900"},{"name":"Weiwei Yang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290575300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636775","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636775","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Array signal processing","Training","Transmitters","Fading channels","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","fading channels","frequency division multiplexing","receivers","telecommunication security","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure beamforming transmission","quasi-static block fading channel","multi-antenna transmitter","single-antenna receiver","passive single-antenna eavesdropper","statistical channel knowledge","partial channel knowledge","signaling overhead","outage events","wiretap code parameters","positive secrecy rate","on-off-based transmission scheme","secrecy throughput performance","physical layer security","frequency division duplex systems","FDD systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secure beamforming","on-off transmission","limited training and feedback overhead"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636775","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636775.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure beamforming transmission with limited training and feedback","abstract":"We consider the secure beamforming transmission over a quasi-static block fading channel from a multi-antenna transmitter to a desired single-antenna receiver, in the presence of a passive single-antenna eavesdropper.

To keep control of the outage events caused by the limited channel knowledge, We firstly propose a strategy to determine the wiretap code parameters under the outage constraints, based on which we establish a necessary transmission condition to guarantee a positive secrecy rate.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-user computation offloading for mobile cloud computing under dynamic environment, wherein mobile users may become active or inactive (i.e., silent) dynamically, and the wireless channels for users to offload computation vary randomly. Taking into account the mutual interference among different users when offloading computation to mobile could via wireless channels, we formulate the mobile users' offloading decision process as a stochastic game. We further prove that the formulated stochastic game is equivalent to a potential game which has at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE). At the NE, no single user will unilaterally change its computation offloading strategy. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent stochastic learning algorithm to reach the NE with guaranteed convergence. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and evaluate its performance under dynamic environment.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636777","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636777.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic computation offloading game for mobile cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic computation offloading game for mobile cloud computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636777/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410283","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic computation offloading game for mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570264429zheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069581S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636778,"authors":[{"name":"Meixiang Zhang","affiliation":["Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Meixiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240488900"},{"name":"Chunxiao Li","affiliation":["Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chunxiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085654961"},{"name":"Sooyoung Kim","affiliation":["Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Sooyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279282600"},{"name":"Saleem Ahmed","affiliation":["Dawood University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Saleem","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38581275600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636778","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636778","abstract":"The iterative detection and decoding technique based on parallel interference cancellation (PIC) has received considerable attention.

In this paper, we aim to optimize the power consumption of downlink multi-user small-cell networks (SCNs) taking the quality of service (QoS) requirements of all the users into account. First we use semi-definite relaxation technique to transform the power consumption optimization problem into a convex problem, then obtain the optimal solution and insights on the interplay of the design parameters like the number of users, the number of antennas and the QoS value by using toolbox CVX. Simulation results show that our optimization is effective. Moreover, we show that the power consumption can be further reduced by applying antenna selection algorithm when the number of antennas is larger than the number of users per small-cell access point.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636789/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410339","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power consumption optimization for small-cell networks under QoS constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power consumption optimization for small-cell networks under QoS constraints","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570264587wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063688S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7636793,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Machuzak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Machuzak","id":"37085879254"},{"name":"Sudharman K.

The proposed anti-jamming scheme is aimed at evading a jammer that sweeps across the whole wideband spectrum range in which the WACR is expected to operate. The WACR makes use of its spectrum knowledge acquisition ability to detect and identify the location of the sweeping jammer. This information and reinforcement learning is then used to learn the optimal communications mode to avoid the jammer. In this paper, we discuss a specific reinforcement learning mechanism based on Q-learning to successfully learn such an anti-jamming operation over a several hundred mega-Hz of wide spectrum in realtime. We describe a cognitive anti-jamming communications protocol that selects a spectrum position with enough contiguous idle spectrum uninterfered by both deliberate jammers and inadvertent interferers and transmits till the jammer catches up to it. When the jammer interferes with the cognitive radio's transmission, it switches to a new spectrum band that will lead to the longest possible uninterrupted transmission as learned through Q-learning. We present results of an implementation of the proposed WACR for cognitive anti-jamming and discuss its effectiveness in learning the surrounding RF environment to avoid both deliberate jamming and unintentional interference.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636793","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China

over the next decade and the explosion of new services and applications, such as the internet of things (IoT), pose great challenges for the current 4G mobile network. Pattern division multiple access (PDMA), as a novel non-orthogonal multiple access scheme, has been proposed recently to address these challenges. The performance of PDMA uplink system mainly depends on the receiver algorithm. The conventional message pass algorithm (MPA) cannot fully exploit the benefits of the coded PDMA system. In this paper, we devise an advanced receiver via iterative detection and decoding (IDD) algorithm which fully exploits coding potentials and diversity gains of the PDMA. The simulation results show that IDD based advanced receiver obtains a performance improvement about 1.6 dB at block error rate (BLER) of 0.01 for 300% overload compared with the MPA based approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636794/","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410281","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Advanced IDD receiver for PDMA uplink system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced IDD receiver for PDMA uplink system","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570264949ren.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056399S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636795,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xiong","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37085690211"},{"name":"Zhe Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537363800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636795","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Physical layer","Network security","Receivers","Array signal processing","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","OFDM modulation","radio networks","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM communication","phased array antenna","OFDM modulation","wireless physical layer security","OFDM symbols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","phased array","OFDM","angle-range-dependent"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation based on phased-array is proposed for wireless physical layer security. By applying distinct initial phases for different subcarriers of the OFDM symbols, the transmitted information will be angle-range-dependent. Numerical results show that, the OFDM symbols are well preserved in the desired location, while these symbols become scrambled in the phase at undesired locations. In doing so, proposed method achieves better secure performance in both angle and range dimensions than the traditional method. Moreover, in the proposed method, the initial phases can be calculated directly from the simple equations rather than time-consuming simulations. This implies that it is easy to implement in practice.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636795","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636795.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical layer security OFDM communication using phased array antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636795/","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer security OFDM communication using phased array antenna","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410236","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636795/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer security OFDM communication using phased array antenna","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570265826xiong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101976S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636801,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Shi","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085879753"},{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Lie-Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636801","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Receivers","Transmitters","Molecular communication","Demodulation","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","demodulation","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","molecular communication (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference cancellation","diffusion-based molecular communication system performance","OOK demodulation","on-off keying","nonzero threshold","binary molecular shift keying","DMC environment","low-complexity ISI cancellation approach","ISIC-assisted BMSK","error performance improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Molecular communications","diffusion","molecular shift keying","concentration shift keying","inter-symbol interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"We first compare the performance of the diffusion-based molecular communication (DMC) systems employing respectively the on-off keying (OOK), whose demodulation depends on a non-zero threshold, and the binary molecular shift keying (BMSK). Our studies demonstrate that the OOK is hard to operate in practical DMC environments, while the BMSK is more feasible for implementation in practice. Furthermore, the BMSK has the embedded capability to cancel some inter-symbol interference (ISI), making it significantly outperform the OOK in terms of the achievable error performance. Then, we propose a low-complexity ISI cancellation (ISIC) approach for further enhancing the performance of the BMSK. We propose two ways for estimating the parameters involved in the ISIC, both of which are demonstrated highly effective. The performance of the ISIC-assisted BMSK is compared with that of the OOK and that of the BMSK without ISIC, showing that the proposed ISIC approach is capable of significantly improving the error performance of the BMSK.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636801","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636801.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion-based molecular communications: Inter-symbol interference cancellation and system performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636801/","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion-based molecular communications: Inter-symbol interference cancellation and system performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410227","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636801/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion-based molecular communications: Inter-symbol interference cancellation and system performance","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570269274shi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05517S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636802,"authors":[{"name":"Weijie Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weijie","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085441571"},{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37571938800"},{"name":"Chengqi Ma","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengqi","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085881850"},{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292551600"},{"name":"Jingming Kuang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingming","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37266716500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636802","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Message passing","Gaussian distribution","Damping","Transceivers","Clocks","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","graph theory","message passing","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factor graph framework","passive localization problem","nonparametric message passing algorithm complexity reduction","damped expectation propagation method","Gaussian distribution","wireless network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive localization","factor graph","message damping","expectation propagation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636802","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636802.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Factor graph and damped expectation propagation based passive localization","abstract":"The location awareness of a \u201cpassive\u201d target has drawn much attention in recent years.

With its standardization in LTE networks, LTE multicast has attracted growing attention from industry recently. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient resource allocation for multicast services in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFD-MA) networks. Multiple description coding (MDC) technique is adopted to exploit multichannel diversity and multiuser diversity, which can eliminate the intrinsic inefficiencies of the multicast rate constraint. For the MDC based multicast services, we formulate a joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation problem to maximize the system energy efficiency under power constraints. To handle the fractional combinatorial optimization problem, we transform the problem into a subtractive form and then solve it using a Dinkelbach-based optimal algorithm, which requires full search of all possible user activation patterns. To reduce the complexity, we further propose a heuristic algorithm by separating user activation and power allocation for the original problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and validate the tradeoff between the energy efficiency and the spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636804","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636804.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient resource allocation for multiple description coding based multicast services in OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636804/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient resource allocation for multiple description coding based multicast services in OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410305","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636804/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient resource allocation for multiple description coding based multicast services in OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570269506gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062826S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636806,"authors":[{"name":"Zongdi Yue","affiliation":["Department of National key laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Zongdi","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085883264"},{"name":"Shu Fang","affiliation":["Department of National key laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37401407600"},{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["Department of National key laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085878018"},{"name":"Binyan Lu","affiliation":["Department of National key laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Binyan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085876387"},{"name":"Yuanchao Han","affiliation":["Department of National key laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Yuanchao","lastName":"Han","id":"37085883244"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Peng","affiliation":["Department of National key laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085876226"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636806","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Error probability","GSM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output techniques","multiple data streams","spectrum efficiency","spatial modulation MIMO techniques","multi-signal confliction problem","multi-stream space shift keying modulation scheme","MSSK modulation scheme","rotated signals","Euclidean distance","bit error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","spatial modulation","MSSK","spectrum efficiency","multi-signal confliction"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques take advantage of transmitting multiple data streams at the transmitter simultaneously to increase the spectrum efficiency. However, it is difficult for the newly emerging spatial modulation (SM) MIMO techniques to transmit multiple data streams directly, because of the multi-signal confliction problem. In this paper, we present a new multi-stream space shift keying (MSSK) modulation scheme for MIMO system, which modulates the multiple streams of signals to the transmitter by space shift keying (SSK) method without signal confliction. We adopt rotated signals to identify different streams and enlarge the Euclidean distance between streams without conveying any information. By smartly combining the rotated signals at the transmitter, the proposed MSSK modulation scheme is able to solve the multi-signal confliction problem in SSK system and increase the spectrum efficiency significantly. We also derive the tight upper bounds of bit error probability for MSSK and compare the proposed scheme with the existing SM MIMO schemes in this paper. Numerical results verify its effectiveness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-stream space shift keying modulation over MIMO channels","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636806","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636806.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-stream space shift keying modulation over MIMO channels","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636806/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410232","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-stream space shift keying modulation over MIMO channels","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570269602yue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117566S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636808,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085627589"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636808","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","MIMO","Precoding","Matrix decomposition","Generators","Euclidean distance","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal shaping based lattice code","MIMO system","shaping-based codebook construction method","max-min Euclidean distance based multiple input multiple output transmit codebook design","max-min precoder design","precoding matrix","optimal shaping region","hyperrectangle shaping region","lattice precoding","MIMO channel condition"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a shaping-based codebook construction method for max-min Euclidean distance based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmit codebook design.

With the aid of Minkowski inequality, we first derive the analytical closed-form expression of the lower bound on the ergodic capacity for D-MIMO systems over non-correlated K fading channels. The proposed lower bound becomes tight at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and when the number of receive antennas grows large. To intuitively reveal the impacts of system and fading parameters on the ergodic capacity, we deduce asymptotic approximations in the high SNR regime. Finally, we pursue the large systems analysis for the lower bound and derive closed-form expressions when the number of antennas at BS grows large, and when the number of antennas at transceiver becomes large with a fixed and finite ratio. It is demonstrated that the proposed expressions on the ergodic capacity accurately match with the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636809","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636809.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower bound on the ergodic capacity of distributed MIMO systems over K fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636809/","displayDocTitle":"Lower bound on the ergodic capacity of distributed MIMO systems over K fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410349","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636809/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower bound on the ergodic capacity of distributed MIMO systems over K fading channels","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570269618li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067895S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636811,"authors":[{"name":"Huipeng Meng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, P.R.

Usually, femto base stations (FBSs) have weak backhaul links but large storage capacity. When the requested files are cached, FBSs serve mobile users (MUs) through high-rate wireless link and avoid the backhaul bottleneck. However, the distributed caching problem is NP-complete. Previous works solve this problem with greedy algorithms in a centralized way. In this paper, we formulate this problem as an exact potential game (EPG), where each FBS acts as a game player with the constraint of cache size. The best Nash equilibrium (NE) is the global optimum solution of the distributed caching problem. We design an iterative algorithm in a decentralized way, where only local information exchange is needed. Theoretical analysis shows the best NE can be achieved and simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than the simple popular cache system and the traditional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China

In this paper, we propose to modify the minimum Euclidean distance of APSK constellations based on the Gaussian channel capacity achievable construction technology. We present a novel shaping function which could achieve considerable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement and faster convergence of APSK to the Gaussian channel capacity than conventional scheme.

Sub-Nyquist sampling has attracted significant interests for wideband spectrum sensing. In this paper, we propose a sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing algorithm that can estimate the spectrum of a multiband signal without sampling at full bandwidth through the use of multiple low-speed analog-to-digital converters based on multicoset sampling. To improve the detection performance under compressed measurements, cooperative spectrum sensing is adopted by fusing the sensing decisions of multiple secondary users (SUs). For energy conservation, we select the minimum number of participating SUs based on their channel conditions to achieve the desired high global detection probability. The mathematical model of the proposed sub-Nyquist wideband sensing algorithm is derived and verified by numerical analysis and tested on real-time TVWS signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636824/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410218","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Nyquist cooperative wideband spectrum sensing based on multicoset sampling for TV white spaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Nyquist cooperative wideband spectrum sensing based on multicoset sampling for TV white spaces","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570270148ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046008S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7636833,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jiang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085588797"},{"name":"Hui Tian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Tian","id":"37287120100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636833","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636833","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Array signal processing","Communication system security","Wireless communication","Receivers","Relays","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","computational complexity","concave programming","cooperative communication","radio transmitters","radiofrequency power transmission","relaxation theory","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming security","cooperative D2D communication","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","device-to-device communication","spectral efficiency","licensed cellular bandwidth","D2D transmitter","half-duplex relay","HD relay","cellular downlink transmission","information transmission security","D2D users data maximize","secrecy rate","nonconvex problem","semidefinite programming relaxation approach","SDR approach","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-device (D2D) communications","half-duplex relaying","physical layer security","secure beamforming","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636833","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636833.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure beamforming in cooperative D2D communications with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","abstract":"In device-to-device (D2D) communications, device terminal relaying makes it possible for devices in a network to function as transmission relays for each other to enhance the spectral efficiency. In this paper we consider a cooperative D2D communication scheme which allows two nearby devices to communicate with each other in the licensed cellular bandwidth by assigning D2D transmitters as half-duplex (HD) relay to assists cellular downlink transmissions. In particular, we focus on secure information transmission for the cellular users when the idle D2D users are the potential eavesdroppers. We aim to design secure beamforming to maximize the D2D users data rate while guaranteeing the secrecy rate requirements of the cellular users and the minimum required amounts of power transferred to the idle D2D users. To solve this non-convex problem, a semi-definite programming relaxation (SDR) approach is adopted to obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, we propose suboptimal secure beamforming scheme with low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves a significant transmission rate of the D2D users while provides a high secrecy rate for the cellular users and facilitates efficient power transfer for the idle D2D users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636833/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16410269","publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636833/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Secure beamforming in cooperative D2D communications with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure beamforming in cooperative D2D communications with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570270354jiang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072233S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7636838,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Ya Huang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Central University"],"firstName":"Chin-Ya","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085896729"},{"name":"Ke Xu","affiliation":["Cloud Solutions, Dell Inc."],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Xu","id":"38002169900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636838","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":785},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a distributed strategy for reliable realtime streaming in vehicular cloud-fog networks.

Therefore, the reliability of the realtime streaming can be effectively maintained. Another important aspect of the proposed strategy is that the scheme can adapts to the change of the behavior of the mobile device and the condition of the computing resources without tuning the parameters for execution.

spectrum access for cognitive small cell networks: A robust graphical game approach","abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of distributed spectrum access for cognitive small cell networks. Compared with existing work, two inherent features are considered: i) the transmission of a cognitive small cell base station only interferes with its neighbors due to the low power, i.e., the interference is local, and ii) the channel state is time-varying due to fading. We formulate the problem as a robust graphical game, and prove that it is an ordinal potential game which has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). Also, the lower throughput bound of NE solutions is analytically obtained. To cope with the dynamic and incomplete information constraints, we propose a distribute spectrum access algorithm to converge to some stable results. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed game-theoretic distributed learning solution in time-varying spectrum environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636839/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16410356","publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636839/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access for cognitive small cell networks: A robust graphical game approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access for cognitive small cell networks: A robust graphical game approach","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570270465xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133619S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7636841,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communication Networks (Ministry of Education), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085667144"},{"name":"Chongfu Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communication Networks (Ministry of Education), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chongfu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37400242400"},{"name":"Wei Jin","affiliation":["Key Lab of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communication Networks (Ministry of Education), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085361063"},{"name":"Kun Qiu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communication Networks (Ministry of Education), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37320319600"},{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240992500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636841","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Encryption","Time-frequency analysis","OFDM","Optical network units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","passive optical networks","quadrature amplitude modulation","telecommunication security","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid time-frequency domain chaotic interleaving technique","physical-layer security enhancement","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based passive optical network","OFDM-PON systems","discrete Baker map","Henon map","quadrature amplitude modulation OFDM signal","QAM OFDM signal","standard single mode fiber","SSMF","security enhanced OFDM-PON system","bit rate 19.2 Gbit/s","distance 30 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM-PON","chaotic interleaving","security"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a hybrid time-frequency domain chaotic interleaving technique for physical-layer security enhancement in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based passive optical network (OFDM-PON) systems.

It is envisioned that traditional cloud computing gradually fail to fully meet the requirements of evergrowing large-scale mobile services due to potential problems, such as high service latency, lack of location-awareness and user mobility support. Compared to cloud computing, fog computing can address these problems by utilizing elastic resources (e.g., computation, storage and networking) of edge nodes (i.e., fog nodes) to provide enhanced service quality with increased network capacity and low latency. However, due to the limited resources of the edge nodes, especially for resource-poor mobile devices, there are strict constraints on energy conservation. As an efficient way, wireless communication at a short distance could be exploited to reduce energy consumption for resource-poor mobile devices in fog computing. In addition, it's crucial to improve the utilization of edge nodes and guarantee that mobile devices can access to the edge nodes rapidly. In this paper, by leveraging social networking and Device-to-device (D2D) communication, we are motivated to propose a novel paradigm of mobile caching network with energy-efficient edge nodes, called CachinMobile. Performance evaluation is carried out to verify that CachinMobile can considerably improve energy efficiency, and meanwhile, maintain satisfying QoS.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636852","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636852.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CachinMobile: An energy-efficient users caching scheme for fog computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636852/","displayDocTitle":"CachinMobile: An energy-efficient users caching scheme for fog computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410353","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636852/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CachinMobile: An energy-efficient users caching scheme for fog computing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570270742wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079403S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636853,"authors":[{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Xiaochun Yue","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085899330"},{"name":"Deyue Qiao","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Deyue","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085906694"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085905838"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636853","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Antennas","Throughput","MIMO","Mathematical model","Block codes","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","linear codes","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO system","massive multiple-input multiple-output system","space-time block code","base station antennas","dual antennas","uplink user diversity gain performance improvement","linear decoder","minimum mean squared error decoder","zero-forcing decoder","error rate performance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a massive Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with space-time block codes is studied.

However, to achieve the capacity-approaching performance, beam selection requires the accurate information of beamspace channel of large size, which is challenging, especially when the number of RF chains is limited. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a reliable support detection (SD)-based channel estimation scheme. Specifically, we propose to decompose the total beamspace channel estimation problem into a series of sub-problems, each of which only considers one sparse channel component. For each channel component, we first reliably detect its support by utilizing the structural characteristics of mmWave beamspace channel. Then, the influence of this channel component is removed from the total beamspace channel estimation problem. After the supports of all channel components have been detected, the nonzero elements of the sparse beamspace channel can be estimated with low pilot overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed SD-based channel estimation outperforms conventional schemes and enjoys satisfying accuracy, even in the low SNR region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636854/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16410255","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636854/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beamspace channel estimation for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems with lens antenna array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamspace channel estimation for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems with lens antenna array","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570270800dai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119312S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7636864,"authors":[{"name":"Shangbin Wu","affiliation":["Samsung R&D Institute UK, Staines-upon-Thames, UK"],"firstName":"Shangbin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085346725"},{"name":"Cheng-Xiang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Cheng-Xiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292500000"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["SIMIT, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37069172900"},{"name":"Wenjin Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Wenjin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292856200"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636864","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":760},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","electromagnetic wave polarisation","geometry","MIMO communication","stochastic processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multiple-input multiple-output channel models","massive MIMO channel models","cross correlation function","CCF","normalized channel capacities","geometry based stochastic models","3D unified GBSM","Kronecker based stochastic model","birth death process","array axis","KBSM-BD-AA","3D twin-cluster model","polarization antennas","antenna array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","2-D ellipse model","3-D twin-cluster model","3-D unified GBSM","KBSM-BD-AA"]}],"abstract":"This paper compares the spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs) and normalized channel capacities of four recently proposed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel models.

Compared with traditional multiple access technologies, PDMA brings more serious multiple address interference to hinder the multiuser detection. The universal detection algorithm with low complexity and high performance is one of the main challenges of PDMA technology. In this paper, we proposed a new iterative detection and decoding algorithm, which is a successive interference cancellation (SIC) iterative processing based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection and channel decoding algorithm. It is essentially a SIC iterative processing based on some users' information has been correctly decoded by the MMSE detection and the channel decoder. The proposed multiuser detection algorithm can prevent the error propagation by the cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can get significant performance gains over traditional multiuser detection algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636865","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636865.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detection algorithm for PDMA uplink system based on SIC and MMSE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detection algorithm for PDMA uplink system based on SIC and MMSE","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636865/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410335","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detection algorithm for PDMA uplink system based on SIC and MMSE","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570271155kong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050307S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636870,"authors":[{"name":"Jianyi Yang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Jianyi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085897262"},{"name":"Zaixue Wei","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Zaixue","lastName":"Wei","id":"37873862100"},{"name":"Nanxi Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Nanxi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085783734"},{"name":"Lin Sang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Sang","id":"37545274500"},{"name":"Pengxiang Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Pengxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085885792"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636870","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":482},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636870","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Estimation error","Channel estimation","Training","Millimeter wave technology","Precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","iterative methods","precoding","radiocommunication","signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution hierarchical codebook design enhancement","adaptive compressed sensing-based millimeter wave channel estimation","CSI estimation algorithm","channel state information estimation algorithm","precoding","mmWave system","angle of arrival detection","AoD estimation","angle of departure detection","spectral efficiency","iterative adjustment algorithm","AoA estimation"]}],"abstract":"Perfect channel state information (CSI) is essential for precoding and combining in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. The CSI estimation algorithm based on adaptive compressed sensing (CS) is an efficient method. However, the imperfect multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design possibly leads to wrong detections of angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD), which has a negative effect on the spectral efficiency. In this paper, an enhanced multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design is proposed to realize precise AoD/AoA estimation. First, the necessary number of sampling angles for generating the codebook is given. Then, the algorithm of iterative adjustment (IA) is developed to improve the codebook design. Simulation results show that using the proposed codebook design, the beams can precisely divide the AoA/AoD intervals as the requirements of the adaptive CS based algorithm. Thus, the average angle estimation error is reduced effectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636870","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636870.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design for adaptive compressed sensing based millimeter wave channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design for adaptive compressed sensing based millimeter wave channel estimation","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636870/","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410242","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636870/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design for adaptive compressed sensing based millimeter wave channel estimation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570271177yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094712S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7636871,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"37715917500"},{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Tiankui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288850400"},{"name":"Zhimin Zeng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636871","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","energy conservation","iterative methods","optimisation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient joint energy beamforming and time allocation","QoS requirements","wireless energy transfer","mobile device","energy supplier","terminal wireless charging","WET broadcast","wireless information transfer","WIT","quality of service requirements","time duplexing factor","beamforming vector","WET power consumption minimization","iterative optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-convex QCQP","energy beamforming","semidefinite relaxation","wireless energy transfer","wireless information transfer"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy efficient joint energy beamforming and time allocation with QoS guarantee via wireless energy transfer","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636871","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636871","abstract":"Wireless energy transfer (WET) has been considered as a promising technology for providing mobile devices with untethered energy supply in wireless networks. In this paper, we assume one energy supplier (ES) and multiple WET powered terminals coexist. The ES wirelessly charge the terminals, and then terminals transfer their own information synchronously. The WET broadcast and wireless information transfer (WIT) take place in time duplexing manner. The WET powered terminals are assumed to have individual quality of service (QoS) requirements of information transfer. The joint design of downlink WET broadcast beamforming and time allocation between energy/information transfer is studied. An two step algorithm is proposed to jointly design both time duplexing factor and beamforming vector, in order to guarantee the terminals' QoS, meanwhile to minimize the WET power consumption by WET. To avoid iterative search, proposed algorithm first determine the time allocating factor by minimizing the lower bound of WET power. Then the optimal WET beamforming vector is obtained to guarantee terminals' QoS. Simulation results demonstrates proposed algorithm provides majority of the performance of global optimal solution while avoiding the computational burden of iterative optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16410238","htmlLink":"/document/7636871/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"An energy efficient joint energy beamforming and time allocation with QoS guarantee via wireless energy transfer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy efficient joint energy beamforming and time allocation with QoS guarantee via wireless energy transfer","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570271182li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055856S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636874,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Lu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085882755"},{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiankui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288850400"},{"name":"Zhimin Zeng","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7636874","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Principal component analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Indexes","Smart grids","Smart meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","computational complexity","pattern clustering","power engineering computing","principal component analysis","smart meters","smart power grids","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive weighted fuzzy clustering algorithm","smart grid customer load profiling","smart meter data","time series","principle component analysis","PCA","data dimension reduction","weighted fuzzy C-means","weighted FCM","Big Data","time complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load profiles","customer classification","PCA","weighted FCM","cluster validity"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive weighted fuzzy clustering algorithm for load profiling of smart grid customers","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636874.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636874","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636874","abstract":"With the rapid development of the smart grid, a large volume of smart meter data are collected in the form of time series, which is called load profiles.

Among the various environment monitoring technologies, the microwave radar detection technology tends to civilian use and plays an important role in environmental safety monitoring. Though rich continuous spectrum resources are available in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, in order to overcome unfavorable path loss, directional beamforming is usually used as an essential technology to concentrate radio signal radiation energy. To ensure the safety of train operation, we propose an mmWave beamforming scheme for railway disaster detection. In this proposed scheme, the concerned area around railways is divided into different detection areas with different danger sensitivity levels. Considering propagation characteristics of radio signals with different frequency bands within a wide frequency range, the antenna array generates multiple beams with different beam widths in different frequency bands simultaneously, and the multiple beams are responsible for different detection areas. Moreover, different detection resolutions are set for different detection areas to apply to different beam scanning schemes. Performance analysis results have demonstrated that the proposed beamforming scheme can not only greatly improve the detection efficiency, but also decrease the false alarm rate.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636883.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An mmWave beamforming scheme for disaster detection in high speed railway","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636883/","displayDocTitle":"An mmWave beamforming scheme for disaster detection in high speed railway","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410315","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An mmWave beamforming scheme for disaster detection in high speed railway","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570273026he.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066536S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7636888,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273742000"},{"name":"Shan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085424673"},{"name":"Jianchao Zheng","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38238014300"},{"name":"Xiaojie Fang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaojie","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085905951"},{"name":"Jon W.

However, the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) of the edge cloud are generally different from the CSPs of remote Internet cloud. Considering the competition between the heterogeneous clouds, we study the optimal provisioning of the computational resource in the edge cloud. We firstly analyze the Nash equilibrium prices of the cloud market when the amount of edge computational resource is given. Based on the pricing policy, we further design an algorithm to optimize the edge computational resource capacity so that the profit of the edge cloud is maximized. We also derive the lower and upper bound of the optimal edge computational resource.

The concept of effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) is introduced to measure the maximum spatial multiplexing gain available for the MIMO system. A criterion based on the maximized EDoF is given out for the design of antenna deployments. A specific analytic relation between the parameters of antenna configuration and transmission distance is further obtained for codebook based phase shifters. Compared to previous structures, the asymmetric subarray structure can provide both array gains and spatial multiplexing gains and is beneficial for making a tradeoff between multiplexing gains and diversity gains. At the same time, the upper and lower bounds of the EDoF are also estimated under extreme cases. Based on the Ricean fading channel model, the sensitivity of our system is studied by taking more realistic deployments and propagation conditions into consideration. The simulation results indicate that the optimally designed structure is robust to the geometrical change and misplacement and thus it is a feasible solution for mmWave LoS MIMO applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China

Existing works ensure the connectivity of the CRN with only one channel reclaimed by PU, without considering a general case that PUs occupy multiple channels simultaneously, thereby resulting in a network partition. In this paper, we aim at guaranteeing the k-channel-connectivity of the CRN, which refers to maintain the CRN's connectivity even when any k - 1 channels are requested by PUs at the same time. Particularly, we achieve the target by ensuring that any k - 1 independent sets (i.e., groups of SUs that transmit on the same channel) are not any vertex-cut set of the CRN. With that guidance, we firstly propose a topology control algorithm to minimize the number of channels required by the CRN, and to ensures that the topology remains k-channel-connected and conflict-free as well. Secondly, the correctness of the proposed algorithm is verified via theoretical analysis. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm can not only enables the reductions of the required channels, but also the power consumption of the CRN.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636898.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving k-channel-connectivity with topology control in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636898/","displayDocTitle":"Achieving k-channel-connectivity with topology control in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410233","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving k-channel-connectivity with topology control in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570276765liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061882S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7636903,"authors":[{"name":"Pengxiang Li","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.

In this paper, a modified uplink signal structure is proposed to reduce the negative effects of pilot contamination. Specifically, we add a certain amount of identification information for distinguishing the terminals in different cells at the beginning of uplink signals. With this improved uplink signal structure, the BS obtains better channel estimates. Then uplink signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and available capacity are obviously increased. Further, we also analyze the performance of actual situation when errors occur during the transmission of identification information. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of this signal structure in obtaining better available capacity when the coherence interval is high.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636903","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592393/7636714/07636903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7636714","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink signal structure design for multi-cell TDD massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uplink signal structure design for multi-cell TDD massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636903/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410246","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636903/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink signal structure design for multi-cell TDD massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"m1570280376li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09329S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592393","isNumber":"7636714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592393","xplore-issue":"7636714","articleId":"7636903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7636934,"authors":[{"name":"Yajuan Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Academia Sinica, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8244326/7636934/liu-2614709-small.gif","p":["Yajuan Liu received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Shanxi Normal University, Linfen, China, in 2010, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree from the Division of Electronic Engineering, Daegu University, Deagu, South Korea, in 2015.

The sampled-data feedback control, which is assumed to allow norm-bounded uncertainty and involves a constant signal transmission delay, is constructed for the first time in this paper. By constructing a suitable augmented Lyapunov function, and with the help of introduced integral inequalities and employing the convex combination technique, a sufficient condition is developed, such that the nonfragile exponential stability of the error system is guaranteed. As a result, for the case of sampled-data control free of norm-bound uncertainties, some sufficient conditions of sampled-data synchronization criteria for the CDNs with time-varying coupling delay are presented. As the formulations are in the framework of linear matrix inequality, these conditions can be easily solved and implemented. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed feedback control.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8244326/07636934.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8244326","startPage":"118","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonfragile Exponential Synchronization of Delayed Complex Dynamical Networks With Memory Sampled-Data Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonfragile Exponential Synchronization of Delayed Complex Dynamical Networks With Memory Sampled-Data Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17468812","pubMedId":"28113785","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7636934/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002649","fundingName":"2016 Yeungnam University Research Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonfragile Exponential Synchronization of Delayed Complex Dynamical Networks With Memory Sampled-Data Control","sourcePdf":"tnnls-park-2614709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117578S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8244326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"8244326","articleId":"7636934","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7636935,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Hashim Raza Bukhari","affiliation":["COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Attock, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7636935/bukha-2618418-small.gif","p":["Syed Hashim Raza Bukhari received the B.Eng. degree in computer engineering from the COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT), Wah Cantt, Pakistan, in 2007, and the M.S degree from the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan, in 2011.

The ISM band has been already saturated due to the overlaid deployment of WSNs. To solve this problem, WSNs have been powered up by cognitive radio (CR) capability. By using CR capability, WSNs can utilize the spectrum holes opportunistically. The sensor nodes, which need large bandwidth to transmit their sensed data from source to destination require some scheme, which should be able to provide them a wide band channel whenever required. Channel bonding (CB) is a technique through which multiple contiguous channels can be combined to form a single wide band channel. By using CB technique, CR-based WSN nodes attempt to find and combine contiguous channels to avail larger bandwidth. In this paper, we show that by increasing the number of channels, the probability of finding contiguous channels decreases. Moreover, we then propose a primary-radio (PR) user-activity-aware CB algorithm and compare it with three state-of-the-art schemes: SWA, KNOWS, and AGILE. It has been demonstrated through extensive NS-2 simulations that intelligent CB decisions can reduce harmful interference to PR nodes. We find that CB in CR sensor networks attempts to provide greater bandwidth and utilizes the spectrum effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16433053","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636935/","displayDocTitle":"PRACB: A Novel Channel Bonding Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"PRACB: A Novel Channel Bonding Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-bukhari-2618418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168137S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7636935","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7636936,"authors":[{"name":"Gervais N.

After developing the channel model, where the Weichselberger method is exploited to reformulate the Kronecker model and allow closed-form analysis, an upper bound on the spectral efficiency of the MIMO channel is first established, by using the Hadamard's determinant inequality for positive semidefinite matrices. Then, an asymptotic analysis in high signal-to-noise ratio regime is conducted, which explicitly reveals the effects of the aforementioned parameters on the spectral efficiency. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of the spectral efficiency in the sense of massive MIMO, i.e., as the number of transmit and/or receive antennas approaches infinity, is investigated. Monte Carlo simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the analysis and the accuracy of the obtained upper bound on the spectral efficiency. Thanks to its high generality, the analysis developed in this paper benefits system designers in the design and performance evaluation of either regular or massive MIMO systems while accounting for realistic phenomena characterizing both the propagation environment and the antenna arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2620489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07636936.pdf","startPage":"4984","endPage":"4996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2620489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral-Efficiency Analysis of Regular- and Large-Scale (Massive) MIMO With a Comprehensive Channel Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636936/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral-Efficiency Analysis of Regular- and Large-Scale (Massive) MIMO With a Comprehensive Channel Model","volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965027","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636936/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671488 and 61501527"},{"fundingName":"Special Fund for Science and Technology Development in Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A050503025 and 2016B010126003"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"201604010073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral-Efficiency Analysis of Regular- and Large-Scale (Massive) MIMO With a Comprehensive Channel Model","sourcePdf":"tvt-nkamga-2620489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122975S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7636936","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7636938,"authors":[{"name":"Dongku Kang","affiliation":["Flash Product and Technology, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Hwaseong, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7811159/7636938/dkang-2604297-small.gif","p":["Dongku Kang received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2004.","In 2005, he joined the Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Hwaseong, South Korea, as a NAND Flash Memory Designer, where he was involved in classical 60 nm SLC NAND, planar NAND, and Vnand design projects.

Results indicate that the presence of the ground plane and/or vertical parallel-plate structures in the channel introduces multipath that, if constructively superimposed, may create a path loss lower than free-space propagation path loss. In addition, it has been found that a few centimeters of vertical misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver result in a path loss greater than 5 dB. Furthermore, the results indicate that vertical components such as dual in-line memory modules with reflection coefficient close to one for all incident angles can be used to create directed non-line-of-sight (LoS) links with wide coherence bandwidth. Finally, for LoS propagation obstructed by large objects, such as a heatsink, the path-loss exponent of 1.77 is found, while the rotating fan causes periodic fading in the received power, indicating that channel equalization techniques will be needed to overcome deep fades. All these results indicate that optimal communications can be achieved by carefully positioning the antennas with respect to the motherboard layout.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2620598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7769172/07636947.pdf","startPage":"5411","endPage":"5423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2620598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7769172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of 300-GHz Wireless Channel on a Computer Motherboard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636947","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8/7769172/7636947-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636947/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of 300-GHz Wireless Channel on a Computer Motherboard","volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16521204","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7636947/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1318934"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Characterization of 300-GHz Wireless Channel on a Computer Motherboard","sourcePdf":"tap-zajic-2620598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124064S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7769172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7769172","articleId":"7636947","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7636952,"authors":[{"name":"Guohai Liu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drive and Intelligent Control for Electric Vehicle, Zhenjiang, China","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"p":["Guohai Liu (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree from Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China, in 1985, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and control engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1988 and 2002, respectively.","Since 1988, he has been with Jiangsu University, where he is currently a Professor and the Dean of the School of Electrical Information Engineering.

The association strategy was developed to jointly maximize downlink (DL) sum rate and minimize total uplink (UL) transmit power for H2HDs while maximizing UL energy efficiency for IoTDs. The association problem is formulated as a cooperative Nash bargaining game. We first develop a two-player bargaining algorithm for two base stations to bargain their associated devices. Then, based on this algorithm and the Hungarian method, a multi-player bargaining algorithm is developed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparable schemes, especially in terms of DL rate distribution for H2HDs, device side energy efficiency for IoTDs, as well as fairness performance among devices.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07636958.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Device Association in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With H2H/IoT Co-Existence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Device Association in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With H2H/IoT Co-Existence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636958/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16668410","htmlLink":"/document/7636958/","volume":"21","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Device Association in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With H2H/IoT Co-Existence","sourcePdf":"lcomm-elmesalawy-2620468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057186S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7636958","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7636964,"authors":[{"name":"Yonggui Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Network Control, Ministry of Education, College of Automatic Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7956367/7636964/liu-2615302-small.gif","p":["Yonggui Liu (M\u201915) was born in Hunan, China.

This paper focuses on cooperative braking control of autonomous vehicles, the objectives of which are to ensure intervehicles keep within the safe spacing range and rapidly, smoothly, and accurately stop at the desired target stopping positions with zero velocity. To achieve these goals, a three-vehicle platoon framework is presented and the corresponding dynamic model is established based on only information about front-end and rear-end sensors of vehicles, so communication is not needed. The explicit solutions on the three-vehicle platoon are derived by rigorous convergent analysis and detailed proof, such that intrinsic characteristic of the interconnected vehicles is revealed. The resulting convergent conditions and convergent rate are obtained under three cases including: 1) considering internal virtual forces; 2) considering external braking forces; and 3) considering both the internal virtual forces and external braking forces simultaneously. Moreover, an example is further provided to verify that the derived convergence conditions are effective and sufficient under the different controller parameter selection. These results can provide a solution for a wide class of interconnected systems and a guide for controller design to select control parameters in real engineering applications. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed control approaches.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2016.2615302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956367","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1906","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7956367/07636964.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Cooperative Braking Control for Interconnected Vehicle Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636964/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Cooperative Braking Control for Interconnected Vehicle Systems","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969450","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"7","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573153 and 61401157"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Guangdong Joint Foundation Key Project","grantNumber":"U1401253"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan Project","grantNumber":"201510010132"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030313510"},{"fundingName":"Special Application Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016B090927007"},{"fundingName":"ISN Laboratory","grantNumber":"ISN16-06"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Knowledge Innovation Program","grantNumber":"JCYJ20130401172046453"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence Analysis of Cooperative Braking Control for Interconnected Vehicle Systems","sourcePdf":"tits-ding-2615302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092843S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7956367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7956367","articleId":"7636964","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7636965,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Gama Rodrigues","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7893086/7636965/rodri-2620469-small.gif","p":["Tiago Gama Rodrigues received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer\n science from the Federal University of Piaui, in Brazil, in 2014.

This results in many applications that cannot be run in such devices. This problem is fixed by Edge Cloud Computing, where the users offload tasks they cannot run to cloudlet servers in the edge of the network. The main requirement of such a system is having a low Service Delay, which would correspond to a high Quality of Service. This paper presents a method for minimizing Service Delay in a scenario with two cloudlet servers. The method has a dual focus on computation and communication elements, controlling Processing Delay through virtual machine migration and improving Transmission Delay with Transmission Power Control. The foundation of the proposal is a mathematical model of the scenario, whose analysis is used on a comparison between the proposed approach and two other conventional methods; these methods have single focus and only make an effort to improve either Transmission Delay or Processing Delay, but not both. As expected, the proposal presents the lowest Service Delay in all study cases, corroborating our conclusion that a dual focus approach is the best way to tackle the Service Delay problem in Edge Cloud Computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636965/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2017","volume":"66","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"16824247","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2017","publicationDate":"1 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7636965/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Method for Minimizing Service Delay in Edge Cloud Computing Through VM Migration and Transmission Power Control","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"},{"fundingName":"ICT"},{"fundingName":"National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Method for Minimizing Service Delay in Edge Cloud Computing Through VM Migration and Transmission Power Control","sourcePdf":"tc-gamarodrigues-2620469-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113057S","chronDate":"May 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7893086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"7893086","articleId":"7636965","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7636966,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085803312"},{"name":"Shaowei Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shaowei","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-0143-556X","id":"37538887500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7636966","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":602},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Mobile communication","Planning","Joining processes","Baseband","Radio access networks","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cloud computing","computational complexity","integer programming","linear programming","mobile radio","radio access networks","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baseband unit pool planning","cloud radio access networks","approximation algorithm","C-RAN","mobile communication systems","baseband unit pool planning problem","BBU pool planning problem","total deployment cost","traffic demands","remote radio heads","mixed integer linear programming problem","NP-hard problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximation algorithm","BBU pool planning","C-RAN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07636966.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620461","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Baseband Unit Pool Planning for Cloud Radio Access Networks: An Approximation Algorithm","abstract":"Cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) are proposed as promising architecture to improve the capacity and enhance the coverage of mobile communication systems.

We consider a model where an adversary attacks a zone by physically disconnecting some of its power lines and blocking the information flow from the zone to the grid's control center. We use tools from linear algebra and graph theory and leverage the properties of the linearized power flow model to develop methods for information recovery. Using information observed outside the attacked zone, these methods recover information about the disconnected lines and the phase angles at the buses. We identify sufficient conditions on the zone structure and constraints on the attack characteristics such that these methods can recover the information. We also show that it is NP-hard to find an approximate solution to the problem of partitioning the power grid into the minimum number of attack-resilient zones. However, since power grids can often be represented by planar graphs, we develop a constant approximation partitioning algorithm for these graphs and numerically demonstrate its performance on real power grids.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6509490/8318955/07636987.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCNS.2016.2620807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCNS.2016.2620807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318955","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7636987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Grid State Estimation Following a Joint Cyber and Physical Attack","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power grids","Phasor measurement units","Approximation algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Transmission line matrix methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","graph theory","linear algebra","load flow","optimisation","power engineering computing","power grids","power system security","power system state estimation","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power grid state estimation","physical attack","grid state information","power lines","information flow","linear algebra","graph theory","linearized power flow model","information recovery","attacked zone","zone structure","attack characteristics","attack-resilient zones","cyber attack","grid control center","planar graphs","constant approximation partitioning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power grids","cyber attacks","physical attacks","state estimation","line failure detection"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6509490/8318955/7636987-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Power Grid State Estimation Following a Joint Cyber and Physical Attack","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7636987/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633748","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-13-1-0021"},{"fundingName":"DARPA RADICS","grantNumber":"#FA-8750-16-C-0054"},{"fundingName":"U.S. DOE OE","grantNumber":"078/2015/A3"},{"fundingName":"DOE Grid Modernization Initiative"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1320654 and CCF-1423100"},{"fundingName":"Blavatnik ICRC"},{"fundingName":"BSF"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Power Grid State Estimation Following a Joint Cyber and Physical Attack","sourcePdf":"tcns-soltan-2620807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216326S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"8318955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8318955","articleId":"7636987","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7636988,"authors":[{"name":"Jayadev Acharya","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jayadev Acharya (M\u201914) is an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Cornell University.

A problem of maximizing the number of real-time tasks with replications running on a multiprocessor embedded system is discussed in this letter. The partitioning problem can be modeled as a variant of the bin-packing problem. In the original problem, it is known that the first-fit (FF) method has a good worst-case performance bound of 4/3. Whether or not the same bound is achievable in the variant problem remains an open question. This letter closes the question by proving that the worst-case performance bound of using the FF method approaches to 2 but it never reaches it. Then, a tight bound of asymptotic worst-case performance is shown.","doi":"10.1109/LES.2016.2620473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LES.2016.2620473","startPage":"89","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563995/7738317/07636995.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partitioning Real-Time Tasks With Replications on Multiprocessor Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7636995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Partitioning Real-Time Tasks With Replications on Multiprocessor Embedded Systems","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16486402","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7636995/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioning Real-Time Tasks With Replications on Multiprocessor Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"les-lin-2620473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106199S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4563995","isNumber":"7738317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563995","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7738317","articleId":"7636995","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7637004,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Chahibi","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Youssef Chahibi (S\u201913) received the Dipl\u00f4me d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur in telecommunications and networks from Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, Toulouse, France, in 2011, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","During 2011, he was a Physical-Layer Engineer at Alcatel-Lucent, Antwerp, Belgium.

Living cells are naturally enabled with this same mechanism to establish point-to-point communication between different locations inside the cell. Similar to a railway system, the cytoplasm contains an intricate infrastructure of tracks, named microtubules, interconnecting different internal components of the cell. Motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, are able to travel along these tracks directionally, carrying with them large molecules that would otherwise be unreliably transported across the cytoplasm using free diffusion. Molecular communication has been previously proposed for the design and study of MMNs. However, the topological aspects of MMNs, including the effects of branches, have been ignored in the existing studies. In this paper, a physical end-to-end model for MMNs is developed, considering the location of the transmitter node, the network topology, and the receiver nodes. The end-to-end gain and group delay are considered as the performance measures, and analytical expressions for them are derived. The analytical model is validated by Monte-Carlo simulations and the performance of MMNs is analyzed numerically. It is shown that, depending on their nature and position, MMN nodes create impedance effects that are critical for the overall performance. This model could be applied to assist the design of artificial MMNs and to study cargo transport in neurofilaments to elucidate brain diseases related to microtubule jamming.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2016.2620439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2016.2620439","startPage":"917","endPage":"927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7818038/07637004.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Modeling and Analysis of Molecular Motors in Molecular Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Modeling and Analysis of Molecular Motors in Molecular Communication","volume":"15","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16597926","pubMedId":"28092503","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7637004/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) during the tenure of a Mobility Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"\u201cMedical Sensing, Localization, and Communications using Ultra Wideband Technology (MELODY) II\u201d","grantNumber":"225885/O70"},{"fundingName":"Research Council of Norway"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Modeling and Analysis of Molecular Motors in Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"tnb-chahibi-2620439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098736S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7818038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7818038","articleId":"7637004","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7637008,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In particular, we derive a closed-form expression for the average residual self-interference (SI) power and show its functional dependence on the parameters of the radio- frequency impairments and channel taps' power. Moreover, for perfect digital-domain cancellation, we show that the effects of PN and IQI can be approximately decoupled for small PN and IQI levels and the average residual SI is linearly proportional to the I/Q image rejection ratio and PN 3-dB bandwidth. Our numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and our findings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"21","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16668374","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7637008/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Residual Self-Interference Analysis for Full-Duplex OFDM Transceivers Under Phase Noise and I/Q Imbalance","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"GSRA from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"#2-1-0601-14011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual Self-Interference Analysis for Full-Duplex OFDM Transceivers Under Phase Noise and I/Q Imbalance","sourcePdf":"lcomm-samara-2620431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047089S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7637008","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7637017,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Saeidi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Micro and Nano-electronic Devices, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7739934/7637017/saeid-2616035-small.gif","p":["Ali Saeidi received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronic engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.","In 2014, he joined the Laboratory of Micro/Nanoelectronic Devices, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, as a Ph.D. candidate.

All necessary parameters are extracted by carefully characterizing experimentally fabricated ferroelectric capacitors, to ensure realistic simulation results. The ferroelectric thickness obtained by the proposed approach leads to the maximum enhancement in the nonhysteretic operation of NC transistors. We report a clear and significant double improvement in: 1) subthreshold swing and 2) gate overdrive, using the NC effect. Simulations using Silvaco TCAD coupled with a realistic Landau model of ferroelectrics demonstrates that a 14-nm node ultrathin body and box fully depleted silicon-on-insulator FET can operate at 0.26 V instead of 0.9 V gate voltage using the NC effect, with an average subthreshold swing of 55 mV/decade at room temperature. The double-gate structure is proposed to overcome the large mismatch between the ferroelectric and MOS capacitor to enhance the NC effect and reduce the ferroelectric's optimized thickness. A 14-nm node double-gate negative capacitance FET can operate at 0.24 V gate voltage with an average subthreshold swing of 45 mV/decade.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7739934/07637017.pdf","startPage":"4678","endPage":"4684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2016.2616035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2016.2616035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7637017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-Gate Negative-Capacitance MOSFET With PZT Gate-Stack on Ultra Thin Body SOI: An Experimentally Calibrated Simulation Study of Device Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","MOSFET","Silicon-on-insulator","Field effect transistors","Semiconductor device modeling","Electrostatics","Ferroelectric materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric capacitors","MOSFET","semiconductor device models","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-gate negative-capacitance MOSFET","PZT gate-stack","ultra thin body SOI","nonhysteretic negative capacitance","PZT ferroelectric","ferroelectric capacitors","ferroelectric thickness","subthreshold swing","gate overdrive","box fully depleted silicon-on-insulator FET","double-gate structure","voltage 0.26 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double-gate negative capacitance FET (DG NCFET)","ferroelectric","NCFET","negative capacitance (NC)","ultrathin body and box fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (UTBB FDSOI)-NCFET"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Double-Gate Negative-Capacitance MOSFET With PZT Gate-Stack on Ultra Thin Body SOI: An Experimentally Calibrated Simulation Study of Device Performance","volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7637017/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16486089","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Fundation","grantNumber":"149495"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-Gate Negative-Capacitance MOSFET With PZT Gate-Stack on Ultra Thin Body SOI: An Experimentally Calibrated Simulation Study of Device Performance","sourcePdf":"ted-saeidi-2616035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055199S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7739934","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7739934","articleId":"7637017","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"EU","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7637022,"authors":[{"name":"Wu-Sheng Lu","affiliation":["Depertment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7755810/7637022/lu-2613880-small.gif","p":["Wu-Sheng Lu (S\u201981\u2013M\u201985\u2013SM\u201990\u2013F\u201999\u2013LF\u201912) received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1964, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in control science from University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, in 1983 and 1984, respectively.

We present an analysis to explain why CCP is well-suited for the design problems at hand. We also show that the CCP-based design framework is flexible to allow extension to the design of FRM filters that simultaneously promotes sparsity of the filter coefficients to reduce implementation complexity.

However, the close coupling of mechanical and electronic behavior in these devices can limit performance and introduce artifacts. In order to mitigate negative effects, and to facilitate greater control over mechanical and electronic performance, we present a method for designing soft tactile sensors based on multi-layer heterogeneous 3D structures that combine active layers, containing embedded liquid metal electrodes, with passive and mechanically tunable layers, containing air cavities and micropillar array geometric supports. The assembled devices consist of thin membranes that integrate arrays of tactile sensors with 2-mm spatial resolution. They are produced using a soft lithography fabrication method based on the casting, alignment, and fusion of multiple functional layers in a soft polymer substrate. We have optimized the electronic and mechanical performance of these devices using numerical simulations. The results accurately predicted measured performance, making it possible to tailor both electronic and mechanical properties. These methods enable the design of tactile sensing arrays that are highly conformable and robust, and that possess a number of desirable attributes, including high sensitivity, monotonic output, good linearity, low cross-talk, low rate dependence, and low hysteresis. This may enable new applications in wearable electronics, healthcare, and robotics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7747553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2016.2618784","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2016.2618784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7747553/07637025.pdf","startPage":"8908","endPage":"8915","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Tactile sensors","Performance evaluation","Soft lithography","Capacitance","Microfluidics","Wearable sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["casting","electrodes","membranes","microassembling","microfluidics","microsensors","numerical analysis","polymers","sensor arrays","soft lithography","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic channel assembly","compliant soft tactile sensor array","soft electronics","negative effect mitigation","multilayer heterogeneous 3D structure","embedded liquid metal electrode","passive tunable layer","mechanically tunable layer","air cavity","micropillar array geometric support","membrane","soft lithography fabrication method","casting","multiple functional layer fusion","soft polymer substrate","numerical simulation","wearable electronics","healthcare application","robotics application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tactile sensing","soft lithography","wearability","capacitance","multi-layer"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assemblies of Microfluidic Channels and Micropillars Facilitate Sensitive and Compliant Tactile Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7637025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","displayDocTitle":"Assemblies of Microfluidic Channels and Micropillars Facilitate Sensitive and Compliant Tactile Sensing","htmlLink":"/document/7637025/","accessionNumber":"16482180","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2016","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1446752 and 1527709"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assemblies of Microfluidic Channels and Micropillars Facilitate Sensitive and Compliant Tactile Sensing","sourcePdf":"jsen-visell-2618784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062835S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7747553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7747553","articleId":"7637025","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7637036,"authors":[{"name":"Rian Ferdian","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7874231/7637036/ferdi-2617286-small.gif","p":["Rian Ferdian received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Tekonologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

But CS implementation has a drawback of high computational complexity due to calculation between large size of matrices. In this paper, we will propose a low-complexity CS hardware realization for channel estimation in the integrated services digital broadcasting-terrestrial (ISDB-T) system using several optimization methods to reduce the implementation complexity of CS usage. Since the ISDB-T is based on orthogonal frequency division and multiplexing system, the measurement matrix of CS computation is a truncated discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. We can exploit the symmetrical property of this DFT matrix to significantly reduce its multiplication complexity and random access memory usage. To achieve fast reconstruction period, this paper also provides a hardware architecture for the proposed method and its realization in field programmable gate array. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can achieve lower complexity CS-based channel estimation with almost the identical system performance with the conventional method. Moreover, the realized hardware can achieve the fastest execution time compare to that of other existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2016.2617286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7874231/07637036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2016.2617286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874231","startPage":"92","endPage":"102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity Hardware Implementation of Compressed Sensing-Based Channel Estimation for ISDB-T System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7637036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Hardware Implementation of Compressed Sensing-Based Channel Estimation for ISDB-T System","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723037","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7637036/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity Hardware Implementation of Compressed Sensing-Based Channel Estimation for ISDB-T System","sourcePdf":"tbc-ferdian-2617286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106428S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7874231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7874231","articleId":"7637036","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7637042,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos M.

In Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, the definition of multimedia broadcast services over a common radio channel addresses the shortage of radio resources but introduces the problem of network error recovery. In order to address network errors on LTE multimedia broadcast services, the current standards propose the combined use of forward error correction and unicast recovery techniques at the application level. This paper shows how to efficiently synchronize the broadcasting server and the multimedia players and how to reduce service latency by limiting the multimedia player buffer length. This is accomplished by analyzing the relation between the different parameters of the LTE multimedia broadcast service, the multimedia player buffer length, and service interruptions. A case study is simulated to confirm how the quality of the multimedia service is improved by applying our proposals.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2016.2620605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7782804/07637042.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2016.2620605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7782804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","startPage":"173","endPage":"182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reducing Latency for Multimedia Broadcast Services Over Mobile Networks","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7637042/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16581435","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","grantNumber":"TEC2015-67834-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Latency for Multimedia Broadcast Services Over Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"tmm-lentiscosanchez-2620605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057857S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7782804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7782804","articleId":"7637042","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7637043,"authors":[{"name":"Abdolmehdi Dadgarpour","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7769172/7637043/dadga-2620522-small.gif","p":["Abdolmehdi Dadgarpour (M\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from Azad University of Jahrom, Fars, Iran, in 2005, the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from Azad University Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from the Energy, Materials, and Telecommunications Center at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, University of Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2015.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al.

Next, based on a general linear fusion rule, the statistics of the global test summary are derived and the sensing quality is characterized in terms of the probability of false alarm and probability of detection. Then, the optimization of the overall detection performance is formulated according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion (NPC) and it is discussed that the optimization required is indeed a decision-making process with uncertainty which incurs prohibitive computational complexity. The NPC is then modified to achieve a good affordable solution by using semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques and it is shown that this new solution is nearly optimal according to the deflection criterion. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and its associated SDP is demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2620465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07637047.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2620465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Interruptions in Cooperation for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7637047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Random Interruptions in Cooperation for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637047/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16598307","htmlLink":"/document/7637047/","volume":"65","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Doctoral Program in Computing and Mathematical Sciences"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Interruptions in Cooperation for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-abdi-2620465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152858S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7637047","onlineDate":"24 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7637091,"authors":[{"name":"Julia Nilsson","affiliation":["The Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","The Department of Active Safety, Volvo Car Group, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5117645/7637076/7637091/7637091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julia Nilsson received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2011.

To extend the capability of current advanced driver assistance systems, and eventually progress to highly automated highway driving, the task of automatically determine if, when, and how to perform a lane change maneuver, is essential. This paper thereby presents a low-complexity lane change maneuver algorithm which determines whether a lane change maneuver is desirable, and if so, selects an appropriate inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to perform the maneuver, and calculates the corresponding longitudinal and lateral control trajectory. The ability of the proposed lane change maneuver algorithm to make appropriate maneuver decisions and generate smooth and safe lane change trajectories in various traffic situations is demonstrated by simulation and experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7637076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5117645/7637076/07637091.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MITS.2016.2565718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITS.2016.2565718","startPage":"68","endPage":"78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"If, When, and How to Perform Lane Change Maneuvers on Highways","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7637091/","displayDocTitle":"If, When, and How to Perform Lane Change Maneuvers on Highways","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7637091/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16411153","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"winter 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"If, When, and How to Perform Lane Change Maneuvers on Highways","sourcePdf":"08mits04-nilsson-2565718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116124S","chronDate":"winter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5117645","isNumber":"7637076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5117645","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7637076","articleId":"7637091","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7637094,"authors":[{"name":"Zhilu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5117645/7637076/7637094/7637094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhilu Chen received the B.E. degree in microelectronics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Worcester, MA in 2013.

This paper presents a novel approach that combines computer vision and machine learning techniques for accurate detection and classification of different types of traffic lights, including green and red lights both in circular and arrow forms. Initially, color extraction and blob detection are employed to locate the candidates. Subsequently, a pretrained PCA network is used as a multiclass classifier to obtain frame-by-frame results. Furthermore, an online multiobject tracking technique is applied to overcome occasional misses and a forecasting method is used to filter out false positives. Several additional optimization techniques are employed to improve the detector performance and handle the traffic light transitions. When evaluated using the test video sequences, the proposed system can successfully detect the traffic lights on the scene with high accuracy and stable results. Considering hardware acceleration, the proposed technique is ready to be integrated into advanced driver assistance systems or self-driving vehicles. We build our own data set of traffic lights from recorded driving videos, including circular lights and arrow lights in different directions.
