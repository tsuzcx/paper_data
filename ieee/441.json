Although this difficulty can be countered by the successive use of several models (one to model structure vibrations, an other to simulate acoustic propagation), the purpose of this work is to develop a single numerical algorithm which enables to accurately simulate both the generation of acoustic waves in a piezoelectric transducer and their propagation in the surrounding media. The pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm is used to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves, as stability and high accuracy can be achieved from as few as two nodes per wavelength. But the electric field can not be calculated with this method. That is why piezoelectricity is implemented using a finite-difference (FD) representation, resulting in an hybrid FD-PSTD model which retains the advantages of both methods. The axisymmetrical computation of the algorithm is exposed and the results obtained for the simulation of HF transducers are found to be in agreement with those of the FE algorithm of ATILA\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">reg</sup>\n software.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.430","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4409572/4409573/04410003.pdf","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4409573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P2I-9 Modeling of Axisymetrical Transducer Configurations Based on Pseudospectral/Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410003/","displayDocTitle":"P2I-9 Modeling of Axisymetrical Transducer Configurations Based on Pseudospectral/Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9854651","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410003/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P2I-9 Modeling of Axisymetrical Transducer Configurations Based on Pseudospectral/Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"P2I-9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067776S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4409572","isNumber":"4409573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4409572","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4409573","articleId":"4410003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4410064,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Multiple frequencies are used to spread the signal bandwidth, and act as an identification for a given tag or sensor and to provide signal processing gain. These attributes make this approach very useful in a multi-sensor environment allowing for better coding and lower loss SAW tags and sensors. The use of long reflector banks increases reflectivity and decreases the tag insertion loss; however, this also results in a time response that is much longer than the nominal chip grating time length. With the use of longer gratings the inter-symbol interference is increased thus resulting in distortion of adjacent frequency reflector responses. The multi-tone frequencies presented here, reduce the inter-symbol interference for long reflectors by design, such that the nulls of adjacent chip frequencies coincide. The chip lengths can be modulated to adjust for the decreased transition bandwidths thus resulting in pulse width modulation within the bit. In this paper the optimization of tag design parameters, such as number of electrodes in each reflector chip, reflectivity per strip, tag bandwidth, chip orthogonality conditions and correlation properties will be discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4409572/4409573/04410098.pdf","startPage":"2087","endPage":"2090","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4409573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P4J-1 Design Parameters for SAW Multi-Tone Frequency Coded Reflectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface acoustic waves","Pulse width modulation","Reflectivity","Bandwidth","Frequency diversity","Signal processing","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Gratings","Interference","Surface acoustic wave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","intersymbol interference","pulse width modulation","surface acoustic wave sensors","surface acoustic wave signal processing","ultrasonic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAW device design parameters","SAW multitone frequency coded reflectors","chip reflector orthogonality","code diversity","signal bandwidth spreading","signal processing gain","multisensor environment","SAW tags","SAW sensors","tag insertion loss","intersymbol interference","frequency reflector response distortion","chip frequency nulls","transition bandwidth","pulse width modulation","tag design parameter optimization","reflector chip electrodes","strip reflectivity","tag bandwidth","chip orthogonality condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"P4J-1 Design Parameters for SAW Multi-Tone Frequency Coded Reflectors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410098/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9854744","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P4J-1 Design Parameters for SAW Multi-Tone Frequency Coded Reflectors","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"P4J-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027499S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4409572","isNumber":"4409573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4409572","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4409573","articleId":"4410098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4410118,"authors":[{"name":"M.

QUS for the characterization of this multiscale material is currently confined to wave velocity analysis. Additional parameters such as broadband ultrasonic attenuation (BUA) may help to gain deeper insight for cortical bone evaluation. However, the frequency dependence of attenuation has been sparsely investigated in cortical bone. The present study focuses on the feasibility of measurements of the slope of the frequency dependent attenuation coefficient in bovine cortical bone. BUA measurements are compared to other bone properties obtained following a multimodal approach. Samples are cut along the bone axis and circumference from three 36-month old bovine femurs. Ultrasonic measurements are performed in transmission using self-made PVDF transducers. BUA is evaluated for each sample between 3.5 and 4.5 MHz in three perpendicular directions. In addition, Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is assessed using a dual X-ray absorptiometry device. The microstructure of each sample is assessed with optical microscopy, allowing a classification of the samples into 4 groups: Haversian (H, osteons diameter 150~300 mum, pores size: 20~50 mum), plexiform (PI, lamellae thickness: 100~200 mum, pores size 8~12 mum), porotic (Po, largest pores size: 50~100 mum) and mixed microstructure (M). BUA is found to depend significantly on the anatomical location, propagation direction and microstructure. The distribution of BUA values according to the microstructure is similar to the pores size distribution, indicating that scattering regime is one of the important factors affecting attenuation. Axial BUA is significantly lower than radial and tangential BUA, which may also be explained by scattering effects, since osteons and lamellae are oriented in the axial direction. The Figure shows that axial BUA is significantly correlated to BMD. However, for plexiform samples, BUA is not correlated to BMD. In these samples with fewer pores, BUA seems to be affected by viscoelasticity, reflecting microscopic bone quality. Our results suggest that attenuation could be used as a complementary index of cortical bone status.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P5A-4 Broadband Ultrasonic Attenuation in Femoral Bovine Cortical Bone is an Indicator of Bone Properties","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.545","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4409572/4409573/04410118.pdf","startPage":"2167","endPage":"2170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4409573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"P5A-4 Broadband Ultrasonic Attenuation in Femoral Bovine Cortical Bone is an Indicator of Bone Properties","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410118/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9854765","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P5A-4 Broadband Ultrasonic Attenuation in Femoral Bovine Cortical Bone is an Indicator of Bone Properties","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"P5A-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051788S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4409572","isNumber":"4409573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4409572","xplore-issue":"4409573","articleId":"4410118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4410141,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Our high operating frequencies also permit centimeter-scale cross-range resolution at several-meter standoff distances without large apertures. Scanning of a single-pixel transceiver enables targets to be rapidly mapped in three dimensions, and here we apply this technology to the detection of concealed objects on persons.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High-resolution imaging","Radar imaging","Frequency","Lighting","Radar detection","Phase detection","Schottky diodes","Bandwidth","Apertures","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","FM radar","radar detection","radar imaging","radar resolution","Schottky diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution imaging radar","phase-sensitive detection","all-solid-state design","Schottky diode sensors","frequency-modulated continuous wave radar technique","centimeter-scale range resolution","single-pixel transceiver","coherent illumination","frequency 580 GHz","frequency 576 GHz to 589 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW)","submillimeter radar","terahertz (THz) imaging","terahertz (THz) radar"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410239","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2007.912049","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4418419/04410239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2007.912049","startPage":"64","endPage":"66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Resolution Imaging Radar at 580 GHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High-Resolution Imaging Radar at 580 GHz","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410239/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4410239/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756606","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Resolution Imaging Radar at 580 GHz","sourcePdf":"18lmwc01-cooper.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091509S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4418419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"4418419","articleId":"4410239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4410256,"authors":[{"name":"Tai-Wen Yue","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tai-Wen","lastName":"Yue","id":"37086470467"},{"name":"Zou Zhong Lee","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zou Zhong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37825682200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3015-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3015-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"}],"articleNumber":"4410256","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computer science","Acoustic noise","Colored noise","Artificial intelligence","Neurons","Signal to noise ratio","NP-hard problem","Graph theory","Operations research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph colouring","neural nets","quantum theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Q'tron neural-network approach","graph coloring problems","known-energy system","local-minima-free","goal-directed search","DSATUR algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410256","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel methodology to solve the graph coloring problem (GCP) using the Q'tron neural- network (NN) model.

Consider k-GCP as a goal to solve a GCP using at most k different colors. By continuously refining our goal, i.e., decreasing the value k, we can then 'demand' the NN to fulfill better and better goals progressively.

The second is a test system that uses the CFG for automatically generating test data based on evolutionary computing. The latter system utilises a specially designed genetic algorithm to produce the set of test cases satisfying the selected coverage criterion.

Simulation results show that this modification of conjugate gradient is more effective than the original CG in four applications using three different recurrent network architectures.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2007.126","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410240/4410339/04410409.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"381","displayPublicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence(ICTAI 2007)","publicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence(ICTAI 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2007.126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Nonmonotone Conjugate Gradient Training Algorithm for Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Nonmonotone Conjugate Gradient Training Algorithm for Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9894601","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4410409/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Nonmonotone Conjugate Gradient Training Algorithm for Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Patras, Greece","sourcePdf":"30150374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109479S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410240","isNumber":"4410339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410240","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4410339","articleId":"4410409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4410414,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Ampazis","affiliation":["Department of Financial and Management Engineering, University of Aegean, Chios, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Ampazis","id":"37443932500"},{"name":"Helen Iakovaki","affiliation":["Department of Financial and Management Engineering, University of Aegean, Chios, Greece"],"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Iakovaki","id":"37828532900"},{"name":"George Dounias","affiliation":["Department of Financial and Management Engineering, University of Aegean, Chios, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Dounias","id":"37323140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3015-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3015-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"}],"articleNumber":"4410414","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410414","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic mail","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Support vector machines","Multi-layer neural network","Support vector machine classification","Cost function","Management training","Text categorization","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","electronic mail","electronic messaging","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["author identification","e-mail message","feedforward neural network","OLMAM algorithm","optimized Levenberg-Marquardt with adaptive momentum","classification problem","Enron corpus"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2007.165","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410240/4410339/04410414.pdf","publicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence(ICTAI 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence(ICTAI 2007)","startPage":"413","endPage":"417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2007.165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Author Identification of E-mail Messages with OLMAM Trained Feedforward Neural Networks","abstract":"The OLMAM algorithm (optimized Levenberg-Marquardt with adaptive momentum) is a variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for training multilayer feedforward neural networks.

From this framework, we propose a new manifold learning technique called discriminant locally linear embedding (DLLE), in which the local geometric properties within each class are preserved according to the locally linear embedding (LLE) criterion, and the separability between different classes is enforced by maximizing margins between point pairs on different classes. To deal with the out-of-sample problem in visual recognition with vector input, the linear version of DLLE, i.e., linearization of DLLE (DLLE/L), is directly proposed through the graph-embedding framework. Moreover, we propose its multilinear version, i.e., tensorization of DLLE, for the out-of-sample problem with high-order tensor input. Based on DLLE, a procedure for gait recognition is described. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both gait and face recognition, and observe that: 1) DLLE along its linearization and tensorization outperforms the related versions of linear discriminant analysis, and DLLE/L demonstrates greater effectiveness than the linearization of LLE; 2) algorithms based on tensor representations are generally superior to linear algorithms when dealing with intrinsically high-order data; and 3) for human gait recognition, DLLE/L generally obtains higher accuracy than state-of-the-art gait recognition algorithms on the standard University of South Florida gait database.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.911536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4468809/04410447.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.911536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminant Locally Linear Embedding With High-Order Tensor Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant Locally Linear Embedding With High-Order Tensor Data","volume":"38","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9918530","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","pubMedId":"18348919","htmlLink":"/document/4410447/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant Locally Linear Embedding With High-Order Tensor Data","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb02-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121545S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4468809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"4468809","articleId":"4410447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4410449,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Ming Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Research Center of Information and Control, Dalian, University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Xi-Ming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37534904400"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Research Center of Information and Control, Dalian, University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280461100"},{"name":"Guo-Ping Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK"],"firstName":"Guo-Ping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37281349700"},{"name":"Jun Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292067100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4410449","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":205,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1951},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"abstract":"This correspondence considers the stability problem for a class of linear switched systems with time-varying delay in the sense of Hurwitz convex combination. The bound of derivative of the time-varying delay can be an unknown constant. It is concluded that the stability result for linear switched systems still holds for such systems with time-varying delay under a certain delay bound. Moreover, the delay bound of guaranteeing system stability can be easily obtained based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As a special case, when the time-varying delay becomes constant, the criterion obtained in this correspondence is less conservative than existing ones. The reason for less conservativeness is also explicitly explained in this correspondence.

A more general model for active visual positioning using two cameras without a neck is also investigated. The position of an object can be computed via the active motions. The presented model is less sensitive to the intrinsic parameters of cameras, which promises more flexibility in many applications such as visual tracking with changeable focusing. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.912082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4468809/04410451.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.912082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Active Visual System for Humanoid Robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410451/","displayDocTitle":"A New Active Visual System for Humanoid Robots","volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918540","pubMedId":"18348917","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410451/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Active Visual System for Humanoid Robots","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb02-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105985S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4468809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4468809","articleId":"4410451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4410452,"authors":[{"name":"Maximiliano O.

The paper analyses design issues associated to matching and process variations for the chosen filter topology and constituent transconductor block. The design equations justify the choice of both when the main constraints are robustness and power. The sixth order, bandpass filter prototype consumes 70 nW of power, with a dynamic range greater than 47 dB and operates at 1-V power supply. The filter was designed as part of a wearable breathing detector but its wide programmability range makes it suitable for many other biomedical sensor interfaces that require steep low frequency rejection band as well as ultralow power and low voltage operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4432383/04410456.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2007.913129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2007.913129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nanopower Bandpass Filter for Detection of an Acoustic Signal in a Wearable Breathing Detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic signal detection","Band pass filters","Detectors","Robustness","Biomedical acoustics","Signal processing","MOSFETs","Matched filters","Topology","Transconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","bioacoustics","biomedical measurement","intelligent sensors","medical signal detection","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanopower bandpass filter","acoustic signal detection","wearable breathing detector","filter topology","wearable electronics","wireless intelligent sensors","biomedical applications","power 70 nW","voltage 1 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandpass filter","breathing","low power analog","weak inversion","wearable electronics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Nanopower Bandpass Filter for Detection of an Acoustic Signal in a Wearable Breathing Detector","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4410456/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748141","pubMedId":"23852410","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nanopower Bandpass Filter for Detection of an Acoustic Signal in a Wearable Breathing Detector","sourcePdf":"01tbcas03-corbishley.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118443S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4432383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4432383","articleId":"4410456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4410457,"authors":[{"name":"Tia Gao","affiliation":["Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, Laurel, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tia Gao received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from John Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, in 2006, where she is currently a graduate student.","She was the Project Manager of the Advanced Health and Disaster Aid Network while working at John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

These lightweight medical systems can aid providers in large disasters who become overwhelmed with the large number of patients, limited resources, and insufficient information. In a mass casualty incident, small embedded medical systems facilitate patient care, resource allocation, and real-time communication in the advanced health and disaster aid network (AID-N). We present the design of electronic triage tags on lightweight, embedded systems with limited memory and computational power. These electronic triage tags use noninvasive, biomedical sensors (pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure cuff) to continuously monitor the vital signs of a patient and deliver pertinent information to first responders. This electronic triage system facilitates the seamless collection and dissemination of data from the incident site to key members of the distributed emergency response community. The real-time collection of data through a mesh network in a mass casualty drill was shown to approximately triple the number of times patients that were triaged compared with the traditional paper triage system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4432383/04410457.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2007.910901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2007.910901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Advanced Health and Disaster Aid Network: A Light-Weight Wireless Medical System for Triage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","Embedded system","Patient monitoring","Real time systems","Resource management","Biomedical computing","Embedded computing","Biosensors","Blood pressure","Mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","biomedical telemetry","blood pressure measurement","electrocardiography","mesh generation","oximetry","patient monitoring","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light-weight wireless medical system","semiconductor technology","electronic triage tags","real-time data collection","mesh network","biomedical monitoring","multisensor systems","biomedical sensors","pulse oximeter","electrocardiogram","blood pressure cuff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","emergency services","human factors","multisensor systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"The Advanced Health and Disaster Aid Network: A Light-Weight Wireless Medical System for Triage","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4410457/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748142","pubMedId":"23852414","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Advanced Health and Disaster Aid Network: A Light-Weight Wireless Medical System for Triage","sourcePdf":"01tbcas03-gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094588S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4432383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4432383","articleId":"4410457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4410458,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Blake Vance","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/4456726/4410458/4410458-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jonathan Blake Vance (M'05) was born January 26, 1981 in Metairie, LA.

Past literature suggests that operating an engine under such lean conditions can significantly reduce NO emissions by as much as 30% and improve fuel efficiency by as much as 5%-10%. At lean conditions, the heat release per engine cycle is not close to constant, as it is when these engines operate under stoichiometric conditions where the equivalence ratio is 1.0. A neural network controller employing output feedback has shown ability in simulation to reduce the nonlinear cyclic dispersion observed under lean operating conditions. This neural network (NN) output controller consists of three NNs: a) an NN observer to estimate the states of the engine such as total fuel and air; b) a second NN for generating virtual input; and c) a third NN for generating actual control input. The uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals is demonstrated by using the Lyapunov analysis without using the separation principle. Persistency of the excitation condition, the certainty equivalence principle, and the linearity in the unknown parameter assumptions are also relaxed. The controller is implemented for a research engine as a program running on an embeddable PC that communicates with the engine through a custom hardware interface, and the results are similar to those observed in simulation. Experimental results at an equivalence ratio of 0.77 show a drop in NO emissions by around 98% from stoichiometric levels with an improvement of fuel efficiency by 5%. A 30% drop in unburned hydrocarbons from uncontrolled case is observed at this equivalence ratio of 0.77. Similar performance was observed with the controller on a different engine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9811982","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4410458/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Output Feedback Controller for Operation of Spark Ignition Engines at Lean Conditions Using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output Feedback Controller for Operation of Spark Ignition Engines at Lean Conditions Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"16tcst02-vance.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08742S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4456726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4456726","articleId":"4410458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4410463,"authors":[{"name":"Weifeng Liu","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4410463/4410463-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weifeng Liu (S'06) was born in Shanghai, China.

This result is the main contribution of the paper and enhances the present understanding of the LMS algorithm with a machine learning perspective. The effect of the KLMS step size is also studied from the viewpoint of regularization. Two experiments are presented to support our conclusion that with finite data the KLMS algorithm can be readily used in high dimensional spaces and particularly in RKHS to derive nonlinear, stable algorithms with comparable performance to batch, regularized solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.907881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4432769/04410463.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.907881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Kernel Least-Mean-Square Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"The Kernel Least-Mean-Square Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410463/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9748117","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410463/","volume":"56","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Kernel Least-Mean-Square Algorithm","sourcePdf":"56tsp02-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189847S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4432769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"408","xplore-issue":"4432769","articleId":"4410463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4410464,"authors":[{"name":"Qianchuan Zhao","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4410464/4410464-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qianchuan Zhao (M'06) received the B.E. degree in automatic control, the B.S. degree in applied mathematics, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and its applications, all from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1992, 1992, and 1996, respectively.","He is currently a Professor and the Associate Director of the Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems (CFINS) in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

The performance of conventional interferometric ISAR imaging system using three antennas is poor, as the positions of scatterers, which have the same range-Doppler value and projected onto the ISAR plane as a synthesis scatterer, cannot be correctly estimated. However, by using two antenna arrays perpendicular to each other, the system's ability to separate these scatterers can be improved. The criterion for the selection of a range unit that contains an isolated scatterer in the 2-D array domain for doing motion compensation is discussed. If there is no range unit which contains only an isolated scatterer, then radial and cross-range motion compensation has to be carried out by motion parameter estimation. Two cross-range motion parameters measurement algorithms, one based on array processing of the range profile and another based on correlation of ISAR images of different antennas, are proposed. The coordinates registration problem for the scatterers of a synthesis scatterer is also discussed. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.909946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4432701/04410504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.909946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432701","startPage":"504","endPage":"515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional ISAR Imaging Based on Antenna Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional ISAR Imaging Based on Antenna Array","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9999754","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4410504/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional ISAR Imaging Based on Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"46tgrs02-ma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076828S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4432701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4432701","articleId":"4410504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4410505,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Pinel","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nantes Atlantique (IREENA) Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique de l''Universit\u00e9 d Nantes, University of Nantes, Nantes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4432701/4410505/4410505-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicolas Pinel was born in Saint-Brieuc, France, in 1980.

The classical technique works well in the design of lead-lag compensators for SISO controllers. But, there is no proper step-by-step procedure to achieve the desired performance characteristics for a MISO controller. Hence, in this paper, a computational optimization tool has been used to determine the optimal gains and time constants of a linear MISO damping controller.

An inventory of one million PHEVs was used and charging was begun in early evening and later at night for comparison. Different connection power levels of 1.4 kW, 2 kW, and 6 kW were used. The results include the impact on capacity requirements, fuel types, generation technologies, and emissions. Cost information such as added cost of generation and cost savings versus use of gasoline were calculated. Preliminary results of the expansion of the study to all regions of the country are also presented. The results show distinct differences in fuels and generating technologies when charging times are changed. At low specific power and late in the evening, coal was the major fuel used, while charging more heavily during peak times led to more use of combustion turbines and combined cycle plants.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 iREP Symposium - Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - VII.

The algorithms use three signal processing engines, namely, Prony's method, matrix pencil method and Hankel total least squares (HTLS) method. Results from these engines are processed using a custom developed set of rules for handling the complexities of modal analysis from real-time PMU measurements. The results are illustrated on several actual PMU recordings from power systems in North America. A simple powerful control design is also explored to initiate a supplementary HVDC modulation scheme to damp out inter-area oscillations when the oscillation monitoring system detects poorly damped oscillations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4410548/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9859335","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Oscillation monitoring system based on wide area synchrophasors in power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillation monitoring system based on wide area synchrophasors in power systems","confLoc":"Charleston, SC","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.196238S","chronDate":"19-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410506","isNumber":"4410507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410506","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4410507","articleId":"4410548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4410550,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Qiao","affiliation":["Intelligent Power Infrastructure Consortium School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Qiao","id":"37087190950"},{"name":"Ronald G.

The standard FACTS controllers are linear controllers designed around a specific operating point from a linearized system model with fixed parameters. However, at other operating points their performance degrades. Neural-network-based nonlinear intelligent control offers an attractive approach to overcome the drawbacks of the linear controllers. This paper presents two different neural-network-based intelligent control architectures, i.e., indirect adaptive neurocontrol and adaptive critic design based optimal neurocontrol, for designing the external control of an SSSC FACTS device. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the proposed nonlinear intelligent controllers on single machine infinite bus as well as multi-machine power systems. Results show that the proposed intelligent controls improve the dynamic performance of the SSSC and the associated power network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410550/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9859336","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410550/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"19-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based intelligent control for improving dynamic performance of FACTS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based intelligent control for improving dynamic performance of FACTS devices","confLoc":"Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081149S","chronDate":"19-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410506","isNumber":"4410507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410506","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410507","articleId":"4410550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4410563,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Karimi","affiliation":["Advanced Power & Electricity Research Center, West Virginia University Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Karimi","id":"37064454000"},{"name":"Ali Feliachi","affiliation":["Advanced Power & Electricity Research Center, West Virginia University Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Feliachi","id":"37265819500"},{"name":"Muhammad A.

During parameter estimation, only the parameters playing very important roles in the dynamics of the composite load model are estimated, while the other parameters playing limited role are set as the default values which is obtained by the component based method.

Two design examples are given to illustrate the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/ISITC.2007.17","startPage":"198","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Information Technology Convergence (ISITC 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITC.2007.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410586","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Information Technology Convergence (ISITC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410585/4410586/04410634.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of 2-D FIR Half-Band Filters Using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410634/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of 2-D FIR Half-Band Filters Using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410634/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9895015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"23-24 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of 2-D FIR Half-Band Filters Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Jeonju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30450198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041215S","chronDate":"23-24 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410585","isNumber":"4410586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410585","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410586","articleId":"4410634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4410636,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongfei Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiongfei","lastName":"Tao","id":"37591468100"},{"name":"Jong-man Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electricity, Applied Computer, Namdo Provincial College, Jeonnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-man","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068780300"},{"name":"Weizhong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Weizhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598758000"},{"name":"Li Kong","affiliation":["Department of Control Science & Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Kong","id":"37824803200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3045-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3045-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4410636","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Lattices","Iterative algorithms","Iterative decoding","Computational geometry","Information geometry","Information technology","Energy conversion","Educational institutions","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity-check code","parity check matrix","quasicyclic structure","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we construct a class of LDPC codes with girth 10 based on 2-D lattices.

The codes are regular, whose column weight is 3. The generated check matrix have quasi-cyclic structure, and the codes show excellent bit error rate(BER) performance over A WGN channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISITC.2007.56","publicationTitle":"2007

It is widely used in networking applications which involve the packet header/content inspection. To provide fast membership query operation, this data structure resides in the main memory in most of its applications. Each membership query consists hashing for a set of memory addresses and memory accesses at these locations. In this paper, we propose a new design of Bloom filter in which every two memory addresses are squeezed into one I/O block of the main memory. With the burst-type data I/O capability in the contemporary DRAM design, the total number of memory I/O's involved in the membership query is reduced by half. Therefore, the average query delay can be reduced significantly. The cost of using this new design is a negligible increment of false positive rate as shown by both analysis and simulation.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.8","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04410918.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Design of Bloom Filter for Packet Inspection Speedup","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Design of Bloom Filter for Packet Inspection Speedup","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823157","htmlLink":"/document/4410918/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Design of Bloom Filter for Packet Inspection Speedup","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06872S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4410918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4410924,"authors":[{"name":"Morten Lisborg Jorgensen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Morten Lisborg","lastName":"Jorgensen","id":"37839771000"},{"name":"Boyan Radkov Yanakiev","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Boyan Radkov","lastName":"Yanakiev","id":"37540562300"},{"name":"Gunvor Elisabeth Kirkelund","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Gunvor Elisabeth","lastName":"Kirkelund","id":"37591175400"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Yomo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Yomo","id":"37296388400"},{"name":"Torben Larsen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Torben","lastName":"Larsen","id":"37271924000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4410924","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system security","Interference","Information security","Decoding","Peer to peer computing","Wireless networks","Error analysis","Cryptography","Channel capacity","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message authentication","radio links","radio networks","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical-layer security","wireless network","communication secrecy","wireless link","decoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a physical-layer security scheme for wireless networks, aiming to achieve communication secrecy by making the eavesdropper incapable of decoding the secret wireless message. The considered scenario features one user within the range of two access points, API and AP2. The APs are assumed to be connected through an alternative secure (e.g. wired) connection. The goal is to secure the wireless link between the user and API. While the user transmits to API, AP2 simultaneously transmits an interfering signal, which is a priori provided to API, such that API is likely the only node capable of decoding the user's entire transmission. Evaluation is done through simulation by measuring the upper bound of the information-theoretic secrecy and error performance. In the latter case it is shown that the eavesdropper experiences significantly higher error rates than the intended receiver, thus providing evidence of practical security.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.14","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04410924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"33","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shout to Secure: Physical-Layer Wireless Security with Known Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shout to Secure: Physical-Layer Wireless Security with Known Interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410924/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823163","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4410924/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shout to Secure: Physical-Layer Wireless Security with Known Interference","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A02P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126426S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4410924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4410943,"authors":[{"name":"Song Liu","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310595800"},{"name":"Larry J.

The overhead medium-voltage (MV) power line is modeled as a 3-phase set of parallel wires above a lossy earth. A near-exact solution, based on previous approaches for infinitely long lines, is presented for the fields from arbitrarily long lines. Emissions are computed by considering a specified BPL model of semi-infinite length, and the maximum allowable excitation voltage vs. frequency is computed by assuming compliance with FCC field strength limits. These calibration results are used to study the interference to local terrestrial services and to quantify both the theoretical capacity and practical throughputs for BPL systems operation over [2, 30] MHz and [32, 60] MHz. We conclude that practical BPL throughputs are attainable while meeting current FCC requirements, but that these limits may not be stringent enough to avoid serious interference to neighboring radio services.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.33","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04410943.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"139","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Interference Evaluation of Overhead Medium-Voltage Broadband Power Line (BPL) Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Interference Evaluation of Overhead Medium-Voltage Broadband Power Line (BPL) Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4410943/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823182","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410943/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Interference Evaluation of Overhead Medium-Voltage Broadband Power Line (BPL) Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A05P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077971S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4410943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4410966,"authors":[{"name":"Xinde Hu","affiliation":["Data Storage Systems Center, ECE Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xinde","lastName":"Hu","id":"37293049300"},{"name":"B.

In order to investigate the error floor of LDPC codes under partial response channels used in data storage systems, we propose a new estimation method combining analytical tools and simulation, based on the concept of trapping sets. The definition of trapping sets is based on the dominant error patterns observed in the decoding process. The goal is to accurately estimate the error rate in the error floor region for certain types of LDPC codes under the partial response channel and further extend the frame error rate down to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-14</sup>\n or lower. Towards this goal, we first use field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware simulation to find the trapping sets that cause the decoding failure in the error floor region. For each trapping set, we extract the parameters which are key to the decoding failure rate caused by this trapping set. Then we use a much simpler in situ hardware simulation with these parameters to obtain the conditional decoding failure rate. By considering all the trapping sets we find, we obtain the overall frame error rate in the error floor region. The estimation results for a length -4623 QC-LDPC code under the EPR4 channel are within 0.3 dB of the direct simulation results. In addition, this method allows us to estimate the frame error rate of a LDPC code down to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-14</sup>\n or lower.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.56","startPage":"259","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04410966.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Floor Estimation of Long LDPC Codes on Partial Response Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410966/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Error Floor Estimation of Long LDPC Codes on Partial Response Channels","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823205","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4410966/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Floor Estimation of Long LDPC Codes on Partial Response Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A09P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072599S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4410966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4410967,"authors":[{"name":"Ruwan N.

Rather than passing messages consisting of symbol probabilities, we pass lists of possible symbols and mark very likely symbols as verified. The density evolution (DE) equations for this decoder are derived and used to compute decoding thresholds. If the maximum list-size is unbounded, then we find that any capacity-achieving LDPC code for the binary erasure channel can be used to achieve capacity on the q-SC for large q. The decoding thresholds are also computed via DE for the case where each list is truncated to satisfy a maximum list-size constraint. The probability of false verification is considered for this case, and techniques are discussed to mitigate the problem. Optimization of the degree distribution is also used to improve the threshold for a fixed maximum list size. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with a variety of other algorithms using both density evolution thresholds and simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.60","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 -

The excessive channel information needs to be estimated at the destination, especially in the networks with mobile nodes. Channel estimation error is often inevitable. Moreover, there may be untrustworthy nodes that do not honestly forward messages. Additionally, good nodes may fail to forward messages because they move out of the transmission range. In all above scenarios, the message forwarded by a relay node may not be the same as the message broadcast by the source node. This could significantly degrade the performance of cooperative transmission. Another challenging problem is to study complicated cooperative relaying topologies with multi- hop, multiple relays. Currently, existing schemes only analyze the one-hop case possibly with multiple relays, or the multi-hop case in a single chain topology. In this paper, we propose a low-overhead self-learning cooperative transmission scheme that solves above problems. In particular, each node detects the events in which the received signal- to-noise-ratio (SNR) is greater than a threshold. The distribution of the events, which can describe reliability/trustworthiness of a relay node, is modeled as a Beta function. With a very low overhead, those Beta functions can propagate through the complicated cooperative relaying topology from the source to the destination. When the destination combines information from different paths, both mean and variance are taken into the consideration. The simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme can adapt to estimation errors, untrustworthy nodes, and node mobility. The BER performance of our proposed scheme is more than 4 times better than the traditional Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) that does not consider unreliability in relays.","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04410984.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"365","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Learning Cooperative Transmission - Coping with Unreliability Due to Mobility, Channel Estimation Errors, and Untrustworthy Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Self-Learning Cooperative Transmission - Coping with Unreliability Due to Mobility, Channel Estimation Errors, and Untrustworthy Nodes","htmlLink":"/document/4410984/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823223","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Learning Cooperative Transmission - Coping with Unreliability Due to Mobility, Channel Estimation Errors, and Untrustworthy Nodes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A12P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065764S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4410984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4410989,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Heidari","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Information Network Studies, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Heidari","id":"38184633500"},{"name":"Ferit Ozan Akgul","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Information Network Studies, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ferit Ozan","lastName":"Akgul","id":"37294609900"},{"name":"Nayef Ali Alsindi","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Information Network Studies, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Nayef Ali","lastName":"Alsindi","id":"37275182600"},{"name":"Kaveh Pahlavan","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Information Network Studies, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaveh","lastName":"Pahlavan","id":"37275246400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4410989","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4410989","abstract":"Time of Arrival (TOA) based indoor positioning systems are considered to be the high precision alternatives to other positioning systems employing received signal strength (RSS) or Angle of Arrival (AOA). However, such systems suffer from the blockage of the direct path (DP) and occurrence of undetected direct path (UDP) condition and their performance degrades drastically in such conditions. Erroneous detection of the other multipath components (MPCs) as DP, which is the indicator of the true distance between the transmitter and the receiver, will introduce substantial ranging and localization errors into the system. Therefore, identification of the occurrence of large ranging errors and absence of DP from the received radio signal is our subsequent concern. After identification, the second step is to remedy the ranging errors in such UDP conditions. In this paper we present a methodology, based on an application of artificial neural network (ANN) design, to identify the UDP conditions and mitigate the ranging error using statistics extracted from wideband frequency domain indoor measurements conducted in a typical office building. The system bandwidth used for the frequency domain measurement was 500 MHz centered around 1 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.79","startPage":"387","endPage":"392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04410989.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Assisted Identification of the Absence of Direct Path in Indoor Localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Radiofrequency identification","Artificial neural networks","Frequency domain analysis","Frequency measurement","Degradation","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Signal processing","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","frequency-domain analysis","indoor communication","neural nets","telecommunication computing","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network assisted identification","time of arrival","received signal strength","angle of arrival","direct path blockage","undetected direct path condition","multipath components","transmitter","receiver","substantial ranging","localization errors","artificial neural network","wideband frequency domain indoor measurements","frequency domain measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4410989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Assisted Identification of the Absence of Direct Path in Indoor Localization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4410989/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823228","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Assisted Identification of the Absence of Direct Path in Indoor Localization","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A12P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072964S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4410989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411014,"authors":[{"name":"Binbin Wu","affiliation":["Center for Information & Communications Technology Research, Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Binbin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37830675500"},{"name":"Brian Marchant","affiliation":["Center for Information & Communications Technology Research, Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Marchant","id":"37827686700"},{"name":"Mohsen Kavehrad","affiliation":["Center for Information & Communications Technology Research, Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Kavehrad","id":"37268175500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411014","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Optical propagation","Radio frequency","Optical modulation","Atmosphere","Communication networks","Telecommunication network reliability","Communication channels","Clouds","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fog","light absorption","light propagation","optical communication","optical dispersion","ray tracing","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion analysis","free-space optical communication","FSOC","heavy fog medium","infrared light","broadband application","high-rise building","intercity communication infrastructures","radio frequency communication","communication channel","propagation channel","ray tracing","2-D histogram","absorption","metropolitan","light signal attenuation","size 1.55 mum"]}],"abstract":"Free-space optical communication (FSOC) is a method by which one transmits a modulated beam of visible or infrared light through the atmosphere for broadband applications. FSOC makes connectivity possible between high-rise buildings and metropolitan and intercity communication infrastructures. While radio frequency (RF) communication still dominates the commercial communications networks, it has not been able to meet the increasing demand for larger data rates. Reliable communications require a good understanding of the surrounding environment that affects the communications channel. The fundamental limitation of FSOC arises from the environment through which light propagates. The presence of particles, such as fog and clouds in the propagation channel introduces spatial and angular dispersion to the transmitted light signals. Attenuation of the light signals through the propagation medium is a combined effect of dispersion and absorption by particles. A mode of ray tracing is developed to simulate light going through the medium. A 2-D histogram is presented to investigate correlation of spatial and angular dispersion of the received light.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.104","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"527","endPage":"531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersion Analysis of 1.55um Free-Space Optical Communications through a Heavy Fog Medium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dispersion Analysis of 1.55um Free-Space Optical Communications through a Heavy Fog Medium","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411014/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823230","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411014/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersion Analysis of 1.55um Free-Space Optical Communications through a Heavy Fog Medium","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A17P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080811S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411018,"authors":[{"name":"Radivoje Zarubica","affiliation":["Charles E.

We propose to apply the non layered and layered ZF (V-BLAST) receiver to the relay and destination terminals in coherent MIMO relay networks under two-hop half-duplex relaying. Considering the channel estimation is often imperfect due to the noise and interference, this paper assumes that no perfect channel state information (CSI) is available for both backward and forward channels. The V-BLAST receiver is extended to the imperfect CSI under the assumption that the channel estimation errors are independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and known second-order statistics. A robust symbol detection ordering criterion is proposed for applying ZF V-BLAST to the MIMO relay networks. This new ordering rule aims at providing, in each layer, the maximum average signal to interference- plus-noise ratio (SINR), over the random channel errors. Our simulations show that aided by the new ordering criterion, the suboptimal ZF operators, directly resulted from the imperfect CSI, is capable of alleviating the effect of CSI errors and improving the robustness of V-BLAST system.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.112","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411022.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"V-BLAST Receiver for MIMO Relay Networks with Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411022/","displayDocTitle":"V-BLAST Receiver for MIMO Relay Networks with Imperfect CSI","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823238","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411022/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"V-BLAST Receiver for MIMO Relay Networks with Imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"A17P09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069586S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411031,"authors":[{"name":"Masanori Takata","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shizuoka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Takata","id":"37271064700"},{"name":"Masaki Bandai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shizuoka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Bandai","id":"37268230300"},{"name":"Takashi Watanabe","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shizuoka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37280649200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411031","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Directional antennas","Deafness","Ad hoc networks","Transmitters","Peer to peer computing","Directive antennas","Mobile ad hoc networks","Wireless application protocol","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","directive antennas","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deafness avoidance","omnidirectional antennas","wireless ad hoc networks","directional MAC protocols","DMAC/DA","wait to send frames","directional request to send","clear to send","next packet notification"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MAC Protocol with Directional Antennas for Deafness Avoidance in Ad Hoc Networks","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.121","startPage":"620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411031","abstract":"Directional antennas are expected to provide significant improvements over omni-directional antennas in wireless ad hoc networks. Directional MAC protocols, however, introduce new kinds of problems arising from directivity. One major problem is deafness, caused by a lack of state information from neighbor nodes (i.e., idle or busy). This paper proposes DMAC/DA (Directional MAC with Deafness Avoidance) to overcome the deafness problem. In DMAC/DA, WTS (Wait To Send) frames are transmitted by the transmitter and the receiver after the successful exchange of directional RTS (Request To Send) and CTS (Clear To Send) to notify the on-going communication to potential transmitters that may experience deafness. Furthermore, DMAC/DA is enhanced by the next packet notification to distinguish transmitters from neighbors. We evaluate our protocol through extensive simulation study with different values of parameters such as the number of flows, data size and beamwidth. The experimental results show that DMAC/DA outperforms existing directional MAC protocols, such as DMAC (Directional MAC) and MDA (MAC protocol for Directional Antennas), in terms of throughput, RTS failure ratio, and control overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823247","htmlLink":"/document/4411031/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A MAC Protocol with Directional Antennas for Deafness Avoidance in Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MAC Protocol with Directional Antennas for Deafness Avoidance in Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"B02P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051281S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411033,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Stamatiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Stamatiou","id":"37294741100"},{"name":"John G.

Most of the existing work on cooperation focuses on the physical layer, with the aim of enhancing the capacity and the quality of a single link. In this paper we propose a cooperative protocol that melds physical, MAC and routing layers to increase the performance of a MIMO-BLAST ad hoc network, where nodes are allowed to transmit simultaneously. Nodes try to resolve in-range delivery of packets with an adaptive distributed Hybrid ARQ scheme to counteract interference from simultaneously active communications, while dynamic route selection is implemented for avoiding transmissions over links with harsh fading conditions. We assess the performance of our scheme through detailed simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411038.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"662","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Cooperative Routing and Hybrid ARQ in MIMO-BLAST Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Automatic repeat request","Ad hoc networks","Physical layer","Relays","Fading","Protocols","MIMO","Interference","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","automatic repeat request","MIMO communication","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed cooperative routing","hybrid ARQ","MIMO-BLAST ad hoc network","MAC","dynamic route selection","automatic repeat request protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Cooperative Routing and Hybrid ARQ in MIMO-BLAST Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411038/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823253","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Cooperative Routing and Hybrid ARQ in MIMO-BLAST Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"B03P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058569S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411056,"authors":[{"name":"Ayman Radwan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory (TRL) ECE Department, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Radwan","id":"37296400200"},{"name":"Hossam S.

Based on a scheme to achieve this, we characterize the phase synchronization inaccuracy caused by additive signal noise and LO phase noise. It turns out that relay phase noise only has a limited impact on the performance.

In this paper, we address this essential issue in WSNs by introducing the mobility and MIMO capability to the data sink in order to optimize the system performance. Specifically, the mobile sink moves along a pre-determined path and collects data packets at some polling stations. With a proper planning on the moving path, we can reduce the data relaying to the minimum, which effectively improves the energy efficiency and also circumvents the non-uniformity of energy consumption among sensor nodes. We also apply MIMO technique to the mobile sink by mounting multiple antennas on it, which provides a radical way to improve the system capacity. With the support of MIMO technique, the mobile sink can simultaneously collect data from multiple compatible sensors. Finally, we theoretically analyze the performance of mobile data gathering in a WSN enhanced by MIMO support, and also investigate its efficiency by simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can greatly improve the system throughput and energy efficiency with minimum additional overhead.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.162","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411072.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Data Gathering with Multiuser MIMO Technique in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411072/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Data Gathering with Multiuser MIMO Technique in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823287","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411072/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Data Gathering with Multiuser MIMO Technique in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"B09P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056685S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411100,"authors":[{"name":"Huei-Ru Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Huei-Ru Tseng received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Information Management from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

We show that Wong et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to the replay and forgery attacks and propose a lightweight dynamic user authentication scheme for WSNs. The proposed scheme not only retains all the advantages in Wong et al.'s scheme but also enhances its security by withstanding the security weaknesses and allows legitimate users to change their passwords freely.

The transmission delay-energy tradeoff is presented for the case where transmission energy varies directly with distance raised to a power and when the reported threshold is exceeded.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411108/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823322","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Delay and Energy Tradeoff in Multi-State Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay and Energy Tradeoff in Multi-State Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"B15P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126306S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4411117,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Luo","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Luo","id":"37309756500"},{"name":"Qian Zhang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289940400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411117","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Costs","Global Positioning System","Estimation error","Fault tolerance","Redundancy","Information analysis","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radionavigation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile sensor networks","node mobility","mobile inequality localization algorithm","position estimation"]}],"abstract":"Many sensor network applications exploit the mobility of sensor nodes and the location-awareness plays an important role in these applications. However, it is too expensive to equip special hardware in each sensor node for localization, thus a distributed range-free localization scheme in mobile sensor network is highly desired. Several such localization techniques have been developed but few of them consider leveraging the feature of node mobility. Leveraging node mobility, in this paper, both static constrain set by transmission range and velocity constrain set by node movement are introduced. Based on these two types of constrain, we propose a range-free mobile inequality localization (MIL) algorithm, which uses ring inequalities to restrict and estimate the possible location in numerical method. Our approach is distributed, quickly re-localizable and works well when all sensors are moving uncontrollably. We analyze the theoretical bound for the accuracy of the position estimation and the comprehensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm performs much better than the existing works.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.207","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411117.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative Distance Based Localization for Mobile Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411117/","displayDocTitle":"Relative Distance Based Localization for Mobile Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823330","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411117/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative Distance Based Localization for Mobile Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"B16P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046764S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4411151,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond H.

The operation of the secondary user is governed by its peak transmit power constraint and an average interference constraint at the primary receiver. Without restricting the sensing scheme (total received energy, or correlation etc), we characterize the power adaptation strategies that maximize the secondary user's SNR and capacity. We show that, in general, the capacity optimal power adaptation requires decreasing the secondary transmit power from the peak power to zero in a continuous fashion as the probability of the primary user being present increases. We find that power control that maximizes the SNR is binary, i.e., if there is any transmission, it takes place only at the peak power level. Numerical results for common spectrum sensing schemes show that the SNR and capacity maximizing schemes can be significantly different.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.265","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411175.pdf","startPage":"1380","endPage":"1384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Sensing and Optimal Power Control for Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411175/","displayDocTitle":"Soft Sensing and Optimal Power Control for Cognitive Radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823387","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411175/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Sensing and Optimal Power Control for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060804S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411176,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Musavian","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Musavian","id":"37284625400"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411176","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Fading","Rayleigh channels","Radio transmitters","Delay","Channel capacity","Receivers","AWGN","Interference","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","channel estimation","radio spectrum management","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity limits","spectrum-sharing channels","average interference power","imperfect feedback effect","partial channel information","Rayleigh flat-fading channel","closed-form expressions","power allocation policies","secondary transmitter","imperfect channel estimation","primary receiver"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we focus on opportunistic spectrum- sharing channels, whereby a secondary user may access the spectrum owned by a primary user as long as the average interference power, inflicted at the primary's receiver as an effect of the transmission power of the secondary user, remains below a predefined threshold, and investigate the effect of imperfect feedback on the capacity gains offered by this spectrum-sharing approach in fading environments.

This tradeoff was characterized asymptotically (SNR-> infinity) for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel by Zheng and Tse (2003). The SNR-asymptotic DMT overestimates the finite-SNR one (R. Narasimhan, 2006). In this paper, using the recent results on the size-asymptotic (in the number of antennas) outage capacity distribution, we derive and analyze the finite-SNR DMT for a broad class of channels (not necessarily Rayleigh fading). Systems with unequal number of Tx and Rx antennas exhibit qualitatively-different behavior from those with equal number of antennas: while the size-asymptotic DMT of the latter converges to the SNR- asymptotic DMT as the SNR grows, that of the former does not. However, the size-asymptotic DMT does provide an accurate approximation of the true DMT at low to moderately-high SNR, even for modest number of antennas, and hence is complementary of the SNR-asymptotic DMT of Zheng and Tse. Combining these two, a new DMT is obtained that is accurate over the whole SNR range. A number of generic properties of the DMT that hold at any SNR, for any number of antennas (i.e. not only asymptotic, either in size or in SNR) and for any fading channel are given. In particular, we demonstrate that the linear interpolation of the DMT for fractional multiplexing gain in (Zheng and Tse 2003) does not hold at finite SNR. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations validate the analysis and the conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.280","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411190.pdf","startPage":"1456","endPage":"1461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411190/","displayDocTitle":"On Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823402","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411190/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C03P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071103S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411193,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Griot","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Griot","id":"37298486500"},{"name":"Andres I.

In the current paper, we extend those results to protograph-based G-LDPC codes. That is, we first derive ensemble weight and stopping set enumerators for finite-length G-LDPC codes based on protographs, and then we consider the asymptotic case. In the weight enumerator case, the asymptotic results allow us to determine whether or not the typical minimum distance in the ensemble grows linearly with codeword length.

Simulation results are presented to illustrate the improvement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.289","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411199.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1507","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast ML Decoding for OSTFBC and QOSTFBC Coded MIMO-OFDM System with Clipping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fast ML Decoding for OSTFBC and QOSTFBC Coded MIMO-OFDM System with Clipping","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411199/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823411","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast ML Decoding for OSTFBC and QOSTFBC Coded MIMO-OFDM System with Clipping","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C05P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05794S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411200,"authors":[{"name":"Victoria Kostina","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Victoria","lastName":"Kostina","id":"37391022000"},{"name":"Sergey Loyka","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Loyka","id":"37276601300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411200","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Error analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Robustness","Transmitters","Upper bound","Fading","Performance loss","MIMO","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["V-BLAST algorithm","Monte-Carlo simulations","SNR approximation","fading","compact closed-form approximation","preset power allocation"]}],"abstract":"Comprehensive performance analysis of the unordered V-BLAST algorithm with various power allocation strategies is presented, which makes use of analytical tools and resorts to Monte-Carlo simulations for validation purposes only. High-SNR approximations for the optimized average block and total error rates are given. The SNR gain of optimization is rigorously defined and studied using analytical tools, including lower and upper bounds, high and low SNR approximations. The gain is upper bounded by the number of transmitters, for any modulation format and any type of fading This upper bound is achieved at high SNR by the considered optimization strategies. While the average optimization is less complex than the instantaneous one, its performance is almost as good at high SNR. A measure of robustness of the optimized algorithm is introduced and evaluated, including compact closed-form approximations. The optimized algorithm is shown to be robust to perturbations in individual and total transmit powers. Based on the algorithm robustness, a pre-set power allocation is suggested as a low-complexity alternative to the other optimization strategies, which exhibits only a minor loss in performance over the practical SNR range.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411200.pdf","endPage":"1513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of V-BLAST with Optimum Power Allocation","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.290","startPage":"1508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of V-BLAST with Optimum Power Allocation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411200/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823412","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411200/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of V-BLAST with Optimum Power Allocation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C05P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057105S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411201,"authors":[{"name":"Ayman Assra","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Assra","id":"37392244900"},{"name":"Walaa Hamouda","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Walaa","lastName":"Hamouda","id":"37266360300"},{"name":"Amr Youssef","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"Youssef","id":"37275707200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411201","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Frequency-selective fading channels","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Frequency","Decorrelation","Detectors","Base stations","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","receiving antennas","spread spectrum communication","time-varying channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time diversity","frequency-selective fading channels","asynchronous direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","space-time spreading system","fast-fading channels","transmit diversity scheme","transmit antenna","receive antenna","received signal quality","spatial diversity","temporal diversity","receiver side","bit-error-rate performance","uplink transmission","decorrelator detector","base station receiver","error probability","space-time spreading scheme","time-varying multipath channel"]}],"abstract":"Asynchronous direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS - CDMA) using space-time spreading system is investigated over frequency-selective fast-fading channels. The underlaying transmit diversity scheme, previously introduced in the literature, is based on two transmit and one receive antenna. It was shown that when employed in flat fast-fading channels, the received signal quality can be improved by utilizing the spatial and temporal diversities at the receiver side. Here, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the underlying system is investigated for an uplink transmission where a decorrelator detector is used at the base station receiver. In particular, we derive a closed form expression for the probability of error over frequency-selective fast-fading channels. The analytical BER is derived as a function of both the number of multipath and users. The BER results show that the space-time spreading scheme exploits both the temporal and spatial diversity in a time-varying multipath channel. The results also show the accuracy of the derived expression when compared with simulation results for different number of users.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.291","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411201.pdf","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Space-Time Diversity in CDMA Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411201/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Space-Time Diversity in CDMA Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823413","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411201/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Space-Time Diversity in CDMA Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C05P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046517S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411203,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tajer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Tajer","id":"38577078800"},{"name":"Aria Nosratinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Aria","lastName":"Nosratinia","id":"37269740500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411203","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411203","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the diversity order of single-carrier frequency domain equalizers (SC-FDE).

We associate a reliability value to each nonzero element of the code's parity-check matrix, and differentially modify this value in each iteration based on the sum of the extrinsic binary messages from the check nodes. For the tested random and finite-geometry LDPC codes, the proposed algorithm can achieve performance as close as 1.3 dB and 0.7 dB to that of belief propagation (BP) at the error rates of interest, respectively. This is while, unlike BP, the algorithm does not require the estimation of channel signal to noise ratio. Low memory and computational requirements and binary message-passing make the proposed algorithm attractive for high-speed low-power applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411210/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9823422","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Differential Binary Message-Passing LDPC Decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Differential Binary Message-Passing LDPC Decoder","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C07P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057673S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4411211,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Saeedi","affiliation":["Department of systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Saeedi","id":"37294647900"},{"name":"Amir H.

The receiver design is based on the variational Bayesian space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (VB-SAGE) method. Conceptually, the probability distribution of each user's code sequence and the probability distribution of all channel coefficients are updated in an iterative fashion. The obtained receiver, which we refer to as VB-SAGE receiver, performs iterative channel estimation, interference cancellation and single-user decoding. Even though the design is based on code sequence probabilities, only the soft decisions (mean values) and the variances of the code symbols are required for channel estimation and interference cancellation; moreover, the variances are functions of the soft decisions. These soft decisions are computed by the single-user decoders based on the outputs of the interference cancellation device. The iterative process of the VB-SAGE receiver is guaranteed to converge in the free energy. The VB-SAGE method proposed in this paper may also be used for other applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411214.pdf","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1586","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian Framework for Iterative Channel Estimation and Multiuser Decoding in Coded DS-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Channel estimation","Iterative decoding","Multiaccess communication","Parameter estimation","Iterative methods","Probability distribution","Interference cancellation","Detectors","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","channel estimation","code division multiple access","interference suppression","iterative methods","multiuser channels","spread spectrum communication","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian framework","iterative channel estimation","multiuser decoding","coded DS-CDMA","iterative receiver","channel coefficients","variational Bayesian space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian Framework for Iterative Channel Estimation and Multiuser Decoding in Coded DS-CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411214/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823425","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian Framework for Iterative Channel Estimation and Multiuser Decoding in Coded DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C07P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055087S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411215,"authors":[{"name":"M.

While the capacity expression does not directly define a valid distance metric for the design, a bound on the capacity expression can be used to formulate the quantization codebook design. We introduce a new distance metric on the Grassmanian manifold which is used to design the optimal precoder codebook. While the original formulation can be used for the (space) correlated channel model, we propose a differential codebook design in order to track changes in the channel statistics when the channel is correlated in time (or in frequency, e.g., across different tones in OFDM systems). Simulation results has shown considerable improvement through the proposed codebook design both for single user (SU-) and multiple user (MU-) MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.306","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411216.pdf","startPage":"1592","endPage":"1596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static and Differential Quantization Codebook Design for MIMO Precoding Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411216/","displayDocTitle":"Static and Differential Quantization Codebook Design for MIMO Precoding Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823427","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411216/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static and Differential Quantization Codebook Design for MIMO Precoding Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C08P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152291S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411217,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Martos-Naya","affiliation":["Department Ingenier\u00eda de Comunicaciones, Universidad de M\u00e1laga, Malaga, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Martos-Naya","id":"38272567400"},{"name":"Jose F.

In this paper, the impact of imperfect channel prediction on bit error probability (BEP) is analyzed in Rayleigh fading, taking into account the channel response variations over the frame interval. An exact closed-form expression for BEP is obtained, and we evaluate this expression assuming both time-variant and time-invariant channel models.

The focus is on linear dispersion (LD) space-time codes that are constructed to maximize the mutual information between the input of the space-time encoder and the output of the channel. While perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed at the receiver, three cases are considered for the CSI at the transmitter: 1) perfect CSI is available, 2) only statistical CSI is available, and 3) partial CSI in the form of a B-bit quantized channel information along with the statistical information is available. In all the three cases, it is shown that the optimal temporal power allocation is uniform. The optimal spatial power allocation for the case where only statistical CSI is available was studied previously in [1] where it was shown to be a nontrivial function of the spatial correlation. Here, the cases of perfect and partial CSI are studied. For the perfect CSI case, it is shown that it is optimal to excite only one spatial mode. For the partial and statistical CSI cases, the optimal allocation excites multiple modes, in general. However, it is attractive to use a low-complexity scheme that excites only the dominant spatial mode. We show that this low-complexity scheme is near-optimal in two settings: 1) large receive antenna asymptotics, and 2) for fixed antenna dimensions, when the transmit and receive covariance matrices are ill- and well-conditioned, respectively. Based on the optimal schemes for the extreme cases of perfect and statistical CSI, low-complexity spatial power allocation for the case of partial CSI is considered. Simulation results indicate that even in this case, exciting one spatial mode leads to a minimal loss in performance over the optimal spatial power allocation scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411218.pdf","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1606","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Linear Dispersion Codes Over Correlated MIMO Channels with Channel State Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","State feedback","Receiving antennas","Space time codes","Mutual information","Channel state information","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Covariance matrix","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","linear codes","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","linear dispersion codes","correlated MIMO channels","channel state feedback","space-time coding","channel state information","spatial power allocation","low-complexity scheme","covariance matrices","spatial mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Linear Dispersion Codes Over Correlated MIMO Channels with Channel State Feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411218/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823429","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation for Linear Dispersion Codes Over Correlated MIMO Channels with Channel State Feedback","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C08P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069841S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411219,"authors":[{"name":"Il Han Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Il Han","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239246100"},{"name":"Seung Young Park","affiliation":["Kangwon University, Chuncheon, Gangwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Young","lastName":"Park","id":"37280890500"},{"name":"David J.

Knowledge of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is important to obtaining this capacity gain. It is unrealistic to obtain perfect CSIT, but partial CSIT can often be made available by using some practical feedback method. Based on partial CSIT, codebook techniques have been shown to improve performance of MIMO multiuser systems. Unfortunately, the codebook design problem has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we consider a multiuser multiple antenna downlink model with unitary precoding using a codebook consisting of 2B unitary matrices. The appropriate precoding matrix is chosen from this codebook, which is known to both the basestation and the receivers. By defining and using a carefully chosen distance function, the minimum distance of the codebook is shown to relate to the average sum-rate of the unitary precoded system. From our analysis, a codebook design criterion is developed based on maximizing the minimum distance of the codebook. Then, a framework for constructing the codebook is presented to maximize this minimum distance. Monte Carlo simulation results are given to show the average sum-rate capacity performance of the proposed codebook design.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.309","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411219.pdf","startPage":"1607","endPage":"1611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Channel State Information Unitary Precoding and Codebook Design for MIMO Broadcast Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411219/","displayDocTitle":"Partial Channel State Information Unitary Precoding and Codebook Design for MIMO Broadcast Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823430","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411219/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Channel State Information Unitary Precoding and Codebook Design for MIMO Broadcast Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C08P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065594S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411220,"authors":[{"name":"Erwin Riegler","affiliation":["Forschungszentrum Telekommunikation Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Erwin","lastName":"Riegler","id":"37393194600"},{"name":"Giorgio Taricco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Taricco","id":"37269622500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411220","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Mutual information","Rician channels","MIMO","Interference","Additive noise","Receiving antennas","Physics","Rayleigh channels","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","interference","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","receiving antennas","Rician channels","statistical analysis","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order statistics","separately-correlated Rician fading MIMO channel","mutual information","multiaccess interference","transmit antenna","receive antenna","channel-state information","replica method"]}],"abstract":"The mean and variance of the mutual information of a separately-correlated Rician fading MIMO channel are derived in the presence of multi-access interference, when the number of transmit and receive antennas grows asymptotically large.

The main idea is to marginalize the posterior density for the received data exactly over the subset of the transmitted bits that are received with the lowest signal-to-noise-ratio, and then marginalize this density approximately over the remaining bits. Unlike the exact demodulator, whose complexity is huge due to the need for enumerating all possible combinations of transmitted constellation points, the proposed method has very low complexity. Additionally, its complexity is fixed, which makes it suitable for pipelined implementation.

If the channels vary with time/frequency then the X channel with single antennas (M = 1) at all nodes has 4/3 degrees of freedom. Thus, the MIMO X channel has non-integer degrees of freedom when M is not a multiple of 3. Simple zero forcing without dirty paper encoding or successive decoding, suffices to achieve the 4/3 M degrees of freedom in all cases. The key idea for the achievability of the degrees of freedom is interference alignment - i.e., signal spaces are aligned at receivers where they constitute interference while they are separable at receivers where they are desired. With equal number of antennas at all nodes, we also explore the increase in degrees of freedom when some of the messages are made available to a transmitter or receiver in the manner of cognitive radio.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411224.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1636","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of the MIMO X Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Time of arrival estimation","Frequency","Decoding","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","cognitive radio","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO X channel","multiple antenna transmitter","channel matrix","zero forcing","dirty paper encoding","decoding","cognitive radio","multiple antenna receiver","broadcast channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of the MIMO X Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411224/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823435","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom of the MIMO X Channel","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C09P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085548S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411229,"authors":[{"name":"Yonglan Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yonglan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37292651800"},{"name":"Pooi-Yuen Kam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pooi-Yuen","lastName":"Kam","id":"37280044700"},{"name":"Yan Xin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xin","id":"37293344500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411229","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Rayleigh channels","Power system relaying","Diversity reception","Detectors","Fading","Statistics","Protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","diversity reception","maximum likelihood detection","modulation","protocols","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non coherent detection","amplify-and-forward protocol","Rayleigh fading environment","multiple relay system","modulation","demodulation","near-maximum likelihood receiver","diversity combining receiver","second order statistics","non cooperative system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411229","abstract":"We consider about a multiple relay system operating under amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol and non-coherent modulation and demodulation.

In contrast to most previous research that focused on maximizing instantaneous rates using deterministic optimization techniques, we focus on maximizing ergodic rates using stochastic optimization techniques, which allow us to exploit the temporal dimension, in addition to the frequency and multiuser dimensions. Furthermore, in contrast to most previous algorithms that used greedy suboptimal heuristics with quadratic complexity, we use a dual optimization approach that resulted in a simple subcarrier, rate, and power allocation algorithm that has complexity O(MK) for an M-user, K-subcarrier OFDMA system. Surprisingly, our method is shown to result in duality gaps less than 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n in scenarios of practical interest, thereby allowing us to claim practical optimality. We present simulation results for a 3GPP-LTE system employing adaptive modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411234.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1687","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Downlink OFDMA Subcarrier, Rate, and Power Allocation with Linear Complexity to Maximize Ergodic Weighted-Sum Rates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Resource management","Gaussian noise","Bit error rate","Stochastic processes","Adaptive systems","Frequency conversion","Physical layer","Electrostatic precipitators","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal downlink OFDMA subcarrier","linear complexity","maximize ergodic weighted-sum rates","resource allocation algorithm","deterministic optimization techniques","stochastic optimization techniques","greedy suboptimal heuristics","quadratic complexity","dual optimization approach","power allocation algorithm","adaptive modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Downlink OFDMA Subcarrier, Rate, and Power Allocation with Linear Complexity to Maximize Ergodic Weighted-Sum Rates","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411234/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823445","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Downlink OFDMA Subcarrier, Rate, and Power Allocation with Linear Complexity to Maximize Ergodic Weighted-Sum Rates","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C11P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067253S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411235,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Peng","id":"37278945300"},{"name":"William E.

In the proposed algorithm, the behavior of PRs is modeled as a two-state Markov chain. Based on such a model, the optimal power and rate control strategy for each time slot is derived, which is a function of the energy level at the beginning of current time slot and the previous behavior of PRs.

We assume that the receiver has perfect CSI and the transmitter only knows the correlation matrix. The transmitter employs a quasi-orthogonal space-time block code in combination with a linear precoder; the receiver uses a linear MMSE detector. We analyze the optimal transmit precoding strategy that minimizes the average sum MSE at the receiver. We show that, as expected, the optimal precoding directions coincide with the eigenvectors of the transmit correlation matrix. The optimal power allocation, however, only supports at most 2 directions at all SNRs independent of the number of transmit antennas, which correspond to the 2 largest eigenvalues of the transmit correlation matrix. We characterize this optimal power allocation by the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. At high SNRs, the optimal allocation approaches equal power on the two supported modes. At low SNRs, the weaker mode is dropped and the precoding matrix becomes single-mode beamforming. We provide a closed-form expression characterizing this low-SNR range. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.334","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411244.pdf","startPage":"1734","endPage":"1738","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Correlation on Linear Precoding in QSTBC Coded Systems with Linear MSE Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Correlation on Linear Precoding in QSTBC Coded Systems with Linear MSE Detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411244/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823455","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Correlation on Linear Precoding in QSTBC Coded Systems with Linear MSE Detection","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C12P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065051S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411246,"authors":[{"name":"Norifumi Kamiya","affiliation":["Common Platform Software Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Norifumi","lastName":"Kamiya","id":"37297121100"},{"name":"Eisaku Sasaki","affiliation":["Mobile Wireless Network Division, NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Eisaku","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"37389172300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411246","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":186},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411246","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Throughput","Codecs","CMOS technology","Feedback","Registers","Hardware","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Microwave measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","codecs","cyclic codes","parity check codes","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes","microwave radio systems","decoder architecture","min-sum algorithm","feedback shift-registers","CMOS technology","size 0.15 mum","voltage 1.5 V","word length 4096 bit"]}],"abstract":"A novel decoder architecture is presented for quasi- cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes. The architecture implements a min-sum algorithm and uses feedback shift-registers to store all the messages exchanged within the algorithm. This shift-register-based min-sum (SRMS) decoder does not require complex interconnections between processors and registers and is amenable to a simple, high throughput hardware implementation. A codec with the SRMS decoder for high-rate codes of length 4095 bits has been fabricated with a 0.15 mum, 1.5 V CMOS technology. The decoder has a gate count of 693 K gates and achieves a throughput of 155.52 Mbps (STM-1) using high-order QAM schemes. Measurement results show that a microwave radio system employing this LDPC codec exhibits good error performance.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.336","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411246.pdf","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of High-Rate QC-LDPC Encoder/Decoder for Microwave Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of High-Rate QC-LDPC Encoder/Decoder for Microwave Radio Systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411246/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823457","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411246/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of High-Rate QC-LDPC Encoder/Decoder for Microwave Radio Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"C13P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050437S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411249,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Alvarado","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Communication Systems Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Alvarado","id":"37294736300"},{"name":"Leszek Szczecinski","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Communication Systems Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Leszek","lastName":"Szczecinski","id":"37266100600"},{"name":"Rodolfo Feick","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Communication Systems Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","Department of Electronics Engineering, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Feick","id":"37284033500"},{"name":"Luciano Ahumada","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Communication Systems Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Ahumada","id":"37293760300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411249","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit error rate","Modulation coding","Probability density function","Interleaved codes","Closed-form solution","Reliability engineering","Amplitude modulation","Signal mapping","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Gaussian processes","Gray codes","interleaved codes","modulation coding","quadrature amplitude modulation","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L-value distribution","Gray-mapped M2-QAM signals","probability density function","reliability metrics PDF","bit-interleaved coded modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Gaussian mixture approximations","uncoded bit error rate","BICM capacity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we develop formulas for the probability density function (PDF) of the reliability metrics in bit- interleaved coded modulation (BICM) for arbitrary M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-QAM) with Gray mapping.

This depletion has given rise to a newer version of the Internet protocol, internet protocol version 6 (IPv6). IPv6 provides sufficient address space to meet the predicted increase of the internet. Since IPv4 has been widely deployed, it is required that the existing IPv4 and the newly added IPv6 can co-exist and interoperate. Various mechanisms have been proposed for supporting the interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6. However, they are mostly designed for a static environment. Mobility introduces a new dimension to the problem of IPv4/IPv6 transition and interoperability. The mobility support of mobile terminals in a mixed IPv4/IPv6 environment remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze various handoff scenarios for a dual stack mobile node with a predominant IPv6 home address (DSMNv6) roaming in a mixed IPv4/IPv6 environment. We investigate how handoffs can be supported and derive the handoff procedures for all scenarios. We also design an analytical model for the handoff signaling cost analysis. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the signaling cost of various handoff scenarios. Conclusions from this study can give great insights in designing new cost-effective mobility-support mechanisms for IPv4/IPv6 transition and interoperability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signaling Cost Analysis of Handoffs in a Mixed IPv4/IPv6 Mobile Environment","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.345","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411255.pdf","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Signaling Cost Analysis of Handoffs in a Mixed IPv4/IPv6 Mobile Environment","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411255/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823466","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signaling Cost Analysis of Handoffs in a Mixed IPv4/IPv6 Mobile Environment","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"D01P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037875S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411284,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To improve the spectral efficiency we employ the concept of bit-interleaved LDPC-coded modulation based on pulse-amplitude modulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411334/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411334/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9823543","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"LDPC-Coded MIMO Optical Communication Over the Atmospheric Turbulence Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC-Coded MIMO Optical Communication Over the Atmospheric Turbulence Channel","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"F02P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052367S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4411336,"authors":[{"name":"Sarma Vangala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sarma","lastName":"Vangala","id":"37531583400"},{"name":"Hossein Pishro-Nik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Pishro-Nik","id":"38278138700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411336","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":514},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411336","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Availability","Channel coding","Error correction","Bandwidth","Throughput","Telecommunication network reliability","Design methodology","Analytical models","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","optical communication","optical links","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FSO-RF communication system","free-space optical links","optical wireless system","time-constrained high- bandwidth communication","atmospheric channel","hybrid channel coding","channel capacity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.426","endPage":"2236","startPage":"2232","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Highly Reliable FSO/RF Communication System Using Efficient Codes","abstract":"Optical wireless systems can solve many of the long standing problems of providing low-cost time-constrained high- bandwidth communication in a variety of network scenarios. But their unreliability due to variations in atmospheric channel make them the least deployed solutions so far. Achieving enterprise level reliabilities in such scenarios is difficult. Earlier solutions make use of a backup RF channel which transmits data whenever the FSO link is down. However, only one channel is operational at a time wasting the bandwidth of the other channel. Also this system faces the problem of alternate switching between both the channels in case the channel conditions vary from good to bad. In this paper, we propose a novel coding paradigm called \"Hybrid Channel Coding\" that not only optimally achieves the capacity of the combined FSO and RF channels but still provides carrier grade (99.999%) reliabilities for the FSO link. We provide the design methodology to be used in constructing Hybrid Channel Codes. Using analysis and simulation, we show that we can obtain many-fold decrease in the channel availability and maximum throughput with Hybrid Channel Codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411336/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411336/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9823545","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Highly Reliable FSO/RF Communication System Using Efficient Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Highly Reliable FSO/RF Communication System Using Efficient Codes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"F02P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106778S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411343,"authors":[{"name":"Jun He","affiliation":["Charles L.

In such networks, physical impairments are an issue and can cause calls to be blocked if a minimum quality of transmission (QoT) measured in terms of bit-error rate (BER) cannot be guaranteed for all calls, at all times. We focus on the routing component of RWA to incorporate QoT: we propose a novel RWA algorithm that finds a route based on both the network utilization and the physical impairments experienced over the tentative route. Our algorithm is fully decentralized and is shown using simulations to perform better than previously proposed algorithms on a regional-sized network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411343/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9847337","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411343/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"QoT-Aware Routing in Impairment-Constrained Optical Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoT-Aware Routing in Impairment-Constrained Optical Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"F04P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054008S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4411367,"authors":[{"name":"Kohki Ohba","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohki","lastName":"Ohba","id":"37835692800"},{"name":"Iwao Sasase","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Iwao","lastName":"Sasase","id":"37268382400"},{"name":"Takaya Miyazawa","affiliation":["Network Architecture Group, New Generation Network Research Center, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaya","lastName":"Miyazawa","id":"37281975900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411367","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"abstract":"We propose a mitigation technique of high-level multiple access interference(MAI) for multimedia optical Code- Division Multiple-Access(CDMA) systems using the optical power selector.

The performance of such a technique is analyzed in a synchronous network using orthogonal optical codes (OOC) and the results are compared with those for different receivers.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.463","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2434","endPage":"2438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Bias Compensation on the Parallel Interference Cancellation in DS-CDMA Optical Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Bias Compensation on the Parallel Interference Cancellation in DS-CDMA Optical Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411373/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823580","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Bias Compensation on the Parallel Interference Cancellation in DS-CDMA Optical Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"F09P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064389S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-28"},{"_id":4411376,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Song","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Song","id":"37305425600"},{"name":"Amitabha Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Amitabha","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37274347600"},{"name":"Byoung-Whi Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Whi","lastName":"Kim","id":"37290150800"},{"name":"Biswanath Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Biswanath","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37278576400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411376","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Thread Polling: A Dynamic Bandwidth Distribution Scheme in Long-Reach PON","abstract":"With the development of optical technology, the span of a broadband access network using passive optical network (PON) technology can be increased from today's standard of 20 km to 100 km or higher. As a result, we have the long-reach (LR) PON which not only has extended reach, but which can also support a large base of users by employing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) for its data transmissions. However, a major challenge in the LR-PON is that the propagation delay (for data as well as control signals) between the telecom central office (CO) and the end user is increased by a very significant amount. Now, traditional PON algorithms for scheduling the upstream transmission, such as dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithms, may not be sufficient; actually, they may lead to degraded performance because of the long delay of the \"control loop\" between the CO and the users. This challenge motivates us to investigate a multi-thread polling algorithm to distribute the upstream bandwidth dynamically in the LR-PON. In this study, we analyze key parameters of the algorithm, such as initiating and tuning multiple threads. We then demonstrate the algorithm's advantage to decrease the average packet delay under varying offered loads.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411376.pdf","startPage":"2450","endPage":"2454","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.466","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411376","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Passive optical networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","Telecommunication control","Scheduling algorithm","Optical fiber networks","Standards development","Data communication","Propagation delay","Centralized control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","broadband networks","optical fibre networks","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multithread polling","dynamic bandwidth distribution","long-reach PON","optical technology","broadband access network","passive optical network","wavelength-division multiplexing","propagation delay","upstream transmission scheduling","dynamic bandwidth allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411376/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Thread Polling: A Dynamic Bandwidth Distribution Scheme in Long-Reach PON","accessionNumber":"9823583","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411376/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Thread Polling: A Dynamic Bandwidth Distribution Scheme in Long-Reach PON","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"F09P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05207S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411377,"authors":[{"name":"Fuad E.

DCF is a random channel-access scheme based on carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) method and the exponential backoff procedure to reduce packet collisions. However, hidden stations still cause many collisions under CSMA/CA method because stations cannot sense each other's transmission and often send packets concurrently, resulting in significant performance degradation. Prior research has built accurate access delay model for 802.11 DCF. However, the hidden station effect on the performance has not been adequately studied. Our model generalizes the existing work on access delay modeling of 802.11 DCF for both non-saturation and saturation conditions, under the hidden-station effect.

In this paper, we develop a new packet sampling methodology based on SGS (sketch guided sampling) method called \"feedback and resources guided sampling\" (FRGS). Our FRGS scheme takes the measurement system capacity as an important parameter to adjust sampling probability, and a feedback of the flow sizes estimation instead of data streaming algorithm is used to save resources. Force sampling is also adopted to increase the accuracy of estimation of smaller flows. Experiments results show that FRGS method is more accurate than the SGS method under limited resources for estimating flow sizes.

Analysis for the loss in ergodic capacity for spatially i.i.d channels with channel estimation errors and delay (EED) is presented and validated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.528","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411438.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.528","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"2791","endPage":"2795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite Rate Feedback for Spatially and Temporally Correlated MISO Channels in the Presence of Estimation Errors and Feedback Delay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Finite Rate Feedback for Spatially and Temporally Correlated MISO Channels in the Presence of Estimation Errors and Feedback Delay","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411438/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411438/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823642","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Rate Feedback for Spatially and Temporally Correlated MISO Channels in the Presence of Estimation Errors and Feedback Delay","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103992S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411439,"authors":[{"name":"Zhefeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Zhefeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37404753300"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411439","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Decoding","Block codes","Frequency diversity","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","space-time-frequency coded MIMO-OFDM systems","multipath diversities","spatial diversities","multiple antennas","multiple OFDM symbols","single-symbol ML decoding","Chu sequence","peak-to-average power ratio","quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes"]}],"abstract":"Space-time/frequency coding (SFC) can achieve the spatial and multipath diversities for an MIMO-OFDM system by coding across subcarriers, multiple antennas, and/or multiple OFDM symbols, where an interesting method to achieve the multipath diversity is repeating across subcarriers proposed by Su et al. Lately, a family of space-time-frequency codes with single-symbol ML decoding have been proposed by Zhang et al to achieve both full spatial and multipath diversities by using orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) across multiple antennas and OFDM symbols and in the meantime repeating across the subcarriers. The main goal of this paper is to modify the repeating process and adjust their phases by a Chu sequence so that the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM system is reduced for any SFC from the repeating and in the meantime, the full spatial and multipath diversities are maintained. In this paper, we also generalize the space-time- frequency coding by Zhang et al from using OSTBC to using linearly transformed quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes (QOSTBC) that possesses higher rate than the OSTBC for more than two transmit antennas, fast ML decoding and full spatial and multipath diversities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction for Space-Time-Frequency Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411439.pdf","startPage":"2796","endPage":"2800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction for Space-Time-Frequency Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411439/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823643","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction for Space-Time-Frequency Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H01P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052636S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411440,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Nguyen-Le","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hung","lastName":"Nguyen-Le","id":"38275020100"},{"name":"Tho Le-Ngoc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Tho","lastName":"Le-Ngoc","id":"37271236200"},{"name":"Chi Chung Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chi Chung","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279881600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411440","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Sampling methods","Resonance light scattering","Adaptive filters","Recursive estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Cost function","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","antenna arrays","channel estimation","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector RLS","MIMO-OFDM","channel impulse response","sampling frequency offset","burst-mode multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","recursive least-squares algorithm","adaptive filter","optimum receiver","Rayleigh multi-path fading channels"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a pilot-aided algorithm for the joint estimation of the channel impulse response (CIR), carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sampling frequency offset (SFO) in burst-mode multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We employ the vector recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm that can function as an adaptive filter with multiple outputs for the joint estimation problem in MIMO scenarios. Specifically, based on the received signal samples that contain pilot tones in the frequency domain, we formulate a cost function that includes the multi-antenna channel impulse responses and frequency offsets for the vector RLS-based joint estimation of CIR CFO and SFO. Analytical and simulated results show that, over large ranges of CFO and SFO values, the proposed estimation and tracking approach offers fast convergence, high stability, and provides a near optimum receiver performance that is remarkably close to the ideal one in the case of perfect channel estimation and synchronization over Rayleigh multi-path fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.530","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411440.pdf","startPage":"2801","endPage":"2805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector RLS-Based Joint Estimation of Channel Response and Frequency Offsets for MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411440/","displayDocTitle":"Vector RLS-Based Joint Estimation of Channel Response and Frequency Offsets for MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823644","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411440/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector RLS-Based Joint Estimation of Channel Response and Frequency Offsets for MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H01P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053635S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411441,"authors":[{"name":"Min Huang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Huang","id":"38236922900"},{"name":"Xiujun Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiujun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37675636200"},{"name":"Shidong Zhou","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shidong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276854100"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411441","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":604},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel state information","Transmitters","Downlink","Receiving antennas","Random variables","Filters","Interference suppression","Vectors","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","multiuser MIMO systems","imperfect channel state information","multiple- input multiple-output systems","diagonal weighted filter:","linear zero-forcing precoding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the investigation of Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) in downlink multiuser multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with imperfect channel state information (CSI) is carried out, including two basic structures according to the positions of the diagonal weighted filter: decentralized at the receivers or centralized at the transmitter, which are named as dTHP or cTHP, respectively.

Two equivalent signal models with embedded timing ambiguity are introduced first, and then two joint CFO and channel estimators are derived from the Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion. The first estimator obtained is a joint estimator for timing, CFO and channel, which needs a two dimension search for parameter estimation. The second estimator has a reduced complexity, but its performance slightly degrades compared with the first estimator due to more unknown parameters required to be estimated. We analyze and compare the MSE performance of the two estimators and find that when the number of subcarriers is large, the two estimators are equivalent.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411443.pdf","startPage":"2816","endPage":"2820","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Joint CFO and Channel Estimation in Quasi-Synchronized OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Timing","Maximum likelihood estimation","Degradation","Frequency synchronization","Frequency estimation","Robustness","Performance analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","quasisynchronized OFDM systems","CFO","carrier frequency offset","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","maximum likelihood criterion","timing","parameter estimation","MSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Joint CFO and Channel Estimation in Quasi-Synchronized OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411443/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823647","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Joint CFO and Channel Estimation in Quasi-Synchronized OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H02P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05221S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411444,"authors":[{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37284467100"},{"name":"Ananthram Swami","affiliation":["Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, USA"],"firstName":"Ananthram","lastName":"Swami","id":"37273357300"},{"name":"Philippe Ciblat","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9I\u00e9communications, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Ciblat","id":"37284917800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411444","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Frequency estimation","Frequency synchronization","Maximum likelihood estimation","Diversity methods","Computer simulation","Covariance matrix","Laboratories","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","frequency estimation","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CFO estimation","OFDM","correlated multipath fading channels","repetitive-slots","Cramer-Rao bound","multipath diversity gain","power loading scheme"]}],"abstract":"Carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation is a key challenge in multicarrier systems such as OFDM.

Analysis and simulations show the estimator is robust in both AWGN channel and frequency-selective channel.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.536","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411446.pdf","startPage":"2831","endPage":"2835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Blind Frequency Offset Estimation Based on Downsampling for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411446/","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Blind Frequency Offset Estimation Based on Downsampling for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823650","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411446/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Blind Frequency Offset Estimation Based on Downsampling for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H02P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073666S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411447,"authors":[{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281394100"},{"name":"Yiyan Wu","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yiyan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281231400"},{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292236100"},{"name":"Gilles Gagnon","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"37290454000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411447","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Random sequences","Interference cancellation","Robustness","Bandwidth","Intersymbol interference","Iterative algorithms","Equalizers","Performance analysis","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSE-OFDM System","reduced implementation complexity","pseudo random prefix","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","multisymbol encapsulated system","cyclic prefix","pseudo random sequence","intersymbol interference","OFDM symbols","iterative intercarrier interference cancellation algorithm","OFDM signal"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new Multi-Symbol Encapsulated Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MSE-OFDM) system with reduced implementation complexity in this paper, by replacing the traditional cyclic prefix (CP) with one pseudo random sequence. Although robust performance and high bandwidth efficiency are achieved, the receiver implementation of the previous MSE-OFDM system is substantially more complicated than traditional OFDM. In this paper, we propose a new cyclic prefix for MSE-OFDM using pseudo random sequences. With the new introduced cyclic prefix, inter-symbol interference (ISI) between OFDM symbols within one MSE-OFDM frame can be easily canceled in time domain. An iterative intercarrier interference (ICI) cancellation algorithm is also proposed in this paper. Equalization of the OFDM signal can therefore be achieved on every OFDM symbol basis, based on our new hybrid domain equalizer. It is shown that the implementation complexity of the new MSE- OFDM receiver with the pseudo random sequence cyclic prefix is comparable to the traditional OFDM. The performance of the proposed MSE-OFDM is also analyzed and verified through numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.537","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2836","endPage":"2840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An MSE-OFDM System with Reduced Implementation Complexity Using Pseudo Random Prefix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An MSE-OFDM System with Reduced Implementation Complexity Using Pseudo Random Prefix","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411447/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823651","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411447/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MSE-OFDM System with Reduced Implementation Complexity Using Pseudo Random Prefix","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H02P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052218S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411448,"authors":[{"name":"Oktay Ureten","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Oktay","lastName":"Ureten","id":"37267566900"},{"name":"Nur Serinken","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Nur","lastName":"Serinken","id":"37267565300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411448","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","OFDM","Detectors","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Data communication","Estimation error","Robustness","Radio frequency","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst mode OFDM","blind frame start estimation","coarse timing information","packet detector","power change","received signal","maximum a posteriori estimator","error estimation","burst detection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a blind frame start estimation scheme is proposed to improve the coarse timing information obtained from a packet detector in burst mode OFDM systems.

A high level of coordination involves a fine knowledge of the crosstalk coupling between lines and an imperfect channel estimation has an influence on the performance of the system. Classical estimation techniques that use training symbols have good performance with a low computational cost, but induce a loss in terms of bandwidth efficiency. In addition, the management of DSL lines should consider the insertion of a new user in a coordinated transmission. In this paper, we propose a crosstalk estimation method for including a new user without disrupting the transmission of the already coordinated users. The resulting channel estimation error is then analyzed as well as the impact on the expected data throughputs.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2868","endPage":"2872","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411453.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation Using Data and Pilots for a Coordinated DSL System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","DSL","Crosstalk","Couplings","Management training","Performance loss","Computational efficiency","Bandwidth","Error analysis","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","crosstalk","digital subscriber lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","coordinated DSL system","crosstalk estimation method","coordinated users","digital subscriber lines","crosstalk coupling","bandwidth efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation Using Data and Pilots for a Coordinated DSL System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411453/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411453/","accessionNumber":"9823656","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation Using Data and Pilots for a Coordinated DSL System","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H03P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048636S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4411455,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tao","id":"37399182100"},{"name":"Jingxian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, Sonoma State University, Rohnert Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jingxian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279160700"},{"name":"Chengshan Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Chengshan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37280816900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411455","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Rayleigh channels","Time varying systems","Signal analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Time domain analysis","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","fading channels","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler spread estimation","broadband wireless OFDM systems","broadband wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","intercarrier interference","signal-to-noise ratio","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel","discrete-time channel intertap correlation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new Doppler spread estimation algorithm for broadband wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with time-varying and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading. The algorithm is developed by analyzing the statistical properties of the power of received signals in the time domain, thus it excludes the influence of inter- carrier interference introduced by channel variation within one OFDM symbol. The operation of the algorithm doesn't require the knowledge of fading coefficients, transmitted data symbols, or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It works well under time-selective and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel with SNR as low as 0 dB. Moreover, unlike existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm takes into considerations of the discrete-time channel inter-tap correlation, as the case in practical systems. Simulation results demonstrate that this new algorithm can accurately estimate a wide range of Doppler spread with low estimation latency and high computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.545","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2878","endPage":"2882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler Spread Estimation for Broadband Wireless OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Doppler Spread Estimation for Broadband Wireless OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411455/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823658","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411455/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler Spread Estimation for Broadband Wireless OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H04P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072295S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411456,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Lin","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279366400"},{"name":"Tetsuo Adachi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37827930000"},{"name":"Katsumi Yamashita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsumi","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37268934800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411456","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Degradation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Interference","Computer simulation","Digital signal processing","Broadband communication","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset","imbalances compensation","OFDM systems","direct-conversion OFDM receiver","subcarrier allocation","matrix representation","maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"abstract":"Carrier frequency offset (CFO) and I/Q imbalances severely degrade the performance of direct-conversion OFDM receiver. In this paper, based on the subcarrier allocation (SCA) of OFDM signal, a novel approach for compensating CFO and I/Q imbalances is proposed. First, we derive a useful matrix representation of OFDM signal with CFO and I/Q imbalances. Then, maximum likelihood CFO estimation, as well as the associated SCA, are given. With the CFO estimate, a SCA-based algorithm which has a close-form solution, is proposed for the compensation of I/Q imbalances. Furthermore, due to the correspondence between the CFO estimate and the compensation of I/Q imbalances, the proposed approach can be extended to a blind compensation scheme, suitable for OFDM signals with asymmetric SCA. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset and I/Q Imbalances Compensation in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.546","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411456.pdf","startPage":"2883","endPage":"2888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset and I/Q Imbalances Compensation in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411456/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823659","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Frequency Offset and I/Q Imbalances Compensation in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H04P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059288S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411458,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Nomadic Embedded System Division, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37291655700"},{"name":"Bruno Bougard","affiliation":["Nomadic Embedded System Division, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Bougard","id":"37271999100"},{"name":"Eduardo Lopez-Estraviz","affiliation":["Nomadic Embedded System Division, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Lopez-Estraviz","id":"38272549400"},{"name":"Andre Bourdoux","affiliation":["Nomadic Embedded System Division, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Bourdoux","id":"37296640900"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["Nomadic Embedded System Division, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre","id":"37271995400"},{"name":"Francky Catthoor","affiliation":["Nomadic Embedded System Division, IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Francky","lastName":"Catthoor","id":"37275971400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411458","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","VLIW","Baseband","Signal processing","Scalability","Modulation coding","Energy efficiency","OFDM modulation","Transmitting antennas","Explosions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","parallel machines","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA modulation","low power transmitter","VLIW processor","spectral efficiency","advanced air interfaces","baseband processing","MIMO- OFDMA transmitters","relative constellation error","IEEE 802.16e specifications"]}],"abstract":"The improvement of spectral efficiency comes at the cost of exponential increment of signal processing complexity [1]. Hence, the energy-efficiency of baseband has recently turned out to be the bottleneck when deploying advanced air interfaces such as that in 4G. We advocate the scalable baseband design as a system level technique to aggressively optimize the average computation-load and associated energy-consumption. The key technique is to dynamically scale the baseband processing itself to the user requirement, the environment, the platform, etc. In this paper, we present the scalable design and VLIW processor based implementation of the OFDMA modulator, which is one of the most energy consuming parts of OFDMA and MIMO- OFDMA transmitters (in IEEE 802.16e , 3GPP LTE, etc.). Our work enables the OFDMA modulator to scale the modulation- accuracy and computation-load, so that the OFDMA modulator can dynamically reconfigure and work with minimal number of operations, whereas the required modulation-accuracy is still firmly guaranteed. Our work brings significant reductions in the average computation-load and associated energy-dissipation on real-life programmable platforms. Specifically, when the user is working with 16QAM and 1/2 coding rate (Turbo Coding) in a half-loaded 8-user system, the proposed scheme reduces 84% of the cycle-count and the associated energy-consumption on TI TMS320C6713, whereas the resulted Relative Constellation Error (RCE) is still lOdB better than the required RCE in IEEE 802.16e specifications.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.548","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2894","endPage":"2898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Quality-Energy Scalable OFDMA Modulation for Low Power Transmitter and VLIW Processor Based Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Quality-Energy Scalable OFDMA Modulation for Low Power Transmitter and VLIW Processor Based Implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411458/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823661","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411458/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Quality-Energy Scalable OFDMA Modulation for Low Power Transmitter and VLIW Processor Based Implementation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H04P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044165S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411460,"authors":[{"name":"Ali A.

On each OFDM subcarrier, the scheme uses a specialized representation of QAM symbols that allows mapping of a group of symbols from the conventional constellation onto an alternative symbol from the external square of signalling points. The design of the expanded constellation maintains the minimum distance between signalling points with a minimal increase in the average power. Its advantage stems from the location of the alternative signalling point being \"radially symmetric\" to the group of original signalling points in QAM. In systems using coding, the alternative signalling points represent recoverable erasures introduced at the transmitter for the purpose of reducing PAPR. The proposed PAPR reduction method is especially applicable to QAM schemes with high number of constellation points such as M = 64 and M = 256. Significant PAPR reduction is achieved by careful mapping and selection of alternative signalling points for transmission that result in lower PAPRs. Specifically, the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the modified OFDM signal shows (5) dB improvement in PAPR at a clipping probability of 10 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n over the original OFDM signal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erasure Based PAPR Reduction Using Minimally Expanded Constellations in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.550","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411460.pdf","startPage":"2904","endPage":"2909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Erasure Based PAPR Reduction Using Minimally Expanded Constellations in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411460/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823663","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erasure Based PAPR Reduction Using Minimally Expanded Constellations in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H04P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038697S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411461,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Duvaut","affiliation":["Conexant Syst.

The achievable rate region is obtained by solving a series of weighted sum-rate maximization problems, and the associated users' power distributions are efficiently found by a Lagrange dual- decomposition method along with a per-tone-based exhaustive search of decoding orders among users. The complexity can be further reduced by replacing the exhaustive search with a greedy algorithm. Simulation results show that the achievable rate region obtained by the greedy algorithm is very close to that achieved by the exhaustive search.

In this paper, a bandwidth efficient cooperative diversity scheme is proposed for half-duplex amplify- and-forward wireless relay networks. By employing a signal space diversity technique and allowing the source node to keep on transmitting over the whole duration of the cooperation frame, the proposed cooperative scheme is proved to be able to achieve both full-rate and full-diversity simultaneously. Diversity analysis shows that the achievable diversity gain is M + 1, where M is the number of relay nodes. Moreover, a power allocation scheme is proposed to maximize the coding gain under a total power constraint.

Due to the effects of channel fading, individual CRs may not be able to reliably detect the existence of a primary radio, who is a licensed user for the particular band. In this paper, we present optimal cooperation strategies for spectrum sensing to combat the effects of destructive channels and malfunctioning devices. Our approach conducts spectrum sensing based on the linear combination of local test statistics from individual secondary users. We propose two optimization schemes to control the combining weights, and compare their performance. Our first approach is to optimize the probability distribution function of the global test statistics at the fusion center. For the second scheme, we maximize the global detection sensitivity under constraints on the false alarm probability.

However, the process of making available the same message to all collaborating nodes introduces delays. In this paper, a MAC-PHY cross-layer scheme is proposed that enables collaborative beamforming at significantly reduced collaboration overhead. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access time-slotted fashion. Simultaneous transmissions from multiple source nodes are viewed as linear mixtures of all transmitted packets. In the second phase, a set of collaborating nodes, acting as a distributed antenna system, beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex weight, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which allows packets bound to the same destination to add coherently at the destination node. Assuming that each node has access to location information, the proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain cases exceeds one. An analysis of the symbol error probability corresponding to the proposed scheme is provided.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2957","endPage":"2961","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411470.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Beamforming for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411470/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Beamforming for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823673","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Beamforming for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H06P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038719S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411472,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza S.

We shall investigate maximum SNR solutions subject to power constraints and zero-forcing (ZF) criteria, as well as approximate MMSE equalizers with specified target SNR and global power constraint.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.562","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411472.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2967","endPage":"2971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Signal Processing Methods for MIMO Relay Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Signal Processing Methods for MIMO Relay Architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411472/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823675","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411472/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Signal Processing Methods for MIMO Relay Architectures","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H06P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043147S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411473,"authors":[{"name":"Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Jayakrishnan","lastName":"Unnikrishnan","id":"37572645200"},{"name":"Venugopal V.

Previous works on the problem of detection for cognitive radio have suggested the necessity of user cooperation in order to be able to detect at the really low signal- to-noise ratios experienced in practical situations. We consider a system of cognitive radio users who cooperate with each other in trying to detect licensed transmissions. Assuming that the cooperating nodes use identical energy detectors, we model the received signals as correlated log-normal random variables and study the problem of fusing the decisions made by the individual nodes. We design a linear-quadratic (LQ) fusion strategy based on a deflection criterion for this problem, that takes into account the correlation between the nodes. Our simulation results show that the LQ detector significantly outperforms the counting rule, which is the fusion rule that is obtained by ignoring the correlation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411473.pdf","startPage":"2972","endPage":"2976","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing and Detection for Cognitive Radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Detectors","Radio transmitters","Protection","Signal detection","Reliability engineering","Random variables","Interference constraints","Decoding","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision theory","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","cooperative spectrum detection","cognitive radio","licensed primary transmission detection","correlated log-normal random variable","linear-quadratic fusion","LQ detector","decision fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing and Detection for Cognitive Radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411473/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823676","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing and Detection for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H07P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052363S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411474,"authors":[{"name":"Karama Hamdi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Karama","lastName":"Hamdi","id":"37637368000"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"},{"name":"Khaled Ben Letaief","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Khaled Ben","lastName":"Letaief","id":"37273525100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411474","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":783},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Interference","Base stations","Downlink","Transmitting antennas","FCC","System performance","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","cognitive radio","interference (signal)","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint beamforming","scheduling","cognitive radio networks","spectrum utilization","cognitive base station","transmit beamforming technique","signal-to-interference- and-noise ratio","limit interference","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio has been recently proposed as a promising technology to improve the spectrum utilization. In this paper, we consider the coexistence between a large number of cognitive radio users and a licensed user in order to enhance the spectrum efficiency. With the deployment of M antennas at the cognitive base station, an efficient transmit beamforming technique combined with user selection is proposed to maximize the downlink throughput and satisfy the signal-to-interference- and-noise ratio (SINR) constraint as well as limit interference to the primary user. In the proposed user selection algorithm, cognitive users who are nearly orthogonal to the primary user are first pre-selected so as to minimize the mutual interference. Then, M best cognitive users who are nearly mutual orthogonal to each other are scheduled from those pre-selected cognitive users. Simulation results show that our proposed method is able to achieve high sum-rate throughput, with affordable complexity. Moreover, our proposed technique with equal power allocation suffers a negligible performance loss compared to the one with the optimal power allocation.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.564","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"2977","endPage":"2981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411474/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823677","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411474/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Beamforming and Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H07P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044305S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411475,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Nokleby","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Nokleby","id":"37545942600"},{"name":"A.

Their properties (in terms of expectation and mean-squared estimation error) as well as complexity are discussed. Their average performance is also analytically approached. For the sake of low complexity, the derived estimators are either linear or affine in the vector of observations at the channel output. Such estimators are referred to as iterative because they use soft information on data symbols fed back by the soft-in/soft-out (SISO) channel decoder of a turbo equalizer. Because involved in this iterative process, they perform better at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) than standard (i.e. non iterative) channel estimators using the same number of pilot symbols. Conversely, iterative estimators require a smaller number of pilot symbols to achieve the same performance as standard estimators.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.569","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"3002","endPage":"3007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411479.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Iterative decoding","Sections","Performance analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation error","Vectors","Equalizers","Transmitters","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative decoding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity iterative estimators","quasi static frequency selective channels","soft-in/soft-out channel decoder","turbo equalizer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Iterative Estimators of Quasi Static Frequency Selective Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411479/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411479/","accessionNumber":"9823682","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Iterative Estimators of Quasi Static Frequency Selective Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H08P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100031S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411480,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianwu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37656892900"},{"name":"Yik-Chung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yik-Chung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281222900"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Tung-Sang Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tung-Sang","lastName":"Ng","id":"37280168200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411480","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Base stations","Oscillators","Frequency synchronization","Design engineering","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint CFO","channel estimation","multiuser MIMO OFDM system","joint carrier frequency offset","mean square error","Cramer-Rao bound","sequence selection","channel parameters","asymptotic CRB","optimal training sequences"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of optimal training for joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation in multiuser MIMO OFDM systems, where each user can utilize all available subcarriers. To choose the training sequence with the goal of providing the smallest estimation mean square error (MSE), the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is derived in close-form. However, little insight on the sequence selection can be obtained from the CRB directly due to its complicated dependence on training sequence and channel parameters.

We verify our results using experimentally measured electromagnetic data in an indoor environment.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411484.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.574","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"3029","endPage":"3033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Antenna Time Reversal Transmission in Ultra-Wideband Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Antenna Time Reversal Transmission in Ultra-Wideband Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411484/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411484/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823687","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Antenna Time Reversal Transmission in Ultra-Wideband Communications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"H09P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067442S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411485,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Shi","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communication and Signal Processing Research ECE Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Shi","id":"38270545000"},{"name":"Yeheskel Bar-Ness","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communication and Signal Processing Research ECE Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yeheskel","lastName":"Bar-Ness","id":"38272137900"},{"name":"Wei Su","affiliation":["U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Su","id":"37276623500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411485","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Testing","Diversity reception","AWGN","Signal processing","Space technology","Correlators","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","MIMO communication","modulation","Monte Carlo methods","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STC","BLAST MIMO modulation recognition","space time coding","antenna","linear combining process","Monte Carlo simulations"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate one of the MIMO classification problem: distinguishing Space Time Coding (STC) from BLAST schemes.

We also derive the transmit directions that maximize the mutual information lower and upper bounds when delayed feedback is available from the receiver to the transmitters, and characterize the power allocation of this system in terms of its beamforming range.

When the synchronizer uses a periodic phase detector, it is currently the subject of ambiguous locking. Generally, for fast acquisition systems, the phase ambiguity is removed by the use of differential encoding. However, this results in degraded bit error probability performance. In this paper we introduce and describe an optimized phase detector suited to 16-QAM receivers which prevents ambiguous locking and performs relatively rapid acquisition. Based on a new decision scheme, the proposed phase detector outperforms a classical decision directed phase detector over a Gaussian channel, notably in the presence of frequency offset and even for low signal-to-noise ratios.

However, spectrum sensing can cause negative effects to the performance of the CR network, as all CR communication has to be postponed during channel sensing. This paper focuses on adaptively scheduling the spectrum sensing periods so that negative impacts to the performance of the CR network are minimized. We first consider the case when CR nodes always have data to transmit and experience time- varying channels. Based on knowledge of channel conditions, the sensing periods are adaptively scheduled to maximize the spectrum efficiency of the CR operation. We then consider the case when CR nodes experience both stochastic data arrival and time-varying channels.

Soft combination of the observed energy values from different cognitive radio users is investigated. Maximal ratio combination (MRC) is theoretically proved to be nearly optimal in low signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) region, an usual scenario in the context of cognitive radio. Both MRC and equal gain combination (EGC) exhibit significant performance improvement over conventional hard combination. Encouraged by the performance gain of soft combination, we propose a new softened hard combination scheme with two-bit overhead for each user and achieve a good tradeoff between detection performance and complexity. While traditionally energy detection suffers from an SNR wall caused by noise power uncertainty, it is shown in this paper that an SNR wall reduction can be achieved by employing cooperation among independent cognitive radio users.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.594","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411504.pdf","startPage":"3139","endPage":"3143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Combination and Detection for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411504/","displayDocTitle":"Soft Combination and Detection for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823707","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411504/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Combination and Detection for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I01P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066295S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411505,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Chen","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290090300"},{"name":"Alexander Wyglinski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Wyglinski","id":"37281322800"},{"name":"Gary Minden","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Minden","id":"37297038000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411505","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Interference","Delay effects","Computer networks","Telecommunication computing","Acoustical engineering","Design engineering","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless communication","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","modulation","spread spectrum communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency agile interference-aware channel sounding","dynamic spectrum access networks","multicarrier direct sequence swept time delay cross-correlation","channel sounder","multicarrier spread spectrum modulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel channel sounding technique, called the multicarrier direct sequence swept time delay cross-correlation (MC-DS-STDCC), which is designed to minimize the interference with incumbent licensed transmissions within the context of a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) network.

However, the maximum-tolerable transmit power levels permitted across the spectrum within a DSA network can potentially be non-uniform. Our proposed channel sounder is designed to tailor the transmit power level across the frequency band of operation, limiting it to the constraints imposed by both licensed and unlicensed devices, as well as by regulatory agencies.

The performance of the singular value decomposition (SVD) scheme is limited by the smallest singular value. When all the subchannels are utilized, uniform channel decomposition (UCD) was recently proposed to obtain a performance gain by making subchannels have equal gains. The UCD requires a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver, and thus it suffers from the error propagation inherent in the SIC receiver. We propose the blockwise UCD (BL-UCD) scheme which increases the minimum subchannel gain by pairing two singular values. The proposed scheme allows single-symbol decodable maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) instead of the SIC receiver. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BL-UCD scheme outperforms the SVD scheme and the conventional UCD at full spatial multiplexing for four transmit antennas and four receive antennas by 8 dB and 5 dB, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockwise Uniform Channel Decomposition for MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.597","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411507.pdf","startPage":"3154","endPage":"3158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Blockwise Uniform Channel Decomposition for MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411507/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823710","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blockwise Uniform Channel Decomposition for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I02P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052796S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411508,"authors":[{"name":"Heunchul Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heunchul","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292580700"},{"name":"Bertrand M.

Recently, the block-diagonalization (BD) algorithm has been proposed for the multiuser MIMO downlink where each user has multiple antennas. The key idea of the BD scheme is to eliminate all multiuser interference by transmitting each user's data along the nullspace of the other users' channel matrix. However, the BD algorithm based on the zero- interference condition is not a proper choice when the interference is known at the transmitter noncausally. In this paper, we propose a block-echelonization (BE) algorithm for utilizing the noncausally known interference at the transmitter.

The wireless channels are decomposed into several eigenmodes, and the eigenmode based power allocation is formulated into an optimization problem, whose object is to maximize the system capacity while guaranteeing users' QoS requirements. By replacing the QoS constraints with penalty functions, the problem is reformulated to a penalty problem with a given penalty factor, which is solved by a greedy power allocation (GPA) scheme as the inner loop. The penalty factor is then updated in the outer loop according to QoS constraints. Numerical results show that compared with other algorithms proposed in the literature, ESDL can result in significant improvement in channel efficiency, while at the same time guaranteeing minimum data rates of users.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.599","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411509.pdf","startPage":"3164","endPage":"3168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS Aware Eigenmode Based Power Allocation Scheme for MIMO-OFDM Multi-User Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411509/","displayDocTitle":"A QoS Aware Eigenmode Based Power Allocation Scheme for MIMO-OFDM Multi-User Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823711","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411509/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS Aware Eigenmode Based Power Allocation Scheme for MIMO-OFDM Multi-User Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I02P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071459S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411510,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, its performance is degraded for relatively small K, e.g., Kles100, partly due to the excessive transmit power penalty when the channel matrix of selected user subset is poorly conditioned. To avoid this power penalty, we propose to use channel inversion regularization (CIR) in the precoder in MIMO BC channels. Unlike the interference-free ZF, maximizing sum-rate capacity using CIR precoder becomes a nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problem, which cannot be solved by simple water-filling strategy. Hence, we propose an efficient optimal power allocation strategy for the selected users based on gradient projection (GP) method. Simulation results show that the proposed precoding and power allocation scheme achieves better sum-rate performance than ZF for a wide range of K.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.604","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411514.pdf","startPage":"3190","endPage":"3194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Capacity-Achieving Precoding Scheme Based on Channel Inversion Regularization with Optimal Power Allocation for MIMO Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411514/","displayDocTitle":"A Capacity-Achieving Precoding Scheme Based on Channel Inversion Regularization with Optimal Power Allocation for MIMO Broadcast Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823716","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411514/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Capacity-Achieving Precoding Scheme Based on Channel Inversion Regularization with Optimal Power Allocation for MIMO Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I03P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062539S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411515,"authors":[{"name":"Michel T.

Effective modeling of the cellular downlink as a Gaussian broadcast channel requires that the ICI powers at the user positions are known to the basestation (BS), as it otherwise, cannot attempt to approach (or even know) its capacity region. However, ICI depends on the transmit processing of the BSs in the neighboring cells, which furthermore is subject to change quickly due to temporal scheduling. The BS therefore only has limited knowledge about the true ICI powers. In this paper, the implications of this lack of knowledge about ICI power on the achievable sum- rate of a Gaussian MISO (multi-input, single-output) broadcast channel is examined. Four different approaches on dealing with unpredictable ICI are discussed and their performance compared to the single-cell (or non-cellular) Gaussian broadcast channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411515.pdf","startPage":"3195","endPage":"3199","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intercell-Interference in the Gaussian MISO Broadcast Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Signal processing","Downlink","Frequency","Interference","Communication systems","Bandwidth","Circuit theory","Power system modeling","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","Gaussian channels","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercell-interference","Gaussian MISO broadcast channel","cellular downlink","basestation","temporal scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Intercell-Interference in the Gaussian MISO Broadcast Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411515/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823717","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intercell-Interference in the Gaussian MISO Broadcast Channel","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I03P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06066S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411516,"authors":[{"name":"Zohreh Motamedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Zohreh","lastName":"Motamedi","id":"37297004100"},{"name":"M.

However, there is an implicit loss in data throughput even due to partial CSI feedback which is not included in conventional sum-rate computations. We introduce a sum-rate distortion model including the implicit loss for a multiuser MIMO downlink with block diagonalization. A distortion function is subsequently presented which accounts for quantization error at the receiver, feedback latency due to non-homogenous receiver channel coherence times and the loss in net capacity due to feedback overhead. This system model is used to derive bounds on the amount of feedback that can be supported under various antenna, channel and signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. Simulation results are presented to show the impact of feedback on the sum- rate for multi-antenna wireless systems with multiple users.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411517.pdf","startPage":"3205","endPage":"3209","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-Rate Distortion in MIMO Broadcast Channels with Irregular Limited Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Feedback","Channel state information","Transmitters","Throughput","Downlink","Quantization","Delay","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","distortion","feedback","MIMO communication","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum-rate distortion","MIMO broadcast channels","irregular limited feedback","channel state information","partial CSI feedback","block diagonalization","quantization error","signal-to-noise ratio","multiantenna wireless systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate Distortion in MIMO Broadcast Channels with Irregular Limited Feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411517/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823719","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-Rate Distortion in MIMO Broadcast Channels with Irregular Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I03P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102725S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411518,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Josiam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Josiam","id":"37418703200"},{"name":"Dinesh Rajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Rajan","id":"37270183200"},{"name":"Mandyam Srinath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mandyam","lastName":"Srinath","id":"37296291200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411518","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Transmitters","Power control","Fading","Broadcasting","MIMO","Diversity methods","Performance gain","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","feedback","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiplexing","multiuser channels","power control","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity multiplexing tradeoff","multiple antenna multiple access channels","partial CSIT","temporal power control","finite rate feedback","SISO MAC","opportunistic user selection","multiplexing gains","MIMO MAC","probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411518","abstract":"We derive a lower bound on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for multiple antenna multiple access channels using temporal power control (PC).

The new inverse transform matrix is used in lieu of regular FFT. In uplink of OFDMA, different users (subcarriers) may have different frequency offsets, which causes severe performance degradation. It is also difficult to estimate/compensate these frequency offsets in uplink case. Even if the frequency offsets are correctly estimated, the compensation of one subcarrier (or user) may worsen the inter-carrier interference from the frequency offsets of other subcarriers (users). A single MMSE-based transform is used to perform both inverse Fourier transform and frequency offset compensation. Compared to the conventional methods such as circular convolution, this approach has lower computational complexity with comparable performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411519.pdf","startPage":"3215","endPage":"3219","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User MMSE-Based Frequency Synchronization in OFDMA Uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Frequency estimation","OFDM","Convolution","Frequency domain analysis","Interference cancellation","Fourier transforms","Computational complexity","Discrete Fourier transforms","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","frequency division multiple access","frequency division multiplexing","intercarrier interference","least mean squares methods","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MMSE","frequency synchronization","OFDMA uplink","FFT matrix","inverse transform matrix","performance degradation","intercarrier interference","inverse Fourier transform","frequency offset compensation","circular convolution","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User MMSE-Based Frequency Synchronization in OFDMA Uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823721","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User MMSE-Based Frequency Synchronization in OFDMA Uplink","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I04P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028081S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411520,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv Agarwal","firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37298641800"},{"name":"Vineet Abhishek","firstName":"Vineet","lastName":"Abhishek","id":"37695022500"},{"name":"Rath Vannithamby","firstName":"Rath","lastName":"Vannithamby","id":"37399553900"},{"name":"John Cioffi","firstName":"John","lastName":"Cioffi","id":"37276932400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411520","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Access protocols","Resource management","Telecommunication traffic","Streaming media","Transmitters","Base stations","State feedback","Next generation networking","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","frequency division multiple access","quality of service","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic feedback","OFDMA downlink","channel-state-information feedback","channel state measurement","base station","resource allocation problem","heterogeneous traffic","deadline-sensitive applications","best- effort users"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an opportunistic feedback (OF) protocol that reduces the amount of channel-state-information (CSI) feedback for the OFDMA downlink system.

Simulation results show that the multi-hop OFDMA relaying systems outperform the conventional OFDMA systems by more than 30% with use of the proposed resource-allocation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.611","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411521.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3225","endPage":"3229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource-Allocation for OFDMA Multi-Hop Relaying Downlink Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource-Allocation for OFDMA Multi-Hop Relaying Downlink Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411521/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823723","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411521/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource-Allocation for OFDMA Multi-Hop Relaying Downlink Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I04P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047662S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411522,"authors":[{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"},{"name":"Michael Reyer","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Reyer","id":"37542283800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411522","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"The present correspondence deals with the rate and power allocation problem for multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA).

In this paper, we study the outage probability of low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded systems for slow fading channels (nonergodic channels) under the assumption that the transmitter knows only the channel statistics while the receiver has perfect or imperfect channel side information (CSI). The fading coefficient is assumed to be random but stays constant over a LDPC codeword. We define the outage event as the set of channel realizations which disables successful decoding.

Both the single-frequency-offset case and the multiple-frequency-offset case are treated. Constant-envelope (CE) is shown to be a sufficient but not necessary condition for optimizing the mean square error (MSE). When the CE condition is relaxed, i.e., pilots with multiple envelope values, the power allocation and placement rules for the optimal MSE performance are derived. The least-squares (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimators are designed for uncorrelated and correlated MIMO-OFDM channels, respectively. Both optimal adaptive pilot power allocation and suboptimal uniform pilot power allocation strategies are developed for the proposed LMMSE estimator. The adaptive allocation performs 4 dB better than the uniform allocation in the high noise region, but they both perform identically in the low noise region. Performance comparisons are made against several previous pilot designs due to [1]. The proposed LMMSE estimator significantly outperforms the LS estimator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation in Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.622","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411532.pdf","startPage":"3280","endPage":"3284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation in Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411532/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823734","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation in Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I06P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047737S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411533,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Tolli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Tolli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"Marian Codreanu","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Codreanu","id":"37268997300"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411533","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Quality of service","Transceivers","Downlink","Design optimization","Filtering theory","Base stations","Power amplifiers","Wireless communication","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","concave programming","MIMO communication","quality of service","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear multiuser MIMO transmission","quality of service","antenna power constraints","linear multiuser multiple-input multiple-output transceiver","joint transceiver optimization algorithms","optimal nonlinear transmission methods","zero forcing transmission solutions","nonconvex transceiver optimization problems"]}],"abstract":"Joint design of linear multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver subject to different quality of service constraints per user and with per antenna or antenna group power constraints is considered.

Among the MU-MIMO techniques, the block diagonalization (BD) algorithm is well known as a practical linear precoding technique for a downlink. In this paper, we analyze an achievable bit rate in MU-MIMO using BD algorithm and derive the simplified expression using the signal spaces of users. Based on the derived expression, two kinds of user selection methods for the BD algorithm (USBD) in MU-MIMO systems are proposed. The proposed methods estimate the improvement in the achievable bit rate compared to that in a single user (SU)-MIMO system using the signal spaces of the supported users. The first proposed method is USBD with a full search (USBD-FS) and it selects the combination of users to achieve the highest total throughput by considering all the combinations. The second proposed method is USBD with a tree structure search (USBD-TS), which drastically reduces the calculation complexity. Although all combinations of users are not considered in USBD-TS, a sufficient achievable bit rate is obtained while the calculation load is much less than that for the conventional method. Computer simulations confirm that USBD- FS and USBD-TS obtain the achievable bit rate of 100.0% and 91.1% compared to that for the best combination of users when the angle spread at the transmitter is 75deg.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Selection Method for Block Diagonalization in Multiuser MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.625","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411535.pdf","startPage":"3295","endPage":"3300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"User Selection Method for Block Diagonalization in Multiuser MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411535/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823737","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Selection Method for Block Diagonalization in Multiuser MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I06P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07671S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411536,"authors":[{"name":"Zhendong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhendong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38200057400"},{"name":"Branka Vucetic","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Branka","lastName":"Vucetic","id":"37278594000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411536","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Turbo codes","MIMO","Bit error rate","Performance gain","Adaptive systems","Channel state information","Transmitters","Modulation coding","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","error statistics","MIMO communication","multiplexing","telecommunication channels","transmitters","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive turbo coded MIMO system","full multiplexing gain","multiple-input multiple- output","channel state information","transmitter","multiplexing gain","bit error rate","BER","rate-compatible punctured turbo codes"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive turbo coded multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) system with outdated channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is proposed and investigated with a focus on the multiplexing gain and the bit error rate (BER) performance.

We investigate the utility of two channel capacity definitions, ergodic capacity, where it is assumed that the channel cycles through all fading states, and outage capacity, where the source is transmitted at a constant rate with a specified outage probability. We also study the outage rate and expected source distortion for different outage probabilities. It is observed that the outage probabilities required to maximize outage rate and minimize expected distortion are quite different. This implies that schemes based on maximizing capacity might not lead to the most efficient design for lossy transmission of source information over wireless networks. We show that minimizing expected distortion over a wireless link does not necessarily minimize the variance of the distortion, and hence parameter selection based on minimizing expected distortion can lead to a high distortion for a specific realization. We also introduce different performance measures that take into account the variance of source distortion and might be more suitable for source transmission over fading channels. Finally, we observe that in a Rayleigh fading channel in the presence of channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and receiver, in addition to a capacity distribution, there is a source distortion distribution at the receiver for a memoryless Gaussian source. A careful investigation of the capacity and source distortion distributions reveal that the probability of achieving the average source distortion increases with an increase in average signal to noise ratio (SNR) while the probability of achieving the average capacity does not change significantly with SNR.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.629","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3316","endPage":"3321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Transmission Over Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Information Transmission Over Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411539/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823741","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411539/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Transmission Over Fading Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I07P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054466S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411541,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Musavian","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Musavian","id":"37284625400"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411541","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Interference constraints","Radio spectrum management","Channel capacity","AWGN","Licenses","Communications technology","Joining processes","Receivers","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","interference (signal)","radio networks","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic capacities","outage capacities","spectrum-sharing systems","wireless applications","radio spectrum","spectrum utilization","primary receiver","channel capacity","Rayleigh flat-fading channel","power allocation policies"]}],"abstract":"In this fast growing technology world, where communications play a major rule for connecting people and machines together, the growth in wireless applications have caused an increasing demand for gaining access to the radio spectrum. However, the outdated spectrum utilization policies, imposed by the regulatory bodies in the past century, have caused the spectrum to look over-saturated. Recently, the concept of opportunistic spectrum access has been introduced as a tool to overcome the scarcity of the spectrum. The latter technology offers a tremendous potential to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum by implementing an efficient sharing of the licensed spectrum, whereby a secondary user may utilize the primary user's licensed band as long as its interference to the primary receiver remains below a tolerable level. In this paper, we investigate the capacity gains offered by this spectrum-sharing approach in Rayleigh fading environments. In particular, we derive the fading channel capacity of a secondary user subject to both average and peak received-power constraints at the primary's receiver. Considering both constraints, we derive the ergodic and outage capacities along with their optimum power allocation policies for Rayleigh flat-fading channel, and provide closed-form expressions for these capacity metrics. Furthermore, numerical simulations are conducted to corroborate our theoretical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic and Outage Capacities of Spectrum-Sharing Systems in Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411541.pdf","startPage":"3327","endPage":"3331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic and Outage Capacities of Spectrum-Sharing Systems in Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411541/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823743","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic and Outage Capacities of Spectrum-Sharing Systems in Fading Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I07P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061044S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411546,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Qi","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Qi","id":"37394874700"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411546","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Automatic repeat request","Protocols","Fading","Modulation coding","Protection","Performance loss","Propagation losses","Physical layer","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","automatic repeat request","diversity reception","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced AMC","truncated ARQ protocols","cross-layer approach","adaptive modulation and coding","automatic repeat request","constellation rearrangement","spectral efficiency","data packet","diversity gain","Nakagami-m fading channels"]}],"abstract":"Using a cross-layer approach, two enhancement techniques applied for adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) with truncated automatic repeat request (T-ARQ) are investigated, namely, aggressive AMC (A-AMC) and constellation rearrangement (CoRe). Aggressive AMC selects the appropriate modulation and coding schemes (MCS) to achieve higher spectral efficiency, profiting from the feasibility of using different MCSs for retransmitting a packet, whereas in the CoRe-based AMC, retransmissions of the same data packet are performed using different mappings so as to provide different degrees of protection to the bits involved, thus achieving mapping diversity gain. The performance of both schemes is evaluated in terms of average spectral efficiency and average packet loss rate, which are derived in closed-form considering transmission over Nakagami-m fading channels.

In particular, it is shown that A-AMC combined with T-ARQ yields higher spectral efficiency than the AMC-based conventional scheme while keeping the achieved packet loss rate closer to the system's requirement, and that it can achieve larger spectral efficiency objectives than that of the scheme using AMC along with CoRe.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Design of Enhanced AMC with Truncated ARQ Protocols","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.636","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411546.pdf","startPage":"3353","endPage":"3357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Design of Enhanced AMC with Truncated ARQ Protocols","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411546/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823748","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Design of Enhanced AMC with Truncated ARQ Protocols","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I08P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09538S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411548,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Fu","id":"37286401800"},{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong In","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279315300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411548","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"abstract":"This paper is concerned with the throughput and fairness analysis in a downlink WCDMA network with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and fast cell selection (FCS).

Simulation results over multipath Rayleigh block fading channels for various MIMO configurations show the benefits provided by each scheme.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.649","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411559.pdf","startPage":"3421","endPage":"3426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Turbo Equalization for OFDM and Single-Carrier Transmission in ST-BICM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411559/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Turbo Equalization for OFDM and Single-Carrier Transmission in ST-BICM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823760","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411559/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Turbo Equalization for OFDM and Single-Carrier Transmission in ST-BICM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I10P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06772S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4411560,"authors":[{"name":"Leandro D'Orazio","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"D'Orazio","id":"37694401500"},{"name":"Claudio Sacchi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Sacchi","id":"37282261300"},{"name":"Riccardo Fedrizzi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Fedrizzi","id":"37402693800"},{"name":"Francesco G.

The key feature of MIMO MC-CDMA is the capability of exploiting diversity jointly in time, frequency and in the space domains. Very promising results have been achieved by STBC-MIMO MC-CDMA using receiver schemes targeted to maximize the signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SINR) at the output of the diversity combiner. Such a concept turns on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) combining criterion. Nevertheless, it is known by literature that MSE cost function is not always optimal in digital communications. In this work, we are proposing an adaptive multi-user detection approach based on a minimum-BER (M- BER) concept for a synchronous STBC-MIMO MC-CDMA system transmitting data over time-varying multipath fading channels. The practical implementation of the M-BER receiver relies on an adaptive least-mean-square (LMS)-like algorithm, periodically aided by a training sequence and working in decision-directed modality during a coherence time window. Experimental results have shown a performance improvement yielded by the proposed adaptive M-BER MUD with respect to MMSE adaptive MUD achieved by spending an affordable computational effort.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.650","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411560.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3427","endPage":"3431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Minimum-BER Approach for Multi-User Detection in STBC-MIMO MC-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Minimum-BER Approach for Multi-User Detection in STBC-MIMO MC-CDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411560/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823761","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411560/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Minimum-BER Approach for Multi-User Detection in STBC-MIMO MC-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I10P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061805S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411562,"authors":[{"name":"Alfonso Cano","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, University of Minnesota, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Cano","id":"37287904600"},{"name":"Eduardo Morgado","affiliation":["Dept. of TSC, ETSIT-URJC, Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Morgado","id":"37535672500"},{"name":"Antonio Caamano","affiliation":["Dept. of TSC, ETSIT-URJC, Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Caamano","id":"37272974600"},{"name":"Javier Ramos","affiliation":["Dept. of TSC, ETSIT-URJC, Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Ramos","id":"38556075100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411562","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411562","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Protocols","OFDM","Time division multiplexing","Broadcasting","Recruitment","Frequency","Demodulation","Signal design","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","modulation","receivers","telecommunication channels","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed double-differential modulation","cooperative communications","CFO","neighboring terminals","channel state","by-passes channel","double-differential codecs","orthogonal channels","time-division multiplexing","multiantenna DD systems;","selective-relaying cooperation protocols","spatial diversity"]}],"abstract":"When a terminal is recruited to cooperate with other neighboring terminals, its channel state and carrier frequency offset (CFO) may be unknown to the destination.

Two double-differential codecs are proposed transmitting: i) across orthogonal channels using time-division multiplexing, achieving rate and error performance similar to that of co-located multi-antenna DD systems; or ii) simultaneously, benefiting from the distinct CFOs across terminals and bypassing the need of ordering protocols. Both (i)-(ii) approaches are considered in adaptive- and selective-relaying cooperation protocols demonstrating that maximum spatial diversity is achievable.

The selection method generally requires some feedback from the destination to the relays and the source, raising the issue of the interplay between performance and feedback rate. In this paper, we treat selection as an instance of limited- feedback distributed beamforming in cooperative AF networks, and highlight the differences between transmit beamforming in a traditional multi-input single-output (MISO) system and the distributed case. Specifically, Grassmanian line packing (GLP) is no longer the optimal codebook design, and orthogonal codebooks are no longer equivalent to each other. We derive the high signal-to-noise ratio expressions for outage probability and probability of symbol error for unlimited-feedback and selection schemes. The gap in performance between unlimited-feedback and selection beamforming is found analytically to grow rapidly with the number of relays. We compare the selection protocol to a limited-feedback distributed beamformer that assigns codebooks based on the generalized lloyd algorithm (GLA), and one that uses random beam-vectors. The main conclusion is that the performance improvement to be seen using the very complex GLA is small, and that many more feedback bits are required with random beamforming than selection for the same performance. These results indicate that the selection protocol is a very attractive protocol with low-complexity that provides excellent performance relative to other known methods.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.656","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411566.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3457","endPage":"3461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming with Limited Feedback in Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming with Limited Feedback in Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411566/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823767","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411566/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming with Limited Feedback in Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I11P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063001S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411572,"authors":[{"name":"Jinri Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinri","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293534800"},{"name":"Zhisheng Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Niu","id":"37269009300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411572","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the proportional fair scheduling (PFS) problem for multiuser OFDM systems, considering the impact of packet length.

The scheme firstly allocates subcarriers among users without considering the packet length constraint. Then subcarrier readjustment is done in a way that surplus subcarriers from length-satisfied users are released and allocated among length-unsatisfied users. The objective is to provide proportional fairness among users while guaranteeing complete transmission of each scheduled packet.

Simulation results show that the BER-based codebook construction algorithm with hybrid design of power allocation and multi-mode beamforming can achieve better performance than those of equal power allocation based codebooks in literature.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.663","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411573.pdf","startPage":"3494","endPage":"3498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER-Based Codebook Construction for MIMO-OFDM Precoded Spatial Multiplexing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"BER-Based Codebook Construction for MIMO-OFDM Precoded Spatial Multiplexing Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411573/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823774","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411573/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER-Based Codebook Construction for MIMO-OFDM Precoded Spatial Multiplexing Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I13P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10385S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411574,"authors":[{"name":"Runhua Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Runhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276947000"},{"name":"Jeffrey G.

When there are a large number of base station antennas but a limited number of RF amplifiers, the system performance can be significantly improved by switching a subset of antennas to the RF chains and exploiting antenna selection diversity. The optimal antenna subset can be obtained by exhaustively searching over all possible antenna combinations. This brute-force search, however, is prohibitively complicated and impractical. To reduce the complexity, in this paper we propose several low-complexity suboptimal transmit selection algorithms that minimize a symbol error rate (SER) upper bound or maximize a capacity lower bound. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms perform very close to the optimal exhaustive search, while the complexity is much lower.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.664","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3499","endPage":"3503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Transmit Antenna Selection for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Block Diagonalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Transmit Antenna Selection for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Block Diagonalization","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411574/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823775","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411574/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Transmit Antenna Selection for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Block Diagonalization","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I13P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062576S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411575,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Tomasoni","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Agrate, Italy","Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Tomasoni","id":"37391667000"},{"name":"Massimiliano Siti","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Agrate, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Siti","id":"37391665400"},{"name":"Marco Ferrari","affiliation":["CNR-IEIIT, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37273399500"},{"name":"Sandro Bellini","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Sandro","lastName":"Bellini","id":"37283282600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411575","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":255},"abstract":"In this paper a novel Soft-Input Soft-Output detector, namely Turbo-LORD, is proposed for iterative MIMO receivers.

The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through link simulations with a 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE) specification and is compared to previous H-ARQ schemes in MIMO.

Due to the prohibitive complexity of acquiring knowledge of the fading coefficients, noncoherent space- frequency coding (NSFC) which dose not need the knowledge of channel is proposed and the design criteria is presented. However, the existing NSFCs adopt the scheme that one block occupies all the subcarriers of the OFDM system, and this large code size increases the coding and decoding complexity exponentially. In this paper, we address a new view of the transmission of space-frequency codes which transforms the transmission in frequency selective channels into flat fading channels. Then, a sub-block noncoherent space-frequency coding is proposed which divides the space-frequency plane into small sub-blocks and each one constitutes a space-frequency codeword. This reduces the code size and the coding-decoding complexity. By a modified signal model, an asymptotic analysis of the pairwise error probability (PEP) is derived and thus the design criteria for full diversity-achieving code is explicitly defined. We also propose a code construct that achieves the promised order of diversity and demonstrate our conclusion by computer simulation.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.671","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411581.pdf","startPage":"3533","endPage":"3537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-Block Noncoherent Space-Frequency Coding with Full-Diversity for MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411581/","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Block Noncoherent Space-Frequency Coding with Full-Diversity for MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823782","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411581/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Block Noncoherent Space-Frequency Coding with Full-Diversity for MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I14P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055405S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411582,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Nelson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37421005000"},{"name":"Michael Rice","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rice","id":"37280227500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411582","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Detectors","Maximum likelihood detection","Detection algorithms","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Fading","Space time codes","Modulation coding","Continuous phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","quadrature phase shift keying","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Alamouti space-time encoded offset QPSK","STC","associated detection algorithm","offset modulations","maximum likelihood detector","bit error rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411582","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411582.pdf","startPage":"3538","endPage":"3542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Alamouti Space-Time Encoded Offset QPSK","abstract":"The Alamouti space-time code (STC) is attractive because of the low complexity of its associated detection algorithm.

The interference from secondary users to primary users is constrained to be below the tolerable limit. Also, signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each secondary user is maintained higher than a desired level for QoS insurance. When network load is high, admission control needs to be performed to satisfy both QoS and interference constraints. We propose an admission control algorithm which is performed jointly with power control such that QoS requirements of all admitted secondary users are satisfied while keeping the interference to primary users below the tolerable limit. When all secondary users can be supported at minimum rates, we allow them to increase their transmission rates and share the spectrum in a fair manner. We formulate the joint power/rate allocation with max-min fairness criterion as an optimization problem. We show how to transform it into a convex optimization problem so that its globally optimal solution can be obtained. Numerical results show that the proposed admission control algorithm achieves performance very close to the optimal solution. Also, impacts of different system and QoS parameters on the network performance are investigated for both admission control and rate/power allocation problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.677","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411587.pdf","startPage":"3563","endPage":"3567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411587/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823788","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I15P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077829S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411589,"authors":[{"name":"George Alyfantis","affiliation":["Communication Networks Laboratory, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Alyfantis","id":"37424300600"},{"name":"Giannis Marias","affiliation":["Communication Networks Laboratory, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Giannis","lastName":"Marias","id":"37277504900"},{"name":"Stathes Hadjiefthymiades","affiliation":["Communication Networks Laboratory, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Stathes","lastName":"Hadjiefthymiades","id":"37280113000"},{"name":"Lazaros Merakos","affiliation":["Communication Networks Laboratory, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Lazaros","lastName":"Merakos","id":"37325938800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411589","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"abstract":"Recent studies indicate the presence of a significant amount of idle licensed spectrum, in different time periods and geographic locations.

We assume that users selfishly switch from one frequency band to another, so as to maximize their individual benefit, and model the studied problem as a non-cooperative game. We propose a probabilistic, distributed strategy with which users might share the available re sources to satisfy their quality of service requirements, and minimize their transmitted power.

In a realistic scenario, the CSIT differs from the true channel. The CSIT may be outdated due to channel variations or could be erroneous due to quantization effects and/or transmission errors. Transmit BF with reliable CSIT can improve the system performance significantly. On the other hand, pure space-time coding outperforms transmit BF if the CSIT is unreliable. The optimization criterion of the proposed robust BF scheme takes the reliability of the available CSIT in an optimum way into account. We show that the performance of the proposed robust BF scheme is upper and lower bounded by that of transmit BF with perfect CSIT and generalized delay diversity coding without instantaneous CSIT, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.681","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411591.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.681","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"3585","endPage":"3590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Transmit Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Fading Channels with Imperfect Channel Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Transmit Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Fading Channels with Imperfect Channel Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411591/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823792","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Transmit Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Fading Channels with Imperfect Channel Feedback","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I16P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069705S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411592,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Oliaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Oliaei","id":"37270628900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411592","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Energy consumption","Receiving antennas","Hardware","Signal processing","Local oscillators","Baseband","Receivers","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","data communication","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-antenna low-if beamforming","MIMO receiver","multiple data-stream communication","analog beamforming"]}],"abstract":"We present a two-antenna MIMO receiver using analog beamforming while allowing for multiple data-stream communication.

We then derive an optimal receiver as well as a formula for the resulting outage probability in terms of these noise sources. Numerical results are presented which suggest that different noise sources can impact performance in profoundly different ways.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Diversity methods","Mutual coupling","Power system modeling","Fading","MIMO","Antenna accessories","Noise figure","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","probability","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receive diversity","spatial correlation","antenna coupling","signal component","dominant physical noise sources","front-end amplifiers","matching networks","optimal receiver","outage probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.684","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411594.pdf","startPage":"3601","endPage":"3606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receive Diversity Revisited: Correlation, Coupling and Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Receive Diversity Revisited: Correlation, Coupling and Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411594/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411594/","accessionNumber":"9823795","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receive Diversity Revisited: Correlation, Coupling and Noise","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I16P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065448S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411595,"authors":[{"name":"Nevio Benvenuto","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nevio","lastName":"Benvenuto","id":"37266482000"},{"name":"Ermanna Conte","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Ermanna","lastName":"Conte","id":"37398760700"},{"name":"Stefano Tomasin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Tomasin","id":"37282514600"},{"name":"Matteo Trivellato","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Trivellato","id":"37394516900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411595","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Feedback","Mobile antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Frequency conversion","Base stations","Channel state information","Downlink","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive channel quantization","beamformer design","MIMO-BC","cellular system","frequency division duplexing","base station","multiple antennas","mobile terminals","feed back channel state information","schedule downlink transmissions","minimum mean square error","3GPP channel models"]}],"abstract":"For a cellular system based on frequency division duplexing where the base station (BS) is equipped with multiple antennas and the mobile terminals (MTs) have one antenna each, we propose joint techniques to a) feed back channel state information from MTs to the BS, b) design the beamformer and c) schedule downlink transmissions. We propose that both BS and MT predict channel variations, and the feedback (FB) information from MT to BS is given by the prediction error. For the beamformer design we both consider a zero forcing approach and investigate a new solution based on the minimum mean square error criterion, which takes into account the quantization error. By exploiting the FB information, we derive approximated expressions of the signal to noise ratio relative to each MT, used at BS to perform scheduling with an efficient greedy algorithm. Performance assessment on realistic 3GPP channel models show that the proposed techniques provide a significant improvement of the network throughput at a lower FB rate than existing solutions.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.685","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411595.pdf","startPage":"3607","endPage":"3611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Channel Quantization and Beamformer Design for MIMO-BC with Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411595/","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Channel Quantization and Beamformer Design for MIMO-BC with Limited Feedback","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823796","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411595/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Channel Quantization and Beamformer Design for MIMO-BC with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I16P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080564S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411596,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Fraidenraich","firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Fraidenraich","id":"37272285400"},{"name":"Olivier Leveque","firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Leveque","id":"37283975200"},{"name":"John M.

In this paper we consider a variety of capacity-approaching algorithms for MIMO broadcast channels. We compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of their ability to approach the sum-capacity and their fairness in sharing the channel resources amongst the multiple users. We also model distance-based attenuation effects and shadowing, yielding valuable insights into the relative performances of the algorithms under varying SNR conditions. Using a novel approach of mapping the broadcast channel to an \"equivalent' single-user channel followed by power scaling, we derive closed-form analytical approximations for the capacity of MIMO broadcast channels. For the more evenly distributed SNR case our approximations are quite accurate, suggesting an analytical lower bound for the well known iterative waterfilling solution. Finally, our Monte Carlo simulations comparing the algorithms point to an inherent tradeoff between sum-capacity and fairness.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411597.pdf","startPage":"3617","endPage":"3622","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and Fairness of MIMO Broadcast Algorithms in Shadow Fading Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Fading","Shadow mapping","Transmitters","Iterative algorithms","Downlink","Receiving antennas","Covariance matrix","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","fading channels","iterative methods","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO broadcast channel capacity","shadow fading channel","channel resource sharing","distance-based attenuation effect","SNR condition","iterative waterfilling solution","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Fairness of MIMO Broadcast Algorithms in Shadow Fading Environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411597/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823798","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Fairness of MIMO Broadcast Algorithms in Shadow Fading Environments","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I17P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07196S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411598,"authors":[{"name":"Brett T.

The proposed scheme minimizes inter-user interference (IUI) based on signal-to-leakage ratio (SLR) maximization and performs subchannel decoupling to eliminate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) within each user's signal.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.690","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411600.pdf","startPage":"3634","endPage":"3638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing in the Multi-User MIMO Downlink Based on Signal-to-Leakage Ratios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411600/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing in the Multi-User MIMO Downlink Based on Signal-to-Leakage Ratios","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823801","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411600/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Multiplexing in the Multi-User MIMO Downlink Based on Signal-to-Leakage Ratios","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I17P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069824S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411601,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37406895300"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"},{"name":"Matthew R.

The relays which decode successfully are included in the DAF group and the rest of relays, which fail to decode correctly, are included in the AAF group. The best relay, which maximizes the destination SNR, will be selected from all relays in both AAF and DAF relay groups. If it is selected from the AAF group, it will amplify the received signal while if it is selected from the DAF group, it will decode the received signals and re-encode. Results show that the proposed relay selection scheme significantly outperforms the conventional AAF selection scheme and this performance gain considerably grows as the number of relays increases. It also approaches the perfect DAF relay selection as the SNR increases.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.703","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411613.pdf","startPage":"3704","endPage":"3708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Relay Selection Scheme with Hybrid Relaying Protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411613/","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Relay Selection Scheme with Hybrid Relaying Protocols","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823814","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411613/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Relay Selection Scheme with Hybrid Relaying Protocols","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I19P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106028S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411614,"authors":[{"name":"Chan Zhou","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications (MCI), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Chan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37419685000"},{"name":"Gerhard Wunder","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications (MCI), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Wunder","id":"37283909500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411614","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Scheduling algorithm","OFDM","Broadcasting","Resource management","Throughput","Physical layer","Iterative algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","minimisation","OFDM modulation","radio networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low delay scheduling algorithm","OFDM broadcast channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","delay minimization problem","ergodic capacity region","idle state prediction algorithm","resource allocation","cross-layer optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"A new scheduling algorithm that achieves very low delay is presented in this paper and applied to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) broadcast channels (BC).

Our proposed cross-layer algorithm, called Joint Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation and Flow Control (DSA-FC) algorithm, consists of two interactive components. In the medium access control (MAC) layer, the users' expected transmission rates in terms of the number of subcarriers per symbol and their corresponding transmission priorities are evaluated. With the subcarrier gain information of each user, the physical (PHY) layer subcarrier allocation is optimally designed to satisfy the users' requirements under the system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and power constraints. In a system where the number of active users changes dynamically, the MAC-layer congestion control and removal schemes can guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of the existing users in the system and fully utilize the bandwidth resource. The proposed algorithm combines these two components, and the numerical results show that it significantly improves the system performance in terms of the bandwidth efficiency and delay performance for real-time services.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation and Flow Control for Real-Time Streaming Over Multiuser OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.706","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411616.pdf","startPage":"3719","endPage":"3723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation and Flow Control for Real-Time Streaming Over Multiuser OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411616/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823817","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation and Flow Control for Real-Time Streaming Over Multiuser OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I20P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056073S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411617,"authors":[{"name":"Kainan Zhou","affiliation":["School of Infocomm Technology, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kainan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37271501900"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Huat","lastName":"Chew","id":"37280653600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411617","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Linear programming","Computational complexity","Resource management","Iterative algorithms","Quality of service","Frequency diversity","Switches","Bit rate","Lagrangian functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","integer programming","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic solutions","adaptive subcarrier-and-bit allocation","multiclass multiuser OFDM systems","nonlinear integer programming","quality-of-service","instantaneous total system revenue","QoS","bit error rate","data rate","quadratic fitting scheme","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Subcarrier-and-bit allocation (SBA) has been extensively investigated in the literature to improve spectral efficiency of multiuser OFDM systems. In this paper, the analysis of adaptive SBA for multiclass multiuser OFDM systems which is generally formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem is presented, whose solution is highly intricate. Some measures are conducted to ensure convexity and to reduce computational complexity, and the optimal solution to the modified equivalent problem is derived. The instantaneous total system revenue is maximized with the quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of data rate and bit error rate of each class guaranteed.

Correlation tensor methods are based on the reduced order approximations of the full channel covariance, and do not require any a priori knowledge about the physical scattering mechanism or antenna array. Directional methods require knowledge about the array configuration and usually assume a double-directional wave-propagation mechanism. Five different tensor methods (Kronecker, separable maximum entropy, Weichselberger, principal hyperplane, and sparse core tensor) and one directional method (unstructured diffuse spectrum estimation) are compared in terms of the number of parameters required and the match to the true full covariance matrix. Simulations with a realistic cluster channel model indicate that tensor methods suffer from poor accuracy when too few values in the core tensor are retained, especially when no joint transmit/receive information is available. The directional method, on the other hand, has good accuracy with the same number of parameters as the simplest tensor model. The results stress the importance of including joint transmit/receive information in MIMO models and suggest that directional modeling is a logical choice for high accuracy modeling with few parameters.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.712","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411622.pdf","startPage":"3750","endPage":"3754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate MIMO Channel Modeling: Correlation Tensor vs. Directional Approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411622/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate MIMO Channel Modeling: Correlation Tensor vs. Directional Approaches","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823822","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411622/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate MIMO Channel Modeling: Correlation Tensor vs. Directional Approaches","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I21P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049343S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411623,"authors":[{"name":"Hani Mehrpouyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hani","lastName":"Mehrpouyan","id":"37397432300"},{"name":"Steven D.

Therefore models that enable simulation of dynamic and time varying channels in a computationally scalable fashion are extremely valuable. Previously, the application of auto regressive moving average (ARMA) modeling to fading processes has been complicated by ill-conditioning and nonlinear parameter estimation. This paper presents a numerically stable and accurate method to synthesize ARMA rational approximations of correlated Rayleigh fading processes from more complex higher order representations. The resulting ARMA synthesis is then used in the generation of dynamic MIMO channel realizations with time varying Doppler at significantly lower computational complexities.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.713","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3755","endPage":"3759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARMA Synthesis of Fading Channels- an Application to the Generation of Dynamic MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ARMA Synthesis of Fading Channels- an Application to the Generation of Dynamic MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411623/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823823","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARMA Synthesis of Fading Channels- an Application to the Generation of Dynamic MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I21P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049713S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411624,"authors":[{"name":"Alenka G.

Fixed scatterers like buildings, mountains and tree stems do not move, while non-fixed (moving) scatterers like cars, people and tree leaves move from their initial positions. In addition to different movements of the mobile station (MS) that cause different kinds of Doppler fading, movements of non-fixed scatterers are also anticipated to generate other kinds of fading/correlation. This fading changes depend on the type of the propagation environment and the type of movements of local surrounding scatterers. In this paper we characterize these effects in terms of temporal correlations. In this study we assume constant speed for the MS and random displacements for scatterers based on stationary-increment Wiener vector process. As it will be verified, these random movements have direct effect on the channel process power spectral density (PSD).","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.715","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411625.pdf","startPage":"3765","endPage":"3769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Fixed Scatterers and Their Effects on MIMO Multicarrier Fading Communication Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411625/","displayDocTitle":"Non-Fixed Scatterers and Their Effects on MIMO Multicarrier Fading Communication Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823825","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411625/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Fixed Scatterers and Their Effects on MIMO Multicarrier Fading Communication Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I21P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046959S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411630,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Kin Au-Yeung","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Systems and Applications School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chun Kin","lastName":"Au-Yeung","id":"38275255400"},{"name":"Seung Young Park","affiliation":["Kangwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Young","lastName":"Park","id":"37280890500"},{"name":"David J.

We focus on an OFDM WLAN system operating in license-exempt band and analyze synchronization performance when NBI is active. The proposed method does not introduce any additional preamble overhead with respect to existing WLAN preamble and requires only slightly higher computational complexity at the receiver.

Unfortunately, in OFDMA uplink scenarios, high peak-to-average power ratios (PARs) dramatically degrade the power efficiency of the mobile users. This turns out to be one of the most critical problems when implementing OFDMA systems. In this paper, we propose efficient PAR reduction schemes based upon tone reservation. We show by simulation that the PAR can be significantly reduced without incurring multiple- access interference and with a very small loss in bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411632.pdf","startPage":"3802","endPage":"3806","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA Uplink PAR Reduction via Tone Reservation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Frequency conversion","Bandwidth","Australia","Wireless networks","Degradation","Intersymbol interference","Frequency division multiaccess","Multiple access interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA uplink PAR reduction scheme","tone reservation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","broadband wireless networks","peak-to-average power ratio","multiple-access interference","mobile users"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA Uplink PAR Reduction via Tone Reservation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411632/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823832","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA Uplink PAR Reduction via Tone Reservation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I23P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032634S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4411632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411634,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Senst","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Senst","id":"37546429900"},{"name":"Markus Jordan","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Jordan","id":"37395352500"},{"name":"Meik Dorpinghaus","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Meik","lastName":"Dorpinghaus","id":"37425852600"},{"name":"Michael Farber","affiliation":["SN MN PG NT RI 1, Siemens Networks GmbH & Company KG, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Farber","id":"37840162600"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"},{"name":"Heinrich Meyr","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Heinrich","lastName":"Meyr","id":"37275970000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM modulation","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Base stations","Multiple access interference","Signal processing","Tin","Frequency conversion","Oscillators","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio","out-of-band power","OFDM systems","optimization","joint reduction algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The high peak-to-average power ratio is a major drawback of OFDM systems. Many PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed in the literature, among them a method that uses a subset of tones that do not carry any data, but are modulated such that the PAPR of the resulting time domain signal is minimized. Another problem of OFDM systems is the high out-of-band power caused by the sidelobes of the modulated tones. The OBP can be reduced by modulating reserved tones at the edges of the occupied spectrum so that the sidelobes of the data carriers are reduced. In this paper, we propose to consider both optimization problems jointly. This way, the amount of PAPR and OBP reduction can be significantly enhanced in comparison to a system that performs two separate optimization steps. Furthermore, the joint reduction algorithm offers more flexibility, because the relative weighting of the two optimization criteria can easily be changed, resulting in a smooth trade-off curve.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Reduction of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio and Out-of-Band Power in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.724","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411634.pdf","startPage":"3812","endPage":"3816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Reduction of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio and Out-of-Band Power in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411634/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823834","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Reduction of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio and Out-of-Band Power in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I23P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053752S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411635,"authors":[{"name":"Imene Trigui","affiliation":["Cit\u00e9 Technologique des Communications, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Imene","lastName":"Trigui","id":"37391799000"},{"name":"Mohammed Siala","affiliation":["Cit\u00e9 Technologique des Communications, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"},{"name":"Sofiene Affes","affiliation":["INRS-\u00c9MT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofiene","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Alex Stephenne","affiliation":["Ericsson Canada, Montreal, QUE, Canada","INRS-\u00c9MT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Stephenne","id":"37294239900"},{"name":"Hatem Boujemaa","affiliation":["Cit\u00e9 Technologique des Communications, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hatem","lastName":"Boujemaa","id":"37327151300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411635","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse shaping methods","OFDM","Time varying systems","Intersymbol interference","Dispersion","Time frequency analysis","Bit rate","Robustness","Lattices","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum pulse shaping","OFDM/BFDM systems","time varying multipath channels","doubly dispersive channel","signal to interference ratio","SIR","inter-symbol interference","inter-carrier interference","ICI","ISI","time frequency localization","transmit pulses","receive pulses","multicarrier system","channel dispersion"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a pulse shaping OFDM/BFDM system operating over a doubly dispersive channel.

Both air interfaces are highly sensitive to phase noise (PN) that degrades their system performances. In this paper, we study and compare analytically the PN impact on both air interfaces. Simulations are also carried out to validate the analytical results. PN causes the same common phase error (CPE) on both air interfaces, as well as it leads to Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) in OFDM and inter-symbol interference (ISI) in SC-CP. However OFDM is found to be slightly less affected than SC-CP in both flat channels and frequency selective channels.

The combination of the MMEA with the principle of set partitioning is also proposed here as an efficient way to improve the performance of the simulator and to reduce the computational costs. Such a combination results in a new parameter computation method called MMEA with set partitioning (MMEA-SP). The MMEA and the MMEA-SP are quite general and can be applied on any given distribution of the angle of arrival (AOA).

The effect of correlation on the performance of the relay networks is analyzed for the cases where full knowledge of correlation is available at the relays and when there is no knowledge about the correlation structure. Interestingly we find that, on the average, noise correlation is beneficial regardless of whether the relays know the noise covariance matrix or not. However, the knowledge of correlation can greatly improve the performance. Typically, the performance improvement from correlation knowledge increases with the relay power and the number of relays. With perfect correlation knowledge the system is capable of canceling interference if the number of interferers is less than the number of relays.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411645.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.735","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"3868","endPage":"3872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Distributed Beamforming in Relay Networks with Common Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Distributed Beamforming in Relay Networks with Common Interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411645/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823845","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Distributed Beamforming in Relay Networks with Common Interference","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I25P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047741S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411646,"authors":[{"name":"Erhan Yilmaz","affiliation":["Department of Mobile Communications, Institut Eur\u00e9com, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Erhan","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37625964800"},{"name":"M.

We consider a system where the source node multiplexes the information into parallel streams and uses disjoint subsets of relays to assist the transmission of each stream. Furthermore, we assume that the source and the destination have the same number of antennas and that each transmit antenna is virtually paired to a different destination antenna. We consider source node channel side information (CSI) availability of just the source-relay and source-destination links, and propose a source beamforming method based on maximizing the sum of signal-to-leakage ratios (SSLR) for all of the data streams. This method maximizes the sum of signal strengths at the set of relay nodes assigned to that stream while suppressing the interference to other relay nodes. Maximizing the SSLR reduces the propagation of interference terms in the AF strategy and results in significant performance gains.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.736","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411646.pdf","startPage":"3873","endPage":"3877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Capacity with Transmit Beamforming for MIMO Multiple-Relay Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411646/","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Capacity with Transmit Beamforming for MIMO Multiple-Relay Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823846","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411646/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-Forward Capacity with Transmit Beamforming for MIMO Multiple-Relay Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I25P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051211S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411647,"authors":[{"name":"Byung Yi","affiliation":["LG Electronics Mobile Research, USA"],"firstName":"Byung","lastName":"Yi","id":"37273971100"},{"name":"Shu Wang","affiliation":["LG Electronics Mobile Research, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37835624600"},{"name":"Soon Y.

The source (mobile equipment) of the proposed system has a very simple transmitter structure with constant amplitude transmit sequences. In order to obtain spatial diversity, the transmit sequence of relay is efficiently generated in the time domain, which is equivalent to the SFBC. The corresponding destination structure and frequency domain equalization are also presented.

We compare the differences between real and complex signal model in the LSD algorithm implementation and study its impact on the complexity and performance with different search strategies. In hardware implementation, the number of visited nodes needs to be bounded in order to determine the complexity and the latency of the implementation. Thus, we study the performance of LSD algorithms with a limited number of nodes in the search.

The scaling factor is optimized according to the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart of the SISO detector. Simulation results show that the proposed MF- based iterative receiver significantly outperforms the conventional one with little additional cost in computational complexity and achieves bit error rate (BER) performance comparable to that of the MMSE-based iterative receiver with much lower complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.751","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411661.pdf","startPage":"3953","endPage":"3957","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaled Matched Filter Based Iterative Receiver for Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Scaled Matched Filter Based Iterative Receiver for Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411661/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823861","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaled Matched Filter Based Iterative Receiver for Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I28P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115965S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4411662,"authors":[{"name":"May Gomaa","affiliation":["ECE Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"May","lastName":"Gomaa","id":"37702943000"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["ECE Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411662","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","MIMO","Decoding","Computer architecture","Performance analysis","Performance gain","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multiplexing","space-time codes","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transceiver architecture","multilayered space-time coding","multiple-input multiple-output systems","MIMO systems","threaded space-time coding","low complexity detection","spatial interleaver","encoder","low-complexity decoder","minimum mean squared error","QR decomposition","diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off","multiuser environments"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new transceiver architecture for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed scheme borrows ideas from the multilayered space-time coding (MLSTC) and threaded space-time coding (TSTC) schemes in an effort to maximize the diversity order while maintaining a low complexity detection. Specifically, the proposed scheme has a structure similar to that of the MLSTC while it employs a spatial interleaver (SI) in front of the MLSTC encoder. We also consider a low-complexity decoder that is based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion and the QR decomposition (QRD). We provide analytical and simulation results through which we demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides improved diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off, as well as improved performance, all relative to the MLSTC scheme.

The proposed scheme updates the precoding matrix by multiplying the codebook matrix specified by the receiver to the previous precoding matrix.

We analyze the capacity of the differential precoding scheme as well as existing precoding schemes by taking into account various practical aspects such as precoding update interval, feedback delay, and feedback error. Simulation results show that in a MIMO system with four transmit and two receive antennas, the proposed precoding scheme requires smaller codebook size by about 1 - 2 bits than the one-shot precoding scheme with Grassmannian codebook to achieve the same capacity level when the channel variation is relatively small. Finally, we show that the proposed precoding scheme provides similar throughput performance gain in MIMO-OFDM systems in frequency selective fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.753","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411663.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3963","endPage":"3968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Codebook MIMO Precoding Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differential Codebook MIMO Precoding Technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411663/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823863","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411663/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Codebook MIMO Precoding Technique","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I28P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046283S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411664,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Tae Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Tae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37539571900"},{"name":"Seokhwan Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokhwan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293216300"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411664","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new power allocation algorithm for orthogonalized spatial multiplexing (OSM) systems over flat-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.

Based on correct modeling of the correlation between channel estimates and received signals with carrier frequency offset and receiver I/Q imbalance, the SER can be numerically evaluated by averaging symbol error rates on different subcarriers using an analytical expression of double integrals. The results illustrate that the analysis can approximate the simulative performance very accurately if the power delay profile of fading channels, the receiver I/Q imbalance parameters and carrier frequency offset are known.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.758","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"3989","endPage":"3994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol Error Rate Calculation for Alamouti Space Time Coded OFDM in Direct Conversion Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symbol Error Rate Calculation for Alamouti Space Time Coded OFDM in Direct Conversion Receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411668/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823868","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411668/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol Error Rate Calculation for Alamouti Space Time Coded OFDM in Direct Conversion Receivers","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I29P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091213S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411669,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Saegusa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chiba Institute of Technology, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Saegusa","id":"37828251800"},{"name":"Takahiko Saba","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chiba Institute of Technology, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiko","lastName":"Saba","id":"37283697900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411669","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Fading","OFDM","Decoding","Frequency diversity","Diversity methods","Degradation","Computer science","Space technology","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","fading channels","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercode interference cancellation","frequency selective fading environments","time selective fading environments","space-time-frequency block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"In space-time-frequency block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (STFBC-OFDM), data symbols are encoded over several antennas, several symbol intervals, and several subcarriers.

We consider a CDMA system with forward error correction that employs iterative multiuser detection based on soft interference cancellation and single user decoding. The J function is useful in convergence analysis as it provides a mapping between mutual information and variance. J functions are derived for both the flat-fading Rayleigh channel and channel estimate, allowing the a priori inputs to the channel estimator, interference canceller and decoder to be modeled. Algorithms for obtaining the EXIT functions for the three receiver blocks are proposed. We then combine the EXIT functions to create an EXIT chart that can be used to predict the behaviour of the overall receiver. Simulations are run for a 3GPP-like receiver in a mobile environment with a vehicle speed of 100 km/h. It is found that under these conditions, the detector trajectory closely matches our proposed EXIT chart.","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411672.pdf","startPage":"4010","endPage":"4014","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EXIT Chart Analysis of an Iterative Receiver with Channel Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"EXIT Chart Analysis of an Iterative Receiver with Channel Estimation","htmlLink":"/document/4411672/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823872","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EXIT Chart Analysis of an Iterative Receiver with Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I30P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040218S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4411672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411673,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Cui","id":"37277084800"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Arumugam Nallanathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Arumugam","lastName":"Nallanathan","id":"37269846800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411673","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Relays","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Broadcasting","Decoding","Power system relaying","Least squares approximation","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","encoding","least mean squares methods","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","amplify-and-forward relay networks","optimal training design","amplify-and-forward transmission","space time coding","linear least-square estimator","minimum mean- square-error estimator","optimal training sequences","optimal precoding matrices","multiple antennas","transmitters"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study training based channel estimation for relay networks using the amplify-and-forward (AF) transmission scheme.

Based on these, we further provide analytical expressions for error rate of BF systems. Our results show that for channels with non-bandlimited fading spectra, the error rate performance monotonically degrades when the feedback delay increases. On the other hand, for channels with bandlimited fading spectra the error rate may not monotonically degrades as the delay goes to infinity. However, delayed feedback may cause the transmit diversity gain being reduced to one for high SNRs, that is, no diversity gain but only an array gain is attained. The performance loss caused by delayed feedback may be much more detrimental than the limited-rate feedback for all SNRs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"4071","endPage":"4075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411684.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Rate of Transmit Beamforming with Delayed and Limited Feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411684/","displayDocTitle":"Error Rate of Transmit Beamforming with Delayed and Limited Feedback","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823884","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Rate of Transmit Beamforming with Delayed and Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I32P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074643S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411685,"authors":[{"name":"Magnus Sandell","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Sandell","id":"37269836200"},{"name":"Vishakan Ponnampalam","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Vishakan","lastName":"Ponnampalam","id":"37269015400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411685","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411685","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Channel estimation","Telecommunication computing","MIMO","OFDM","Interpolation","Transmitters","Smoothing methods","Degradation","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interpolation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming weight computation","MIMO","OFDM","channel estimation","IEEE802.11n system","channel smoothing","linear interpolation","beamforming matrices"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.775","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411685.pdf","startPage":"4076","endPage":"4080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smooth Beamforming and Efficient Beamforming Weight Computation","abstract":"This paper investigates an efficient way of computing the beamforming weights for a MIMO OFDM system.

An additional benefit of this technique is that it provides a \"smooth\" beamformer, i.e., it does not significantly change the correlation of the beamformed channel, which makes it suitable for advanced channel estimation techniques. We evaluate its performance in the OFDM-based IEEE802.11n system, where the computations are done across the subcarriers, and show that significant gains from channel smoothing at the receiver are possible due to the smooth beamformer. We also show that linear interpolation of beamforming matrices between subcarriers can be used, which only has a small degradation compared to optimal interpolation but a much simple implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411685/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9823885","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411685/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Smooth Beamforming and Efficient Beamforming Weight Computation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smooth Beamforming and Efficient Beamforming Weight Computation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I32P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052235S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411686,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Wu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Sang Wu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279270400"},{"name":"Zhengdao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengdao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411686","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":435},"abstract":"We present a new maximum ratio combining (MRC) technique that performs the maximum ratio combining at the radio frequency (RF) level, thereby requiring only one RF chain and one matched filter.

Simulation results show that the framework performs well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411699.pdf","startPage":"4150","endPage":"4154","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-Assisted OFDM Channel Estimation and ICI Cancellation for Double Selective Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Mobile communication","Discrete Fourier transforms","Interference cancellation","Time domain analysis","Sampling methods","Floors","Time factors","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-assisted OFDM channel estimation","ICI cancellation","double selective channels","basis expansion model","Doppler frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-Assisted OFDM Channel Estimation and ICI Cancellation for Double Selective Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411699/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823899","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-Assisted OFDM Channel Estimation and ICI Cancellation for Double Selective Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I34P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046661S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411700,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["Canberra Research Laboratory, NICTA, Braddon, Australia","Research School of Information Science and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38184221500"},{"name":"Zhenning Shi","affiliation":["Research School of Information Science and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhenning","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278371900"},{"name":"Mark C.

When a large bandwidth cognitive radio transceiver performs carrier-sensing, it must receive a radio wave that includes many primary user transmissions. The radio wave may have high peak to average power ratio and clipping noise may be generated. Clipping noise becomes an obstacle to the achievement of high- sensitivity carrier-sensing In the proposed technique, the original values of the samples clipped by an ADC are estimated by interpolation. Polynomial spline interpolation to the clipped signal is performed in the first step, and then SINC function interpolation is applied to the spline interpolated signal. The performance was evaluated and about 20 dB suppression of clipping noise was achieved with the medium degree of clipping.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823903","htmlLink":"/document/4411703/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A/D Converter Clipping Noise Suppression for High-Sensitivity Carrier-Sensing of Cognitive Radio Transceiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A/D Converter Clipping Noise Suppression for High-Sensitivity Carrier-Sensing of Cognitive Radio Transceiver","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I35P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040918S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411704,"authors":[{"name":"Theodoros Kamakaris","affiliation":["Wireless Network Security Center, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Theodoros","lastName":"Kamakaris","id":"37564043200"},{"name":"Didem Kivanc-Tureli","affiliation":["Wireless Network Security Center, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Didem","lastName":"Kivanc-Tureli","id":"38339764300"},{"name":"Uf Tureli","affiliation":["Wireless Network Security Center, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Uf","lastName":"Tureli","id":"37275337400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411704","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Cellular networks","Next generation networking","Bandwidth","Spatial coherence","TV","Frequency conversion","Radiofrequency interference","Cognitive radio","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference model","cognitive coexistence","cellular systems","cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum access","spectrum scarcity problem","opportunistic bandwidth","cellular network","spatial evaluation","resources spatial coherence","interference region","communications region"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio is a key enabling technology of dynamic spectrum access for exploiting unused spectrum resources.

Specifically, we consider two coding schemes, rateless coding and piecewise coding. Both coding schemes have small overhead, as well as low-complexity encoding and decoding. The proposed piecewise coding also enjoys the advantages of parallel decoding and fast response to packet loss. For piecewise coding, we propose two design methods to build short block codes with small number of parity checks by incorporating the jamming rate. We analyze the throughput performance of the secondary users systems employing either anti-jamming coding technique. The performance results demonstrate that both coding techniques provide reliable transmission with high throughput and small redundancy. The piecewise coding using the designed short codes provides better performance with smaller overhead if the jamming rate is not high.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9823907","htmlLink":"/document/4411707/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Anti-Jamming Coding for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Anti-Jamming Coding for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I35P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051928S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411708,"authors":[{"name":"Pengcheng Zhu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37402801500"},{"name":"Lan Tang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37288310700"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293648300"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411708","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Diversity methods","MIMO","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","error statistics","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit beamforming system","finite rate feedback","feedback error","outage probability","bit error rate","uniform symmetric channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411708","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.798","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","abstract":"In this paper, we consider transmit beamforming systems with finite rate feedback and feedback errors.

We consider a space-time transmit diversity (STTD) scheme using the Alamouti code and a simple switch transmit diversity (STD) scheme in which the transmitter selects instantaneously the best antenna for transmission. Receiver impairment is generally modeled as a colored, complex Gaussian process, which gives rise to temporal and spatial correlations. First, we extend the G-Rake formulation to process a STTD signal, accounting for the space-time code structure as well as the temporal and spatial correlations of the impairments. The performance of STTD and STD for a WCDMA system is then evaluated. We show that STTD improves the coverage of low-to-medium rate services significantly for users at cell edge compared to the scheme without transmit diversity. Such improvements are observed even when the channels already have diversity through multipath and multiple receive antennas. Thus, STTD is well suited for broadcast when feedback from mobiles is not available. For high-data-rate availability, however, using one feedback bit to allow the STD scheme to transmit only on the better antenna achieves significantly better performance compared to STTD. This is because sending the desired signal through one radio channel makes it easier for linear equalizers to restore orthogonality. For mobiles dominated by self-interference due to loss of orthogonality, better equalization results in much improved data rates.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.800","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411710.pdf","startPage":"4205","endPage":"4209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Diversity and Receiver Performance in a WCDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411710/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Diversity and Receiver Performance in a WCDMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823910","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411710/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Diversity and Receiver Performance in a WCDMA System","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I36P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069149S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411711,"authors":[{"name":"Armin Dammann","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dammann","id":"37269758600"},{"name":"Ronald Raulefs","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Raulefs","id":"37269755900"},{"name":"Simon Plass","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Plass","id":"37266454000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411711","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Digital video broadcasting","Antennas and propagation","Fading","System performance","Propagation losses","Switches","Antenna feeds","Additive white noise","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft cyclic delay diversity","DVB-T","Rician channels","Rayleigh fading channel","line-of-sight propagation","transmit antenna power distribution","terrestrial digital video broadcasting system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411711","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411711.pdf","startPage":"4210","endPage":"4214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Cyclic Delay Diversity and its Performance for DVB-T in Ricean Channels","abstract":"Cyclic delay diversity (CDD) provides additional diversity in Rayleigh fading channels, and therefore, improves the system performance. For line-of-sight (LOS) propagation, e.g., the additive white Gaussian noise channel, the implementation of CDD yields to a performance loss. The power distribution among the transmit (TX) antenna branches is a further parameter which can freely be chosen for optimizing the system performance and allows to switch on/off CDD softly. The idea is to feed different power levels into the multiple TX antenna branches rather than distributing the TX power uniformly among the TX antennas. We exemplarily implement the soft CDD principle to the terrestrial digital video broadcasting system (DVB-T). We consider a Ricean multipath fading channel, which allows to control the ratio of LOS and non-LOS propagation power via the Ricean factor for simulations. Simulation results for 2-TX and 4-TX antenna CDD show that antenna power weighting significantly reduces the SNR loss in LOS propagation by the cost of a slight degradation of the SNR gain in non-LOS scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411711/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823911","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Soft Cyclic Delay Diversity and its Performance for DVB-T in Ricean Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Cyclic Delay Diversity and its Performance for DVB-T in Ricean Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I36P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07232S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411714,"authors":[{"name":"Marilynn P.

In a recent generalization, it has been shown that a similar finite-term amplitude modulation expansion exists for all variants of CPM, regardless of signal complexity, with the important distinction that the amplitude modulated pulses are, generally, data-dependent. Furthermore, it has been shown that most of the signal power is typically concentrated in the first 1-2 principle components of the expansion, which suggests a possible reduction in receiver complexity viz. the optimal maximum likelihood sequence detector.

It is shown that a link between QL-factorization of the channel matrix and minimum-phase prefiltering exists. As a result, it is possible to regard SD as a generalization of traditional reduced- state sequence estimation, providing a unifying framework for the two detection methods. It is illustrated how minimum-phase prefiltering or the linear minimum mean-square error decision feedback equalization (LMMSE-DFE) forward filter is capable of reducing the complexity of sphere detectors significantly, while still obtaining near-optimal performance. The significant reduction in complexity is obtained as prefiltering enables earlier decision making in SD. Simulations carried out in an EDGE system confirm that prefiltering leads to a considerable complexity reduction for sphere detectors.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.806","startPage":"4237","endPage":"4241","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411716.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Sphere Detection and Minimum-Phase Prefiltered Reduced-State Sequence Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"On Sphere Detection and Minimum-Phase Prefiltered Reduced-State Sequence Estimation","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411716/","accessionNumber":"9823916","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411716/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Sphere Detection and Minimum-Phase Prefiltered Reduced-State Sequence Estimation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I37P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050344S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4411717,"authors":[{"name":"Luay Azzam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Luay","lastName":"Azzam","id":"37692561300"},{"name":"Ender Ayanoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Ender","lastName":"Ayanoglu","id":"37274938000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411717","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Lattices","Maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO","Receiving antennas","AWGN","Maximum likelihood detection","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital communication","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity sphere decoding","square QAM","lattice representation","low complexity maximum likelihood detection algorithm","linear channels","digital communications","floating point operations per second","FLOPS"]}],"abstract":"Sphere decoding (SD) is a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithm, which has been adapted for different linear channels in digital communications. The complexity of SD has been shown to be exponential in some cases, and polynomial in others and under certain assumptions. The sphere radius and the number of nodes visited throughout the tree traversal search are the decisive factors for the complexity of the algorithm. The radius problem has been addressed and treated widely in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new structure for SD, which drastically reduces the overall complexity. The complexity is measured in terms of the floating point operations per second (FLOPS) and the number of nodes visited throughout the algorithm's tree search. This reduction in complexity is due to the ability of decoding the real and imaginary parts of every jointly detected symbol independently of each other, making use of the new lattice representation. We further show by simulations that the new approach achieves 80% reduction in the overall complexity compared to the conventional SD for a 2times2 system, and almost 50% reduction for the 4times4 and 6times6 cases, thus relaxing the requirements for hardware implementation.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.807","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411717.pdf","startPage":"4242","endPage":"4246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Complexity Sphere Decoding for Square QAM via a New Lattice Representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411717/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Complexity Sphere Decoding for Square QAM via a New Lattice Representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823917","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411717/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Complexity Sphere Decoding for Square QAM via a New Lattice Representation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I37P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065443S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411718,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Samuel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Samuel","id":"37394142100"},{"name":"Michael P.

In the proposed distributed interference cancellation (DIC) scheme, during phase-1 of transmission, an MUD capable cooperating relay node estimates all the sender nodes' bits through multistage interference cancellation. These estimated bits are then sent by the relay node on orthogonal tones in phase-2 of transmission. The destination nodes receive these bit estimates and use them for interference estimation/cancellation, thus achieving IC benefit in a distributed manner. For this DIC scheme, we analytically derive an exact expression for the bit error rate (BER) in a basic five-node network (two source-destination node pairs and a cooperating relay node) on AWGN channels. Analytical BER results are shown to match with simulation results. For more general system scenarios, including more than two source-destination pairs and fading channels without and with space-time coding, we present simulation results to establish the potential for improved performance in the proposed distributed approach to interference cancellation. We also present a linear version of the proposed DIC.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.809","startPage":"4253","endPage":"4257","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411719.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Approach to Interference Cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Approach to Interference Cancellation","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411719/","accessionNumber":"9823919","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411719/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Approach to Interference Cancellation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I37P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04606S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4411720,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Hijazi","affiliation":["CNRS INPG, GIBSA-Laboratory, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Hijazi","id":"37391828900"},{"name":"Laurent Ros","affiliation":["CNRS INPG, GIBSA-Laboratory, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Ros","id":"37285032000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411720","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":150},"abstract":"In this paper, we present an iterative algorithm for channel complex gains estimation with inter-sub-carrier- interference (ICI) reduction in orthogonal-frequency-division- multiplexing downlink mobile communication systems using comb-type pilot.

Simulation results for the performance are presented in terms of bit error rate (BER) vs signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), showing how the single-user bound (SUB) is approached in a few iterations.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.811","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411721.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"4263","endPage":"4268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Iterative Time-Variant Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Iterative Time-Variant Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411721/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823921","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411721/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Iterative Time-Variant Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I38P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066122S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411722,"authors":[{"name":"Shigang Tang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shigang","lastName":"Tang","id":"37286739400"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292384500"},{"name":"Kewu Peng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kewu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37274592000"},{"name":"Changyong Pan","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changyong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37280267400"},{"name":"Ke Gong","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Gong","id":"37282452500"},{"name":"Zhixing Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhixing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280277800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411722","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Time domain analysis","OFDM","Convolution","Intersymbol interference","Interference cancellation","Proposals","Frequency estimation","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","time-domain analysis","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative channel impulse response estimation","multicarrier block transmission","symbol padding","QPSK TDS-OFDM","time-domain synchronous OFDM","circular convolution relationship","one- tap frequency-domain equalization","FFT","16QAM constellations","mean square error","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"This study proposes an iterative channel impulse response (CIR) estimation scheme for multicarrier block transmission with known symbol padding, in the context of the time-domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) system.

While conventional methods perform the channel estimation based on the cyclic prefix reconstruction or residual intersymbol interference cancellation in the time domain, by processing the data part and the known symbol padding in one TDS-OFDM block separately, the new proposal uses the one- tap frequency-domain equalization to separate the data part and the known symbol padding and the CIR can be estimated in an iterative manner.

Direct-conversion radio frequency transceivers are appealing because they avoid costly IF analog components. This kind of transceivers imply analog RF I/Q separation. The mismatch between the analog components in the in-phase and quadrature branches introduces an unwanted in-band interference. Unfortunately, OFDM-based systems are very sensitive to I/Q mismatch, mostly when high order modulation schemes are applied. A digital compensation of this unwanted effect is required. In this paper, we developed an iterative method for estimating and compensating the transmitter/receiver frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance jointly with the propagation channel in the frequency domain. The new estimation technique resorts to the iterative Expectation- Maximization algorithm in order converge to the ML estimation for both channel and IQ imbalance coefficients in presence of unknown transmitted data symbols. Although the the estimation may be perform in the absence of known pilot symbols, the algorithm provides flexibility in terms of pilot sequence, allocation and load in order to improve its convergence. An advanced low complexity equalizer is proposed which compensates for the frequency-dependent IQ imbalance. Simulation results show optimal performance even in the absence of any pilot symbol and large IQ mismatches. The proposed technique enables the system to achieve high SNRs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM Based Frequency-Dependent Transmit/Receive IQ Imbalance Estimation and Compensation in OFDM-Based Transceivers","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.813","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411723.pdf","startPage":"4274","endPage":"4279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"EM Based Frequency-Dependent Transmit/Receive IQ Imbalance Estimation and Compensation in OFDM-Based Transceivers","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411723/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823923","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM Based Frequency-Dependent Transmit/Receive IQ Imbalance Estimation and Compensation in OFDM-Based Transceivers","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I38P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049945S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411724,"authors":[{"name":"Rabih Chrabieh","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rabih","lastName":"Chrabieh","id":"37828002400"},{"name":"Samir Soliman","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Soliman","id":"38182046500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411724","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":215},"abstract":"Modern digital communication systems use quadrature modulation (IQ) such as QAM.

In contrast to existing literature, this paper considers a more practical perspective and presents a strategy where a minimum rate per user is required, which can only be guaranteed under a certain system outage restriction. Within this scenario, the paper then formulates the minimum rate and maximum/mean delay expressions in closed form expressions. Furthermore, in opportunistic schemes a high number of users is required to improve the sum rate system performance, but for practical considerations, a large number of available users induces a large service delay. A dynamic call admission control (CAC) is then proposed to regulate the number of users, and to guarantee the service to all the users in the cell under rate and delay requirements. The derived expressions are then tested via simulations in several transmission scenarios, where users running delay-constrained (DC) and delay-tolerant (DT) applications coexist.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411727.pdf","startPage":"4296","endPage":"4300","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAC for Multibeam Opportunistic Schemes in Heterogeneous WiMax Systems Under QoS Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Quality of service","System performance","Sprites (computer)","Transmitters","Array signal processing","Availability","Delay effects","Telecommunications","Irrigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","scheduling","telecommunication congestion control","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam opportunistic schemes","QoS","spatial scheduling","heterogeneous WiMax downlink channel","partial channel state information","service delay","call admission control","delay constraint","delay tolerance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"CAC for Multibeam Opportunistic Schemes in Heterogeneous WiMax Systems Under QoS Constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411727/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823927","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAC for Multibeam Opportunistic Schemes in Heterogeneous WiMax Systems Under QoS Constraints","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I39P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055621S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411729,"authors":[{"name":"Takeo Ohseki","affiliation":["Radio Access Laboratory, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Ohseki","id":"37270507300"},{"name":"Megumi Morita","affiliation":["Radio Access Laboratory, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Megumi","lastName":"Morita","id":"37667719800"},{"name":"Takashi Inoue","affiliation":["Radio Access Laboratory, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37280049700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411729","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":254},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a burst construction and packet mapping scheme in the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) downlinks of IEEE 802.16 systems. In the standard of the systems, there are some restrictions on the usage of downlink radio resources and they are defined in the physical layer (PHY) specification. One of the main restrictions is that a rectangular region, which is called Burst, is defined on a two-dimensional domain of time and frequency, and packets must be allocated within the region. However, how to define the burst and allocate data packets within the burst is left implementation dependent. Therefore, we consider a burst construction and packet mapping scheme that is easy to realize on systems and attains efficient usage of radio resources. By computer simulation, it has been confirmed that the proposed scheme can decrease not only the control data ratio within the rectangles, but also control data that must be transmitted at the head of every frame, which can result in higher throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411729.pdf","startPage":"4307","endPage":"4311","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Burst Construction and Packet Mapping Scheme for OFDMA Downlinks in IEEE 802.16 Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Physical layer","Computer simulation","Laboratories","Radio spectrum management","Throughput","Multimedia communication","Streaming media","Multimedia systems","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","IEEE standards","packet switching","radio links","telecommunication standards","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst construction","packet mapping scheme","OFDMA downlinks","IEEE 802.16 systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access downlinks","downlink radio resources","physical layer specification","rectangular region","2D time-frequency domain analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Burst Construction and Packet Mapping Scheme for OFDMA Downlinks in IEEE 802.16 Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411729/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823929","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Burst Construction and Packet Mapping Scheme for OFDMA Downlinks in IEEE 802.16 Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I39P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045971S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411730,"authors":[{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281394100"},{"name":"Yiyan Wu","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yiyan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281231400"},{"name":"Paul Ho","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Ho","id":"37276782300"},{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292236100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411730","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"abstract":"A new cross-layer signaling interface using overlay watermarks for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is proposed in this paper. The major advantage of the new proposal is the multiple functionalities the overlay watermark provides, which includes a cross-layer signaling interface, a transceiver identification for position-aware cross-layer design, as well as its basic role as a training sequence for channel estimation. Location information of a mobile can be easily derived for efficient routing when a unique watermark is associated with each individual mobile transceiver. In addition, a new data pipe can be created by modulating the overlay watermarks for the transmission of cross-layer signaling and other interlayer interactive information. We also study the channel estimation and watermark removal techniques at the physical layer for the proposed overlay OFDM. Our channel estimator iteratively estimates the channel impulse response and the combined signal vector from the overlay OFDM signal. Cross-layer design that leads to low power consumption and more efficient routing are investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411730.pdf","startPage":"4312","endPage":"4316","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Signaling and Interface Design for OFDM Systems Using Overlay Watermarks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Watermarking","Transceivers","Cross layer design","Channel estimation","Routing","Proposals","Signal processing","OFDM modulation","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","transceivers","transient response","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interface design","OFDM systems","overlay watermarks","cross-layer signaling interface","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transceiver identification","position-aware cross-layer design","training sequence","channel estimation","mobile transceiver","interlayer interactive information","watermark removal","channel estimator","channel impulse response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Signaling and Interface Design for OFDM Systems Using Overlay Watermarks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411730/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823930","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Signaling and Interface Design for OFDM Systems Using Overlay Watermarks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I39P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089102S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411733,"authors":[{"name":"Salama Ikki","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"firstName":"Salama","lastName":"Ikki","id":"38262743800"},{"name":"Mohamed H.

We derive a closed-form expression for the error rate and analyze its dependence on the channel parameters. In DF cooperative diversity, a relay detects the received signal and then relays the signal to the destination. The destination combines the two signals received from the source and relay. We assume here that the relay decides independently (based on the received signal quality at the relay) whether or not to forward the signal to the destination. Computer simulations are used to validate our analytical results. Results show the significant performance improvement due to the use of the DF cooperative diversity.

For complex Gaussian matrix channels, the asymptotic sum rate of the proposed system is analyzed under a large antenna assumption for isotropic inputs and compared to conventional block diagonalization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink MIMO Block Diagonalization in the Presence of Other-Cell Interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411738.pdf","startPage":"4354","endPage":"4358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Downlink MIMO Block Diagonalization in the Presence of Other-Cell Interference","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411738/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823938","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink MIMO Block Diagonalization in the Presence of Other-Cell Interference","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I41P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090849S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411739,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Dietl","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Dietl","id":"37266546100"},{"name":"Gerhard Bauch","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Bauch","id":"37266555700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411739","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":474},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Feedback","MIMO","Base stations","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Feeds","Processor scheduling","Broadcasting","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","linear codes","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoding","feedback multiuser MIMO system","multiple-input multiple-output system","channel capacity","channel state information","perfect CSI","channel codebook"]}],"abstract":"The downlink of a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiuser</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiple-input</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiple-</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">output</i>\n system is considered.

The selected subset of antennas can achieve the diversity of a full system and a significant portion of the full capacity. In this paper, a new interpretation of the multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) capacity formula is derived in term of mean square error (MSE) of different detection stages for V-BLAST specifically. Performance based and capacity based antenna selection schemes are compared in terms of computational complexity as well as their optimality in minimizing the system error probability. In addition, a hybrid scheme is proposed to combine the strength of both performance based and capacity based approaches. Simulation results show that performance based selection has the best performance yet with a higher complexity than the other two schemes for most combinations of antennas. The hybrid scheme, which has the least complexity among all the three schemes has a slightly worse block error rate (BLER) than the performance based selection, but better than the capacity based scheme. Robustness of selection schemes under channel estimation errors is investigated and verified via computer simulations.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411740.pdf","startPage":"4365","endPage":"4369","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.830","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.830","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411740","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Radio frequency","Hardware","Costs","Energy consumption","MIMO","Mean square error methods","Capacity planning","Computational complexity","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","error statistics","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid receive antenna selection","V-BLAST","multiple antenna systems","radiofrequency chains","multiple-input multiple-output capacity","mean square error","computational complexity","error probability","block error rate","channel estimation errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411740/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Receive Antenna Selection Scheme for V-BLAST","accessionNumber":"9823940","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411740/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Receive Antenna Selection Scheme for V-BLAST","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I41P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072157S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411741,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37292761600"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohtsuki","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohtsuki","id":"37268988400"},{"name":"Toshinobu Kaneko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinobu","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37287486400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411741","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Bit error rate","Signal detection","Maximum likelihood detection","Rician channels","Euclidean distance","Wireless LAN","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Channel state information","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoding","MIMO system","line-of-sight environment","signal detection","multiple-input multiple-output system","maximum likelihood detection","minimum Euclidean distance","eigenvalue","channel matrix","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"In line-of-sight (LOS) environments, the signal detection of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems becomes difficult because the correlation among channels becomes higher when the phase differences of direct paths are close to each other.

Suppose that, at any instant in time, part of the users serve as sources while the others serve as relays. The proposed MUD scheme decorrelates the sources' messages at the destination with the help of precoding at the relays. Three cooperation methods are considered: (1) transmit beamforming, (2) selective relaying and (3) distributed space- time coding. The optimal weighting factors of each method are determined by taking the quality of the source-to-relay and/or the relay-to-destination links into account. We show that significant improvements in terms of the spatial diversity and multiple-access interference (MAI) mitigation can be attained when precoding is employed at the relays to aid the decorrelation at the destination. The advantages are even more pronounced when selective relaying is combined with the other two schemes.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.836","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411746.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"4397","endPage":"4401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relay with Multi-User Detection in Uplink CDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relay with Multi-User Detection in Uplink CDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411746/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823946","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411746/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relay with Multi-User Detection in Uplink CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I42P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05446S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411748,"authors":[{"name":"Seungho Song","affiliation":["Access Network R&D Center, SK Telecom, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungho","lastName":"Song","id":"37711049800"},{"name":"Kyuho Son","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyuho","lastName":"Son","id":"37268350900"},{"name":"Hyang-Won Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyang-Won","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280127700"},{"name":"Song Chong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Chong","id":"37276102200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411748","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"abstract":"In this paper, we study how the cooperative relaying can improve both capacity and fairness in cellular network. The capacity and fairness have a trade-off relationship, so increasing cell throughput deteriorates fairness and vice versa. First, we show that the achievable average throughput region can be enlarged by using the cooperative relaying. This enlarged region means that capacity and fairness can be improved at the same time with an adequate scheduling algorithm. Thus, secondly we propose a generalized scheduling algorithm for cooperative relaying. The proposed scheduling algorithm can improve both capacity and fairness at the expense of cooperation among users. From simulations, we show that the trade-off relationship can be surpassed and the unfairness problem in the heterogeneous channel condition can be solved by the opportunistic relaying.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411748.pdf","startPage":"4407","endPage":"4412","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Relaying in Cellular Network for Capacity and Fairness Improvement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Scheduling algorithm","Throughput","Base stations","Research and development","Telecommunications","Computer science","Electronic mail","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic relaying","cellular network","trade-off relationship","cell throughput","adequate scheduling algorithm","generalized scheduling algorithm","heterogeneous channel condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Relaying in Cellular Network for Capacity and Fairness Improvement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411748/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823948","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Relaying in Cellular Network for Capacity and Fairness Improvement","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I42P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051858S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4411748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411749,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

Most of the existing cooperation-based routing algorithms are implemented by finding a shortest-path route first. As such, these routing algorithms do not fully exploit the merits of cooperative communications at the physical layer. In this paper, we propose a cooperation-based routing algorithm, namely, minimum power cooperative routing (MPCR) algorithm, which makes full use of the cooperative communications while constructing the minimum-power route. The MPCR algorithm constructs the minimum-power route as a cascade of the minimum-power single-relay building blocks from the source to the destination. Hence, any distributed shortest-path algorithm can be utilized to find the optimal route with polynomial complexity, while guaranteeing certain throughput. We show that the MPCR algorithm can achieve power saving of 57.36% compared to the conventional shortest-path routing algorithms. Furthermore, the MPCR algorithm can achieve power saving of 37.64% compared to the existing cooperative routing algorithms, in which the selected routes are constructed based on the noncooperative routes.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411749.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.839","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"4413","endPage":"4418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Energy-Efficient Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Energy-Efficient Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411749/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411749/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823949","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Energy-Efficient Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I42P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140706S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411750,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed technique applies a partial pre-decorrelation to the users in contrast to the full orthogonalisation performed in conventional precoding. When the appropriate criteria are employed for the selection of the users to be decorrelated, an improved signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is obtained without the need for additional power-per-user investment. Performance enhancement is attained for a variety of communication scenarios, but the focus of this paper is on unequal power users systems and the resistance to the near-far effect.

SMSE signals are constructed within an architecture governed by cognitive radio (CR) principles and supported by software defined radio (SDR) implementation, a union referred to as CR- based SDR. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, a foundational part of future 4G systems, are collectively classified as SMSE because data modulation and encoding are applied in the spectral domain. Framework applicability was demonstrated for realistic 4G signals by illustrating consistency between resultant analytic SMSE expressions and published results. Framework implementability and flexibility is further demonstrated herein using more complex CDMA signal structures. Modeling and simulation results are presented for a form of multi-carrier CDMA using polyphase codes with adaptive spectral notching (interference avoidance). Collectively, the SMSE implementation of this system correlates very well with theoretical predictions for multiple access scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411751.pdf","startPage":"4424","endPage":"4428","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SMSE Implementation of CDMA with Partial Band Interference Suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference suppression","Modulation coding","Computer architecture","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Software radio","OFDM modulation","Encoding","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","code division multiple access","codes","cognitive radio","interference suppression","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial band interference suppression","spectrally modulated spectrally encoded framework","code division multiple access","cognitive radio","software defined radio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","4G systems","data modulation","data encoding","spectral domain","polyphase codes","adaptive spectral notching","interference avoidance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An SMSE Implementation of CDMA with Partial Band Interference Suppression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823951","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SMSE Implementation of CDMA with Partial Band Interference Suppression","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I43P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068907S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411752,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqi Wang","affiliation":["Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"firstName":"Tianqi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536306900"},{"name":"Cheng Li","affiliation":["Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37335382400"},{"name":"Hsiao-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Hwa","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281172400"},{"name":"Mohsen Guizani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Western Michigan University, USA"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Guizani","id":"37273043000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411752","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Doppler shift","RAKE receivers","Multipath channels","Frequency estimation","Councils","Computer science","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Doppler shift","optimisation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain","Doppler diversity","adaptive Doppler shift estimation","DS-CDMA systems","basis expansion model","expectation maximization","Doppler shifts","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an algorithm for frequency domain adaptive Doppler shift estimation in the presence of multiple Doppler subpaths in DS-CDMA systems.

However, no orthogonal spreading code has been proposed to efficiently avoid multiple-access interference (MAI). In this paper, we propose a novel orthogonal spreading code for SE-CDMA. We study undesirable channel conditions under which the orthogonality property of the code could be lost. We propose a chip normalizing scheme (CNS) to restore the orthogonality property of the code in these cases. Our simulation results show that the encoded system can achieve the performance of interference-free channels. Furthermore, using our CNS the users can achieve a higher bit rate at the same bit error rate as the unnormalized case.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.843","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411753.pdf","startPage":"4434","endPage":"4439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Code Design for Spectrally Encoded CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411753/","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Code Design for Spectrally Encoded CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823953","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411753/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Code Design for Spectrally Encoded CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I43P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057696S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411763,"authors":[{"name":"Hanbyul Seo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering #029, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hanbyul","lastName":"Seo","id":"37593688900"},{"name":"Seoshin Kwack","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering #029, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seoshin","lastName":"Kwack","id":"37837197600"},{"name":"Byeong Gi Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering #029, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeong Gi","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281113300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411763","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unicast","OFDM","Throughput","Multicast algorithms","Channel capacity","Channel coding","Bandwidth","Downlink","Decoding","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","channel coding","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel structuring","efficient multicast services","unicast services integration","wireless OFDM systems","worst channel condition","channel structure","multicast traffic","unicast traffic","multicast channel capacity","channel coding","transmission rate requirement","multicast users","fitness-based subchannel allocation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we discuss how to find the optimal method for efficient integration of multicast and unicast service in wireless OFDM systems. The multicast capacity is limited by the user with the worst channel condition. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose channel structure for the multicast and unicast traffic. The multicast channel first encodes the multicast traffic and then demultiplexes it into the constituent subchannels, and the channel structure increases the multicast channel capacity with the help of the channel coding. Based on the channel structure, we develop the subchannel allocation that maximizes the total unicast throughput while guaranteeing the transmission rate requirement on the multicast traffic for all the multicast users. Since it is too complicated to solve the allocation problem directly, we devise a fitness metric that quantitatively measures how suitable the subchannel is for carrying the multicast traffic and present the fitness-based subchannel allocation (FSA) algorithm. Numerical results reveal that the FSA algorithm achieves almost the same performance as the performance upper bound in terms of average unicast throughput.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.853","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411763.pdf","startPage":"4488","endPage":"4493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Structuring and Subchannel Allocation for Efficient Multicast and Unicast Services Integration in Wireless OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411763/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Structuring and Subchannel Allocation for Efficient Multicast and Unicast Services Integration in Wireless OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823963","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411763/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Structuring and Subchannel Allocation for Efficient Multicast and Unicast Services Integration in Wireless OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I44P08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057066S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411765,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Bavarian","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Bavarian","id":"37296051800"},{"name":"James K.

Using local message passing algorithms based on belief propagation (BP) has been shown to be very promising for distributed base station processing. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of the BP algorithm grows exponentially with the number of interfering users at each base station. Reducing the computational load of marginalizing the a posteriori probabilities (APP) in BP nodes is challenging because this problem is generally rank deficient, and most well-known sub-optimal detection methods are not efficient in such conditions. In this paper we use an iterative group-wise multiuser detection algorithm to efficiently reduce the complexity of BP receiver. We evaluate the performance and complexity of the proposed RCBP algorithm under decomposed and clustered base station scenarios via simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.855","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411765.pdf","startPage":"4500","endPage":"4504","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Complexity Distributed Base Station Processing in the Uplink of Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Complexity Distributed Base Station Processing in the Uplink of Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411765/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823965","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Complexity Distributed Base Station Processing in the Uplink of Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I44P10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054454S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411766,"authors":[{"name":"Qianling Cao","affiliation":["Charles L.

It is expected that systems with high robustness will be required for MIMO in demanding industrial applications. A measurement campaign employing dual-polarized 8times8 patch arrays at 2.4 and 5.2 GHz is analyzed, where measurements were performed in two very distinct indoor scenarios: an office building and an industrial environment. For both environments the performance of three 4times4 subsystems (dual-polarized, vertical- polarized and horizontal-polarized) are compared in terms of the average capacities attained by these systems and their eigenvalue distributions. Average capacities are found to be only marginally different, indicating little advantage of dual-polarized elements for average performance. However, an eigenvalue analysis indicates that the dual-polarized system is most robust for full-rank MIMO communications, by providing orthogonal channels with more equal gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411769.pdf","startPage":"4522","endPage":"4526","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and Robustness of Single- and Dual-Polarized MIMO Systems in Office and Industrial Indoor Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","MIMO","Indoor environments","Antenna measurements","Antennas and propagation","Transmitters","Africa","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Broadband antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","MIMO systems","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-polarization antennas","MIMO systems","MIMO communications","multiple-input multiple-output systems","office indoor environments","industrial indoor environments","eigenvalue analysis","orthogonal channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Robustness of Single- and Dual-Polarized MIMO Systems in Office and Industrial Indoor Environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823969","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Robustness of Single- and Dual-Polarized MIMO Systems in Office and Industrial Indoor Environments","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I45P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051364S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411770,"authors":[{"name":"Rocco Dragone","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rocco","lastName":"Dragone","id":"37828040500"},{"name":"John Kountouriotis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Kountouriotis","id":"37395716300"},{"name":"Prathaban Mookiah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Prathaban","lastName":"Mookiah","id":"37394266600"},{"name":"Kapil R.

The goal is to create a simulation using a real world environment and taking into account realistic antenna effects. The effects of the wireless channel are examined on a per subcarrier basis. Analysis of the simulation results shows that the channel response and subsequently, mutual information is highly dependent on subcarrier. Furthermore, our analysis shows that by taking advantage of channel knowledge, a great increase in mutual information can be obtained. This leads to the conclusion that adaptive modulation has the potential to offer significant increase in system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.860","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411770.pdf","startPage":"4527","endPage":"4531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling MIMO-UWB OFDM systems with Computational Electromagnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411770/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling MIMO-UWB OFDM systems with Computational Electromagnetics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823970","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411770/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling MIMO-UWB OFDM systems with Computational Electromagnetics","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I45P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037394S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411771,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Seyedi","affiliation":["Philips Research North America, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Seyedi","id":"37266658700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411771","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Directive antennas","Directional antennas","Channel capacity","Frequency","Statistics","Communication industry","Communication standards","Physical layer","North America"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","channel capacity","directive antennas","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband channels","channel capacity","antenna directionality","short range communication systems","path loss","power gain","directional antennas","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Currently the 60 GHz band is being considered as the most attractive option for the design of very high rate (multi Gbps) short range communication systems.

A new theoretical expression of a is established for the large response in time domain of the pulse shaping filter: A pronounced increase of a with pulse shaping filter length is clearly established. For frequency selective invariant channels, the simulation results are in perfect concordance with the theoretical results.

Based on this more realistic signal propagation model, an optimal semi-Markov decision process (SMDP)-based CAC policy is proposed, which is then evaluated and compared with single antenna systems.

However, the signal associated to collisions has important information concerning the packets involved. In fact, with proper retransmissions we can efficiently resolve collisions. In this paper we propose a frequency-domain multi- packet detection technique for SC-FDE schemes (Single- Carrier with Frequency-Domain Equalization) that allows an efficient packet separation in the presence of successive collisions. This technique allows high throughputs, since the total number of transmissions is equal to the number of packets involved in the collision, even when the channel remains fixed for the retransmissions. Since we consider SC-FDE schemes and the complexity is concentrated in the receiver, this technique particularly appealing for the uplink of broadband wireless systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411787.pdf","startPage":"4619","endPage":"4624","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Multipacket Detection: A High Throughput Technique for SC-FDE Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Signal resolution","Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols","System performance","Silicon carbide","Interference cancellation","System recovery","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","broadband networks","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain multipacket detection","high throughput technique","SC-FDE system","single-carrier with frequency-domain equalization","broadband wireless system","MAC protocol","wireless channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Multipacket Detection: A High Throughput Technique for SC-FDE Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411787/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823986","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Multipacket Detection: A High Throughput Technique for SC-FDE Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"I46P11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054002S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411788,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["Department of Elect. and Computer Engg, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","id":"37296968900"},{"name":"Ekram Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Elect. and Computer Engg, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Ekram","lastName":"Hossain","id":"38514511000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411788","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Pricing","Quality of service","Nash equilibrium","Oligopoly","Iterative algorithms","Stability","Frequency","Degradation","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","iterative methods","oligopoly","pricing","quality of service","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal price competition","dynamic spectrum sharing","cognitive radio networks","oligopoly market","quality of service degradation","Bertrand game model","spectrum substitutability","channel quality","Nash equilibrium","distributed iterative game algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.878","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411788.pdf","startPage":"4625","endPage":"4629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Price Competition for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio: A Dynamic Game-Theoretic Approach","abstract":"Optimal pricing for dynamic spectrum sharing in \"cognitive radio\" networks is an open research issue. In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum pricing in a cognitive radio environment in which multiple primary services with spectrum opportunity compete with each other to offer spectrum access to the secondary services. By using an optimal pricing scheme, each of the primary services aims to maximize its profit under quality of service (QoS) constraint. We formulate this situation as an oligopoly market consisting of a few firms and a consumer. For a primary service/user, the QoS degradation is considered as the cost incurred for offering spectrum access to the secondary service/user. For the secondary service, we adopt a utility function to obtain the demand function.

If no channel is available for a secondary call, the call waits in a buffer until either a channel becomes available or a maximum waiting time is reached.

Specifically, the CR technology will allow a group of potential users (referred to as secondary users) to access available spectrum resources unused by primary users (PUs) for whom the band has been licensed. The spectrum available for secondary users (SUs) depends on PUs' activity in the licensed spectrum. In this paper, we develop a queuing analytic framework to study important performance measures experienced by SUs in a CR network. We study queuing delay and buffer statistics of SUs' packets by modeling PUs' activity as a two state Markov chain and SUs' channel quality variation as a finite state Markov chain (FSMC). In order to allocate available channels among the SUs, an opportunistic channel allocation scheme is considered. The proposed framework facilitates to design an admission controller for SUs' network in order to maintain a given quality service (QoS) requirement which is specified in the form of statistical delay guarantee.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"4647","endPage":"4652","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411792.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Queueing Analytic Model and Admission Controller Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411792/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Queueing Analytic Model and Admission Controller Design","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823991","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Queueing Analytic Model and Admission Controller Design","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J01P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070656S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411816,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-He Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-He","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37833075300"},{"name":"Wanjiun Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wanjiun","lastName":"Liao","id":"37273521700"},{"name":"Tehuang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tehuang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539596000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411816","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Channel allocation","WiMAX","Wireless networks","Bandwidth","Frequency","Broadcasting","Feedback","Traffic control","Aggregates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","radio links","telecommunication traffic","time division multiplexing","WiMax","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive downlink-uplink bandwidth allocation","IEEE 802.16","WiMAX","wireless networks","cross-layer approach","time division duplex","WiMAX channels","traffic profile","ns-2 simulations"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study adaptive bandwidth allocation for uplink and downlink channels in time division duplex (TDD)-based IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) wireless networks. In a TDD system, uplink and downlink transmissions share the same frequency at different time intervals. The TDD framing can be adaptive in the sense that the downlink to uplink bandwidth ratio can vary with time. For WiMAX channels, we consider the impact of improper bandwidth ratio on the performance of TCP and propose an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme (ABAS) which adjusts the bandwidth ratio according to the current traffic profile. Our scheme also cooperates with the scheduler to throttle the TCP source when acknowledgements are infrequent. The performance of our mechanism is validated via ns-2 simulations. The results show that our scheme outperforms static allocation in terms of higher aggregate throughput.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.906","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"4775","endPage":"4779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Downlink/Uplink Bandwidth Allocation in IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Downlink/Uplink Bandwidth Allocation in IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411816/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824014","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411816/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Downlink/Uplink Bandwidth Allocation in IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Approach","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J05P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053051S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4411817,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Tarhini","affiliation":["GET/Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications/UMR CNRS 5157, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Tarhini","id":"37658726400"},{"name":"Tijani Chahed","affiliation":["GET/Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications/UMR CNRS 5157, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Tijani","lastName":"Chahed","id":"37280007900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411817","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","WiMAX","Modulation coding","Physical layer","Bit rate","Resource management","Streaming media","Interference","Base stations","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","quality of service","telecommunication traffic","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AMC-aware QoS","adaptive modulation-and-coding","OFDMA-based IEEE802.16","base station","dynamic user configuration","multicell environment","frequency reuse schemes","streaming flows","elastic traffic"]}],"abstract":"OFDMA-based IEEE802.16 implements Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) which results in a different bit rate for each user depending on its position in the cell as well as the radio condition it experiences; users away from the base station experience lower throughput.

And this in multi-cell environment and for different frequency reuse schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMC-Aware QoS Proposal for OFDMA-Based IEEE802.16 WiMAX Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411817.pdf","startPage":"4780","endPage":"4784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"AMC-Aware QoS Proposal for OFDMA-Based IEEE802.16 WiMAX Systems","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411817/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AMC-Aware QoS Proposal for OFDMA-Based IEEE802.16 WiMAX Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J05P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052932S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411818,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Song","id":"37288980200"},{"name":"Weihua Zhuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37283383600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411818","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless LAN","Traffic control","Delay","Communication system traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Quality of service","Streaming media","Cellular networks","Admission control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","cellular-WLAN interworking","conversational services","streaming services","interactive services","multi-service support","cellular network","wireless local area networks","traffic characteristics","bursty video streams","elastic data traffic","admission control","service-differentiated session assignment","session migration","vertical handoff"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411818","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.908","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","abstract":"Multi-service support is an important motivation for interworking between the cellular network and wireless local area networks (WLANs).

As it is difficult to place the MNs in a regular pattern in the real deployment, finding the optimal locations in the deployment environment is of much interest for the service providers. For a given possible locations for the MNs and the user density in the deployment environment, we aim to find the locations of the MNs to be used that maximizes the coverage and the connectivity of the network together. Due to high computational complexity of the exhaustive searching algorithm, an efficient local searching algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that, the local search algorithm can give close to optimal performance with much lower time complexity than exhaustive searching.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.915","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"4823","endPage":"4827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411825.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless mesh networks","Area measurement","Phase measurement","Buildings","Architecture","Telecommunication traffic","Internet","Spread spectrum communication","Signal processing","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","radio networks","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["node placement algorithm","two-tier wireless mesh networks","service providers","deployment environment","computational complexity","exhaustive searching algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Node Placement Algorithm for Deployment of Two-Tier Wireless Mesh Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411825/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411825/","accessionNumber":"9824023","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node Placement Algorithm for Deployment of Two-Tier Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J07P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045817S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4411830,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["Department of Elect. and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","id":"37296968900"},{"name":"Ekram Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Elect. and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Ekram","lastName":"Hossain","id":"38514511000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411830","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Cognitive radio","Radio control","Frequency","Costs","Degradation","Feedback control","Transfer functions","Control theory","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","control theory","pricing","quality of service","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disequilibrium pricing","spectrum trading","control-theoretic approach","dynamic spectrum sharing","cognitive radio networks","QoS performance degradation","stability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equilibrium and Disequilibrium Pricing for Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio: A Control-Theoretic Approach","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","endPage":"4856","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.920","startPage":"4852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411830","abstract":"Spectrum trading is a concept used to describe the economics of dynamic spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum trading between primary and secondary services. Multiple markets are established in this trading for the multiple available frequency bands. The primary service is considered as the seller and the secondary service is considered as a buyer in a dynamic spectrum trading market. The spectrum supply from the primary service is derived based on the revenue earned due to spectrum sharing and the cost due to QoS performance degradation of the connections served by the primary service. The spectrum demand of secondary service is obtained based on the utility from spectrum usage. We first obtain the equilibrium pricing which is the point where spectrum supply equals spectrum demand. Then, we consider the case where the spectrum sellers do not offer the equilibrium price. The impact of this disequilibrium pricing is investigated. We model the cases of equilibrium and disequilibrium pricing as feedback control systems in which the spectrum seller and buyer have their own transfer functions. By using classical control theory the stability of the model is analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9824028","htmlLink":"/document/4411830/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Equilibrium and Disequilibrium Pricing for Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio: A Control-Theoretic Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equilibrium and Disequilibrium Pricing for Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio: A Control-Theoretic Approach","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J08P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037609S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411831,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Su","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Su","id":"37280809500"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411831","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks","Access protocols","Transceivers","Scheduling algorithm","Radiofrequency identification","Frequency","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","multi-channel MAC protocols","wireless ad hoc networks","multi-channel medium access control","spectrum sensing","packet scheduling","unused frequency spectrum","transceivers","dedicated control channel","collaboratively channel-sensing policies"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411831","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.921","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","abstract":"We propose the cognitive-radio-based multi-channel medium access control (MAC) protocols, which integrate the spectrum sensing and packet scheduling, for the wireless ad hoc networks.

Under our proposed protocols, each secondary user is equipped with two transceivers. One of the transceivers operates on a dedicated control channel, while the other is used as a cognitive radio that can periodically sense and dynamically utilize the identified unused channels. To obtain the channel status accurately, we propose two types of collaboratively channel- sensing policies, namely random sensing policy and negotiation- based sensing policy, to help the MAC protocols detect the unused channels. We also develop the analytical models to study the proposed MAC protocols with the two types of channel-sensing policies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"4857","endPage":"4861","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411831.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Based Multi-Channel MAC Protocols for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411831/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Based Multi-Channel MAC Protocols for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824029","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Based Multi-Channel MAC Protocols for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J08P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048244S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4411832,"authors":[{"name":"Senhua Huang","affiliation":["University of California,\uc2a0Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Senhua","lastName":"Huang","id":"37309545500"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["University of California,\uc2a0Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278651400"},{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["University of California,\uc2a0Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292951300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411832","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Radio transmitters","Interference","Array signal processing","Transmitting antennas","Receivers","Chromium","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","cognitive radio","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonintrusive cognitive radio networks","smart antenna technology","spectrum scarcity","temporal spectral efficiency","transmit beamforming","primary users","cognitive users","antenna array","primary receiver","primary transmitters","transmission probability","wireless communication networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Intrusive Cognitive Radio Networks Based on Smart Antenna Technology","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","endPage":"4867","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.922","startPage":"4862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411832","abstract":"Cognitive radio has recently been identified as a potential relief to spectrum scarcity by improving temporal spectral efficiency.

These impairments are relevant when the very high speed of a mobile receiver forces to use a non-directional antenna. First, we compare low-complexity time-domain and frequency-domain block equalizers. Then, we propose a novel frequency-domain equalizer based on a fast Fourier transform (FFT) with size higher than the length of the processed block. Thanks to the increased frequency resolution, the proposed equalizer yields improved performance with respect to the conventional frequency-domain equalizer. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.952","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411862.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","startPage":"5021","endPage":"5025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Equalization for Single-Carrier Satellite Communications with High-Mobility Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block Equalization for Single-Carrier Satellite Communications with High-Mobility Receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411862/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824059","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4411862/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Equalization for Single-Carrier Satellite Communications with High-Mobility Receivers","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J13P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049054S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4411880,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Loiacono","affiliation":["Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Loiacono","id":"37428578300"},{"name":"Justinian Rosca","affiliation":["Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Justinian","lastName":"Rosca","id":"37284969400"},{"name":"Wade Trappe","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB), Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Wade","lastName":"Trappe","id":"37266719100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411880","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":136},"abstract":"Current rate adaptation schemes for 802.11 exhibit sudden and severe drops in throughput in real application scenarios. Although there have been several propositions to remedy such rate adaptation failures, there has not been a thorough analysis of the causes that lead to such a \"snowball effect.\" This paper provides an analysis of the factors that lead to the poor performance of current rate adaptation schemes in real environments. We show that current rate adaptation schemes fail because they do not differentiate between poor channel conditions and collisions as the source of transmission failures, and consequently invoke improper responses that cascade to dramatic throughput degradation. We support the analysis through experimentation with real data from a wireless video surveillance application, and provide recommendations for the next generation of WiFi rate control schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411880.pdf","startPage":"5117","endPage":"5122","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Snowball Effect: Detailing Performance Anomalies of 802.11 Rate Adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Laboratories","Cause effect analysis","Video surveillance","Physical layer","Analytical models","Spirals","Educational institutions","Failure analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network reliability","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["snowball effect","802.11 rate adaptation","rate adaptation failures","channel conditions","transmission failures source","wireless video surveillance application","WiFi"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Snowball Effect: Detailing Performance Anomalies of 802.11 Rate Adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411880/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824077","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Snowball Effect: Detailing Performance Anomalies of 802.11 Rate Adaptation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J16P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077992S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4411891,"authors":[{"name":"Shouhong Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Shouhong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37337369300"},{"name":"Kin K.

Further, we propose three approaches to calculate the amplifying parameters at relays. Simulation studies show that for given data forwarding scenario if the relay number satisfies the least requested number, all three approaches can realize orthogonal MIMO-relaying or that via own component suppression. With the least requested number of relays, all three approaches exhibit the same diversity order (one), and that the seemingly best approach with channel-matched weights is worse than the other two approaches, i.e. the one with channel phase-matched weights and the one with all-equal weights.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411891.pdf","startPage":"5175","endPage":"5179","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Orthogonal MIMO-Relaying for UWB Ad-Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Relays","MIMO","Frequency conversion","Pulse modulation","Data engineering","Educational institutions","Routing","Interference","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","antenna arrays","MIMO communication","relays","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative orthogonal MIMO-relaying","UWB ad-hoc networks","multiple input multiple output","ultra wide band","channels information","amplify-and-forward data relaying policy","component suppression","channel phase-matched weights"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Orthogonal MIMO-Relaying for UWB Ad-Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411891/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824087","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Orthogonal MIMO-Relaying for UWB Ad-Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J18P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137119S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4411895,"authors":[{"name":"Song Xinghua","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Xinghua","id":"37689756900"},{"name":"He Zhiqiang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Zhiqiang","id":"38553712400"},{"name":"Niu Kai","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Niu","lastName":"Kai","id":"37285594800"},{"name":"Wu Weiling","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Weiling","id":"37266423000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411895","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"abstract":"In this paper, a fair and simple resource allocation scheme is proposed for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access distributed wireless communication systems (OFDMA-DWCS). Instead of finding global optimal solution, we hierarchically decouple the subcarrier and power allocation problem into two subproblems. A distributed scheduling is employed on two levels: access-point-level (AP-level) and user-level. In AP-level scheduling, the subcarriers are roughly allocated by the central unit (CU) to different APs. In user-level scheduling, a further subcarrier and power allocation is performed by each AP for its underlying users. We adopt Nash bargain solution fairness criterion in our scheme, which ensures a good tradeoff between fairness and efficiency on both the AP-level and the user-level. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed scheme can achieve comparable overall system rate to that of centralized algorithms with much reduced complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411895.pdf","startPage":"5195","endPage":"5199","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Resource Allocation for OFDMA Distributed Wireless Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless communication","Radio spectrum management","Signal processing algorithms","Processor scheduling","Optical fiber cables","Optical fiber communication","Downlink","Quality of service","NIST"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","resource allocation","scheduling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical resource allocation","OFDMA","distributed wireless communication systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access","distributed scheduling","access-point-level scheduling","user-level scheduling","Nash bargain solution fairness criterion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical Resource Allocation for OFDMA Distributed Wireless Communication Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824091","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical Resource Allocation for OFDMA Distributed Wireless Communication Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J19P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050009S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411896,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Mehbodniya","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Mehbodniya","id":"37419363800"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411896","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"abstract":"Ultra wideband (UWB) technology is one of the promising solutions for future short-range communication which has recently been receiving increasing attention by many researchers. So far, two standards have been proposed to the IEEE 802.15.3a task group (TG3a) as high-speed physical technologies for next-generation wireless personal area networks (WPAN). These standards are based on multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB or direct-sequence (DS) UWB, two different technologies that will have to coexist in the near future. In this paper, we provide a performance analysis of MB-OFDM UWB communication in the presence of binarv phase-shift keying time-hopping (BPSK-TH) UWB or BPSK-DS UWB interfering transmissions. In the bit error rate (BER) analysis, it is considered that there are multiple UWB interferers affecting the MB-OFDM signal. A Gaussian approximation is considered for the DS-UWB and TH-UWB interferers under consideration and used in the analysis of the BER performance of a MB-OFDM UWB system. Furthermore, a waveforming technique is suggested for mitigating the effect of interference and its efficiency is illustrated in terms of BER improvement. Numerical and simulation results are provided and compared for different coexistence scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411896.pdf","startPage":"5200","endPage":"5204","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence Between DS-UWB and MB-OFDM: Analysis and Interference Mitigation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Bit error rate","Performance analysis","Ultra wideband technology","Next generation networking","Wireless personal area networks","OFDM","Ultra wideband communication","Phase shift keying","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Gaussian processes","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","personal area networks","phase shift keying","spread spectrum communication","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MB-OFDM","interference mitigation","ultra wideband technology","short-range communication","high-speed physical technologies","next-generation wireless personal area networks","WPAN","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","performance analysis","phase-shift keying time-hopping UWB","bit error rate analysis","UWB interference","Gaussian approximation","BER performance","waveforming technique","BER improvement","direct-sequence UWB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Coexistence Between DS-UWB and MB-OFDM: Analysis and Interference Mitigation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824092","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistence Between DS-UWB and MB-OFDM: Analysis and Interference Mitigation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J19P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056291S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4411897,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jun Kim","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Seung-Jun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309957000"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375000"},{"name":"Mohammad Madihian","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Madihian","id":"37298760800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411897","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Spread spectrum communication","Relays","National electric code","Laboratories","Throughput","Routing","Physical layer","OFDM","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","multihop wireless backhaul networks","OFDMA","cooperative relaying","cross-layer optimization","PHY-MAC constraints","mutual interference","half-duplex operation"]}],"abstract":"An optimal resource allocation strategy for OFDMA multi-hop wireless backhaul networks is considered.

The algorithms show a significant improvement of the system performance compared with the static case, i.e., no adaptive modulation; in particular each algorithm is suited for satisfying different QoS requirements.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.988","publicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4410909/4410910/04411898.pdf","startPage":"5210","endPage":"5214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4410910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Modulation in Wireless OFDMA Systems with Finite State Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411898/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Modulation in Wireless OFDMA Systems with Finite State Modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824094","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4411898/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Modulation in Wireless OFDMA Systems with Finite State Modeling","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"J19P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044093S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4410909","isNumber":"4410910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4410909","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4410910","articleId":"4411898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4411899,"authors":[{"name":"Ruonan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ruonan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37400585000"},{"name":"Lin Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Cai","id":"37272706500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1042-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1043-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"4411899","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Frequency domain analysis","Analytical models","Bandwidth","Intersymbol interference","Frequency division multiplexing","Frequency response","Signal to noise ratio","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","Nakagami channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet-level channel model","wireless OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading channel","level cross rate","frequency response","finite state Markov chains","multicarrier system","signal to noise ratio","upper layer protocol design","packet error behavior"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a novel packet-level channel model for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading channel.

In this study, strategies for improving the reliability of the message broadcasting from the BS to the SSs are proposed and evaluated. By using the, so called, mesh assisted broadcasting (MAB) strategies, SS may exploit the higher connectivity degree offered by the mesh network during reception and may optionally cooperate with other SSs during the retransmission. MAB strategy performance is evaluated analytically and through simulations. Due to the complexity of the computational problem, analytical models are developed only for the MAB strategies for which the probability that an SS correctly receives a broadcast message can be obtained in closed form.

This technique is derived from a constellation shaping algorithm, where the constellation points with lower average energy are selected from a larger set of points. There are multiple choices available to select the points with lower peak energy for a given sequence of data bits, and this flexibility is used to reduce the peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Subsequently, this selection algorithm, which is formulated in terms of a zero-one quadratic problem, is optimized by the semidefinite programming algorithm (SDPA). Simulation results show that the PAPR of SDPA is noticeably better than MMSE-Threshold, while the complexity of MMSE-Threshold is smaller than that of SDPA. MMSE-Threshold is compared with alternative techniques reported in the literature. We show that, while we obtain a PAPR that is similar or better than those of the compared techniques, the complexity of MMSE-Threshold is low. In addition, the MMSE-threshold method results in about 1 dB shaping gain (reduction in the average energy) with less than 1% rate loss for PAPR reduction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4459116/04411933.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2007.912060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2007.912060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4411933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Algorithm for Peak/Average Power Reduction in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Quadratic programming","Gain","Partitioning algorithms","Frequency division multiplexing","Wideband","Narrowband","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-average power reduction algorithm","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MMSE-threshold","constellation shaping algorithm","peak to average power ratio","zero-one quadratic problem","semideflnite programming algorithm","SDPA","PAPR reduction","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constellation shaping","OFDM","optimization","PAPR","semidefinite programming algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4411933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New Algorithm for Peak/Average Power Reduction in OFDM Systems","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4411933/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9897268","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Algorithm for Peak/Average Power Reduction in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"54tbc01-kohandani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090909S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4459116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4459116","articleId":"4411933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4412014,"authors":[{"name":"Fuat Kucuk","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Fuat Kucuk","id":"37087327068"},{"name":"Hiroki Goto","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Hiroki Goto","id":"37087327611"},{"name":"Hai-Jiao Guo","affiliation":["Tohoku Gakuin University, Tagajo, Japan"],"lastName":"Hai-Jiao Guo","id":"37087328297"},{"name":"Osamu Ichinokura","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Osamu Ichinokura","id":"37087328347"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-86510-07-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412014","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412014","abstract":"Switched Reluctance (SR) motors have taken remarkable role in the industry due to their rugged behavior, simple structure and low cost in mass production. An SR motor can produce large torque in a wide speed range. However, it has some drawbacks such as high torque ripple and noise. Therefore, torque ripple reduction strategy is required. Direct Torque Control (DTC) allows users to control the torque and the torque ripple. Feedback of motor torque is essential in the DTC as in most of the SR motor control techniques. The DTC conventionally employs position sensor and estimates motor torque from rotor position and current via look-up table. This paper proposes a new sensorless method for torque estimation. Principle of the proposed method is based on the determination of instantaneous phase torque from phase torque magnitude and torque sign. The phase torque magnitude is estimated by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using flux linkage and current while the torque sign is form the inductance vector angle. It is realized that waveforms of the torque magnitude and the inductance vector angle match well at zero levels. The inductance vector angle is obtained by applying \u03b1 - \u00df transformation to the phase inductances. A switch connects one of the two constant sources (-1, 1) to the output according to the inductance vector angle and defines the torque sign. Multiplication of the phase torque magnitude and the torque sign results the phase torque. Thus, the phase torque is directly estimated without position sensor.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412014","startPage":"503","endPage":"507","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4411937/4411938/04412014.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks and inductance vector based sensorless torque estimation in switched reluctance motor drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Inductance","Reluctance motors","Strontium","Torque control","Phase estimation","Switches","Costs","Mass production","Sensorless control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["switched reluctance motor","artificial neural networks","sensorless torque estimation","direct torque control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks and inductance vector based sensorless torque estimation in switched reluctance motor drive","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412014/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks and inductance vector based sensorless torque estimation in switched reluctance motor drive","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-12132007-00076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057605S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4411937","isNumber":"4411938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4411937","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4411938","articleId":"4412014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"KIEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4412072,"authors":[{"name":"Yanli Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Yanli Zhang","id":"37087552502"},{"name":"Hee Sung Yoon","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hee Sung Yoon","id":"37088075219"},{"name":"Chang Seop Koh","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang Seop Koh","id":"37087152654"},{"name":"Dexin Xie","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Dexin Xie","id":"37087398744"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-86510-07-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412072","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412072","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Electromagnetic devices","Hypercubes","Sampling methods","Response surface methodology","Design optimization","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Pareto optimization","Electromagnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design of experiments","electromagnetic devices","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic devices","Latin hypercube sampling","global optimization algorithm","adaptive response surface approximation","design-of-experiments","multiobjective Pareto optimization"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a global optimization algorithm of electromagnetic devices using an adaptive response surface approximation of the objective function with sampling strategy based on design of experiments.

Nowadays, the sintered neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) material is used in most of PM machines. This kind of PM material has large compression strength but small tensile strength, and can not withstand the large centrifugal force due to the high rotation speed. A nonmagnetic steel enclosure is needed to cover the PM material. The tensile press of PM can be reduced by pre-pressure applied to the outer surface of the PM through shrink-fitting into the enclosure. In this paper, the comprehensive optimization design of PM rotor structure is introduced with multiple constraints, such as deformation, stress and critical speed. The capacity of enclosure is the optimal goal. By finite element non-linear contact and optimization analysis, the optimized result for a high speed PM machine with rated speed of 60 000 rpm is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412077","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4411937/4411938/04412077.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412077","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization design of rotor structure for high speed permanent magnet machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimization design of rotor structure for high speed permanent magnet machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412077/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9826738","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization design of rotor structure for high speed permanent magnet machines","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-12132007-00139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068963S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4411937","isNumber":"4411938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4411937","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4411938","articleId":"4412077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"KIEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4412078,"authors":[{"name":"Gwan Soo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gwan Soo Park","id":"37086984398"},{"name":"Hyuk Won","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyuk Won","id":"37087365278"},{"name":"Dong Sok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Sok Kim","id":"37087733652"},{"name":"Jae Man Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Man Han","id":"37087733587"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-86510-07-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412078","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"abstract":"This paper described about biggest hurdle of MRAM solved method for high capacity.

It is useful for harmonics study. Secondly, the dynamic model is developed using a low-frequency chaotic signal to modulate the static electric arc voltage, the chaotic signal is generated via an asymmetric nonlinear Chua's circuit. It is useful for voltage fluctuation and flicker study. Simulation of the static model and dynamic model are performed in MATLAB. Through comparing the simulated results with the measurement data, it is shown that the model can accurately represent the static and dynamic behaviors of arc furnace.

SRM has been proposed for use in applications requiring certain fault tolerance. It is important to distinguish and characterize the inter-turn winding faults in SRM for maintenance and diagnostic purposes. In order to build an accurate model of SRM with and without faults, the effective magnetic equivalent circuit method is used to calculate the nonlinear flux-linkage characteristics under various winding fault conditions. ANN is applied for its well-known interpolation capabilities for the highly nonlinear SRM, with phase current, rotor position and a fault condition parameter as inputs and flux-linkage as output. Then, the dynamic models for the SRM with inter-turn winding faults are constructed. The analysis of the results from the faulty machine under different control strategies is presented and verifies the good performance of the developed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412298","pdfPath":"/iel5/4411937/4411938/04412298.pdf","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1605","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling inter-turn winding faults in switched reluctance machines based on neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling inter-turn winding faults in switched reluctance machines based on neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9826956","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4412298/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling inter-turn winding faults in switched reluctance machines based on neural network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-12132007-00360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072299S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4411937","isNumber":"4411938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4411937","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4411938","articleId":"4412298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"KIEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4412326,"authors":[{"name":"John W.

Based on this method, an induction machine has been developed to operate in either a 12pole-3phase or a 4pole-9phase configuration. A novel control scheme was developed to control the motor during the pole-changing transition allowing continuous torque production. During the transition the motor is controlled as two independent motors, using the same stator windings and iron core. This field orientation control based scheme requires the realization of two sets of independent current commands on the motor's nine stator windings. In addition, the two current sets have to be obtained from motor's measured stator currents. This paper presents a current transformation between two independent orthogonal reference frames and a nine-axes reference frame.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque Control During Pole-Changing Transition of a 3:1 Pole Induction Machine","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412326","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4411937/4411938/04412326.pdf","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS12746.2007.4412326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Torque Control During Pole-Changing Transition of a 3:1 Pole Induction Machine","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9826984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque Control During Pole-Changing Transition of a 3:1 Pole Induction Machine","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-12132007-00388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030102S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","isNumber":"4411938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4411937","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4412326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4412356,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsien Hsia","affiliation":["Multimedia IC Design Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hsien","lastName":"Hsia","id":"37271479000"},{"name":"Jing-Ming Guo","affiliation":["Multimedia Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jing-Ming","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277256300"},{"name":"Jen-Shiun Chiang","affiliation":["Multimedia IC Design Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Shiun","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37271474300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3058-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3058-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412356","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Delay","Discrete cosine transforms","Image coding","Scalability","Signal processing","Degradation","Image quality","MPEG 4 Standard","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2-D integer discrete wavelet transform","symmetric mask-based scheme","wavelet coding","image/video processing","signal coding","lifting-based latency"]}],"abstract":"Wavelet coding has been shown to be better than discrete cosine transform (DCT) in image/video processing. Moreover, it has the feature of scalability, which is involved in modern video standards. This work presents novel algorithms, namely 2-D symmetric mask-based discrete wavelet transform (SMDWT), to improve the critical issue of the 2-D lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LDWT), and then obtains the benefit of low latency, high-speed operation, and low temporal memory. The SMDWT also has the advantages of high-performance embedded periodic extension boundary treatment, reduced complexity, regular signal coding, short critical path, reduced latency time, and independent subband coding processing. Moreover, the 2-D lifting-based DWT performance can also be easily improved by exploiting appropriate parallel method inherently in SMDWT. Comparing with the normal 2-D 5/3 integer lifting-based DWT the proposed method significantly improves lifting-based latency and complexity in 2-D DWT without degradation in image quality. The algorithm can be applied to real-time image/video applications, such as JPEG2000, MPEG-4 still texture object decoding, and wavelet-based Scalable Video Coding (SVC).","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2007.4412356","publicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412339/4412340/04412356.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2007.4412356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412340","startPage":"57","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity Reduction and Fast Algorithm for 2-D Integer Discrete Wavelet Transform Using Symmetric Mask-Based Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Complexity Reduction and Fast Algorithm for 2-D Integer Discrete Wavelet Transform Using Symmetric Mask-Based Scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412356/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895713","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4412356/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity Reduction and Fast Algorithm for 2-D Integer Discrete Wavelet Transform Using Symmetric Mask-Based Scheme","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"30580057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061392S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412339","isNumber":"4412340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412339","xplore-issue":"4412340","articleId":"4412356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4412369,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Tao","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Wissenschaftliches Rechnen Forschungszentrum, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tao","id":"37532647200"},{"name":"Asadollah Shahbahrami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran","Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Asadollah","lastName":"Shahbahrami","id":"37398211900"},{"name":"Ben Juurlink","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Juurlink","id":"37267125200"},{"name":"Rainer Buchty","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Technische Informatik Universit\u00e4t, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Buchty","id":"37563811700"},{"name":"Wolfgang Karl","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Technische Informatik Universit\u00e4t, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Karl","id":"37341230300"},{"name":"Stamatis Vassiliadis","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stamatis","lastName":"Vassiliadis","id":"37273396800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3058-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3058-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412369","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Filtering","Cache memory","Data visualization","Runtime","Discrete transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Encoding","Transform coding","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","discrete wavelet transforms","logic design","memory architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache performance","discrete wavelet transform","horizontal filtering","vertical filtering","access behavior","cache memory","data sizes","code optimization","optimization potentials","cache visualization tool","runtime cache activities","mapping conflicts","capacity miss"]}],"abstract":"The 2D DWT consists of two 1D DWT in both directions: horizontal filtering processes the rows followed by vertical filtering processes the columns. It is well known that a straightforward implementation of the vertical filtering shows quite different performance with various working set sizes. The only reasonable explanation for this has to be the access behavior of the cache memory. As known, vertical filtering has mapping conflicts in the cache with a working set size that is power of two. However, it is not clear how this conflict forms and whether cache problems exist with other data sizes. Such knowledge is the base for efficient code optimization. In order to acquire this knowledge and to achieve more accurate optimization potentials, we apply a cache visualization tool to examine the runtime cache activities of the vertical implementation. We find that besides mapping conflicts, vertical filtering also shows a large number of capacity misses. More specifically, the visualization tool allows us to detect the parameters related to the strategies. This guarantees the feasibility of the optimization. Our initial experimental results on several different architectures show an up to 215% gain in execution time compared to an already optimized baseline implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Cache Performance of the Discrete Wavelet Transform Using a Visualization Tool","publicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2007.4412369","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412339/4412340/04412369.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2007.4412369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Cache Performance of the Discrete Wavelet Transform Using a Visualization Tool","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412369/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895726","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Cache Performance of the Discrete Wavelet Transform Using a Visualization Tool","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"30580153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084366S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412339","isNumber":"4412340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412339","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4412340","articleId":"4412369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4412408,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Ghaemi Osgouie","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Design, Robotics,  and Automation (CEDRA), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"lastName":"Kambiz Ghaemi Osgouie","id":"37087993630"},{"name":"Ali Meghdari","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Design, Robotics,  and Automation (CEDRA), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"lastName":"Ali Meghdari","id":"37087993129"},{"name":"Saeed Sohrabpour","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Design, Robotics,  and Automation (CEDRA), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"lastName":"Saeed Sohrabpour","id":"37087993098"},{"name":"Mehdi Salmani Jelodar","affiliation":["Head of Robotics Department, Sepanta Robotics and AI Research Foundation"],"lastName":"Mehdi Salmani Jelodar","id":"37087991811"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1263-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1264-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4412408","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Ellipsoids","Arm","Force measurement","Robotics and automation","Robot kinematics","Orbital robotics","Manipulator dynamics","Robotic assembly","Master-slave"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","genetic algorithms","manipulator kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","optimization","dual-arm cam-lock robot manipulator kinematics","cooperative system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412408","abstract":"Cooperative systems have been extensively investigated in literature.

The control scheme consists of two nested control loops (named inner and outer loop) and a linear strain feedback to decouple the motor and the link dynamics. The controller design is based on the passivity relationship existing between the integral of the torque measured at the base of the arm (coupling torque) and the motor angle. The inner loop controls the motor position and the outer loop keeps the stability of the overall system to large changes in the robot payload and cancels the residual vibration. The control scheme design is validated both in simulation as well as in experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4412550/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9826440","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new design methodology for passivity-based control of single- link flexible manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new design methodology for passivity-based control of single- link flexible manipulators","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12142007-00152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046575S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412397","isNumber":"4412398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412397","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4412398","articleId":"4412550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4412552,"authors":[{"name":"Luca M.

A closed loop identification is needed because the system is open loop unstable, and, moreover, because to correctly execute the identification procedure, the robot has to track an optimal reference input. Some solutions are also presented to overtake common identification problems, such as bias of the estimated parameters, outliers detection and elimination, and noise sensitivity of the estimation.

They have been very popular and widely applied for many years now due to the rapid advancements in data and communication wireless technologies. There are many challenges to be overcome in order to put such a heterogeneous system together. Key issues to be considered are network delay, data sensitivity and information security. This paper characterizes a wireless distributed NCS, a testbed called iSpace based on these key factors. We integrated static network security algorithms DES and 3DES with the NCS testbed iSpace - a multidisciplinary network based robot navigation system - and characterized it on the basis of bandwidth requirement, data classification and data sensitivity, network delay effect on the system performance. The paper demonstrates through results that a dynamic optimization is required between network security for reliability and time-sensitivity of the NCS. Future work in dynamic optimization in security is suggested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412569/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9871714","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4412569/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of data-sensitive wireless distributed networked-control-systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of data-sensitive wireless distributed networked-control-systems","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12142007-00171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045449S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412397","isNumber":"4412398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412397","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4412398","articleId":"4412569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4412579,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuming Gong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Qiuming Gong","id":"37087429706"},{"name":"Yaoyu Li","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Yaoyu Li","id":"37087382735"},{"name":"Zhong-Ren Peng","affiliation":["Department of Urban Planning, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Zhong-Ren Peng","id":"37087429579"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1263-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1264-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"4412579","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1322},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412579","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent transportation systems","Energy management","Power system management","Hybrid electric vehicles","Fuel economy","Traffic control","Power system modeling","Batteries","Management information systems","Geographic Information Systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","energy management systems","fuel economy","hybrid electric vehicles","optimal control","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power management","intelligent transportation system","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","fuel economy","emission","battery power","charge state","trip information","vehicle operation","on-board geographical information systems","GIS","global positioning systems","GPS","traffic flow modeling","driving cycle modeling","historic traffic information","dynamic programming algorithm","charge-depletion control","hybrid SUV","rule-based power management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","Power Management","Intelligent Transportation System","Dynamic Programming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AIM.2007.4412579","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412397/4412398/04412579.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ASME international conference on advanced intelligent mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ASME international conference on advanced intelligent mechatronics","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2007.4412579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power management of plug-in HEV with intelligent transportation system","abstract":"Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) have demonstrated their capability of improving the fuel economy and emission. The plug-in HEV (PHEV), utilizing more battery power, has become a more attractive upgrade of HEV. The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEV, i.e. the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the destination of the trip. In the past, the trip information has been considered as future information for vehicle operation and thus unavailable a priori. This situation can be changed by the current advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) based on the use of on-board Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, a new approach of optimal power management of PHEV in the charge-depletion mode is proposed with driving cycle modeling based on the historic traffic information. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to reinforce the charge-depletion control such that the SOC drops to a specific terminal value at the final time of the cycle. The vehicle model was based on a hybrid SUV. Only fuel consumption is considered for the current stage of study. Simulation results showed significant improvement in fuel economy compared with rule-based power management. Furthermore, simulations on several driving cycles using the proposed method showed much better consistency in fuel economy compared to the rule-based control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412579/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9871721","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412579/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal power management of plug-in HEV with intelligent transportation system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power management of plug-in HEV with intelligent transportation system","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12142007-00181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067877S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412397","isNumber":"4412398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412397","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4412398","articleId":"4412579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4412632,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However the RF performance of these devices often experiences limitation due to trapping effects and self-heating. These complicate the development of accurate large-signal models for GaN FETs. To simplify this process, a state-space modelling technique using an artificial neural network (ANN) is used in this work to model the large signal behaviour of the GaN device. In this way, the model is constructed directly from large-signal measurement data collected while the device is in an operating mode close to its application, i.e., class AB power amplifier (PA). To demonstrate the approach, a hybrid power amplifier based on GaN FETs was designed and fabricated. The good agreement between measurements and simulation results verifies the proposed approach. It is the first time that this modelling approach is used in circuit design.","doi":"10.1109/EMICC.2007.4412642","startPage":"40","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412607/4412608/04412642.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMICC.2007.4412642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaN power amplifier design based on artificial neural network modelling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Power amplifiers","Artificial neural networks","FETs","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Signal processing","Power measurement","Circuit simulation","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect transistor circuits","neural nets","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier design","artificial neural network modelling","field effect transistors","state-space modelling technique","hybrid power amplifier","GaN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"GaN power amplifier design based on artificial neural network modelling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9803310","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaN power amplifier design based on artificial neural network modelling","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-12082007-000034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108631S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412607","isNumber":"4412608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412607","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4412608","articleId":"4412642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4412644,"authors":[{"name":"Julie Mazeau","affiliation":["THALES Airborne Systems, Elancourt, France"],"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Mazeau","id":"38313024200"},{"name":"Raphael Sommet","affiliation":["XLIM, CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Sommet","id":"37285094600"},{"name":"Daniel Caban-Chastas","affiliation":["THALES Airborne Systems, Elancourt, France"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Caban-Chastas","id":"38320511700"},{"name":"Emmanuel Gatard","affiliation":["XLIM, CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Gatard","id":"37295272200"},{"name":"Raymond Quere","affiliation":["XLIM, CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Quere","id":"37282214200"},{"name":"Yves Mancuso","affiliation":["THALES Airborne Systems, Elancourt, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Mancuso","id":"37298251000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-002-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412644","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"abstract":"This paper considers a new approach for nonlinear system level models dedicated to high RF power amplifiers.

OFDM is significantly sensitive to nonlinear distortion because of the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of its envelope. Four signal representation techniques are presented and compared.

AH four are applied to a Bessel Fourier behavioural model for a GaN nonlinear PA. This model is a particularly suitable tool for large dynamic range nonlinearity analysis of certain classes of multicarrier signals.

The analysis method is a co-simulation between an FDTD-based electromagnetic simulator and a semiconduc- tor device simulator. Using this method, it is possible to consider various electromagnetic coupling between transmission lines and active devices with nonlinear characteristics. Furthermore, a semiconductor device simulation is more accurate than an approximation to a large-signal equivalent circuit. The incor- porated simulation was demonstrated for a millimeter-wave amplifier module which consists of an HFET and planar dielec- tric transmission lines (PDTL) at 60-GHz region. The PDTL with a surface wave transmission mode has a low-loss transmission characteristic at millimeter-wave region using a low-loss ceramic substrate. However, the transmission wave on the PDTL tends to be scattered by discontinuity structures and impedance mis- matching. Furthermore, it is predicted that reflected scattered waves at edges of the substrate interfere the PDTL and transis- tors mounted on the PDTL. Using the co-simulation technique, influence of the scattering waves was investigated in detail for the amplifier module.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","HEMTs","MODFETs","Circuit simulation","Millimeter wave technology","Millimeter wave transistors","Electromagnetic scattering","Analytical models","Semiconductor devices","Planar transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic coupling","equivalent circuits","finite difference time-domain analysis","high electron mobility transistors","millimetre wave amplifiers","semiconductor devices","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global analysis","surface wave mode HFET amplifier","EM-device cosimulation","millimeter-wave amplifier module","surface wave mode transmission lines","FDTD","electromagnetic simulator","semiconductor device simulator","electromagnetic coupling","large-signal equivalent circuit","planar dielectric transmission lines","low-loss ceramic substrate","impedance mismatching","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMICC.2007.4412678","publicationTitle":"2007 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412607/4412608/04412678.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMICC.2007.4412678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global analysis for a surface wave mode HFET amplifier module at 60 GHz by EM-device co-simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Global analysis for a surface wave mode HFET amplifier module at 60 GHz by EM-device co-simulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412678/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412678/","accessionNumber":"9901823","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global analysis for a surface wave mode HFET amplifier module at 60 GHz by EM-device co-simulation","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-12082007-000070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032496S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412607","isNumber":"4412608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412607","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4412608","articleId":"4412678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4412679,"authors":[{"name":"Bal S.

From the theoretical stability analysis and numerical simulation, it is found that the Mur's first order ABC in the ADI-FDTD method will be unstable.","doi":"10.1109/EMICC.2007.4412781","publicationTitle":"2007 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412607/4412608/04412781.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMICC.2007.4412781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of stability and numerical dispersion relation of mur's absorbing boundary condition in the ADI-FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412781/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of stability and numerical dispersion relation of mur's absorbing boundary condition in the ADI-FDTD method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9803439","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412781/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of stability and numerical dispersion relation of mur's absorbing boundary condition in the ADI-FDTD method","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-12082007-000173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055074S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412607","isNumber":"4412608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412607","xplore-issue":"4412608","articleId":"4412781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4412829,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros G.

The projection histograms of segmented human body silhouette are used as the main feature vector for posture classification. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm and evidence accumulation technique is proposed to infer human postures. With this technique we have achieved a robust recognition rate of above 90% and a stable classifier's output. The modified classifier structure also improves greatly the recognition rate of lying toward the camera events as compared to the result of classifier's structure in GHOST (Haritaoglu et al., 1998). Furthermore, we use the speed of fall to differentiate real fall incident and an event where the person is simply lying without falling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412795/4412796/04412853.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"206","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Video Surveillance for Monitoring Elderly in Home Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video surveillance","Senior citizens","Event detection","Cameras","Humans","Computerized monitoring","Object detection","Injuries","Home computing","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geriatrics","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent video surveillance","elderly monitoring","home environments","posture-based events","projection histograms","human body silhouette segmentation","k-nearest neighbor algorithm","evidence accumulation technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["home surveillance","fall detection","posture recognition","elder monitoring"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Video Surveillance for Monitoring Elderly in Home Environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412853/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9781871","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Video Surveillance for Monitoring Elderly in Home Environments","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"MMSP-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065499S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412795","isNumber":"4412796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412795","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4412796","articleId":"4412853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4412868,"authors":[{"name":"George Papandreou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Papandreou","id":"37282695800"},{"name":"Athanassios Katsamanis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanassios","lastName":"Katsamanis","id":"37395437200"},{"name":"Vassilis Pitsikalis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Vassilis","lastName":"Pitsikalis","id":"37332602600"},{"name":"Petros Maragos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Maragos","id":"37285070800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1273-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1274-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412868","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Streaming media","Measurement uncertainty","Hidden Markov models","Electric variables measurement","Noise measurement","Probability","Humans","Working environment noise","Automatic speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-visual systems","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain features learning","learning rules","audio-visual speech recognition","adaptive multimodal fusion rules"]}],"abstract":"We study the effect of uncertain feature measurements and show how classification and learning rules should be adjusted to compensate for it.

For such applications, by taking the measurement noise uncertainty of each feature stream into account, the proposed framework leads to highly adaptive multimodal fusion rules for classification and learning which are widely applicable and easy to implement. We further show that previous multimodal fusion methods relying on stream weights fall under our scheme under certain assumptions; this provides novel insights into their applicability for various tasks and suggests new practical ways for estimating the stream weights adaptively.

In this paper, we present a bandwidth aware motion compensation (BAMC) which can solve both the read cycle and the data bandwidth problems in various systems. BAMC saves 60-80% MC read cycle and 50-85% data bandwidth at the system with DDR1-32bit or DDR2-64 bit.

Scientific questions that may benefit from the use of imaging techniques are often more robustly addressed with data acquired from complementary imaging modalities, intensifying the need for performing cross-modality image registration and fusion. In this work, a methodology for multimodal coregistration and fusion of MRI and PET volumes is presented with the aim of visualizing the biodistribution of a radiolabeled compound (from PET) in a high-resolution anatomical reference image (from MRI). The use of an animal platform and fiducial markers for defining spatial correspondences is considered first, followed by a preliminary automated alignment approach that calculates and matches shape-based features using Parzen estimators and genetic algorithm optimization. Experimental results are also presented, followed by concluding remarks and future perspectives on our work.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412795/4412796/04412883.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"327","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multimodal Image Registration and Fusion Methodology Applied to Drug Discovery Research","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image registration","Drugs","Magnetic resonance imaging","Positron emission tomography","Pharmaceuticals","Robustness","High-resolution imaging","Data visualization","Animals","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image registration","magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimodal image registration","fusion methodology","drug discovery research","MRI","genetic algorithm optimization","Parzen estimators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multimodal Image Registration and Fusion Methodology Applied to Drug Discovery Research","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412883/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9781901","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multimodal Image Registration and Fusion Methodology Applied to Drug Discovery Research","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"MMSP-00-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117468S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412795","isNumber":"4412796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412795","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4412796","articleId":"4412883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4412884,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Hasegawa-Johnson","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Hasegawa-Johnson","id":"38270154300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1273-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1274-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412884","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"This paper proposes a multi-stream approach to automatic audiovisual speech recognition, based in part on Hickok and Poeppel's dual-stream model of human speech processing. The dual-stream model proposes that semantic networks may be accessed by at least three parallel neural streams: at least two ventral streams that map directly from acoustics to words (with different time scales), and at least one dorsal stream that maps from acoustics to articulation. Our implementation represents each of these streams by a dynamic Bayesian network; disagreements between the three streams are resolved using a voting scheme. The proposed algorithm was tested using the CUAVE audiovisual speech corpus. Results indicate that the ventral stream model tends to make fewer mistakes in the labeling of vowels, while the dorsal stream model tends to make fewer mistakes in the labeling of consonants; the recognizer voting scheme takes advantage of these differences to reduce overall word error rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412795/4412796/04412884.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Stream Approach to Audiovisual Automatic Speech Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","Streaming media","Speech recognition","Voting","Labeling","Humans","Speech processing","Bayesian methods","Acoustic testing","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-visual systems","belief networks","semantic networks","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistream approach","audiovisual automatic speech recognition","dual-stream model","human speech processing","semantic networks","parallel neural streams","dynamic Bayesian network","word error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Stream Approach to Audiovisual Automatic Speech Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412884/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9781902","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Stream Approach to Audiovisual Automatic Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"MMSP-00-88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051224S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412795","isNumber":"4412796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412795","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4412796","articleId":"4412884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4412899,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Chung Lin","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao-Chung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37578091700"},{"name":"David Varodayan","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Varodayan","id":"37297703600"},{"name":"Bernd Girod","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Girod","id":"37283315200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1273-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1274-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4412899","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"abstract":"Media authentication is important in content delivery via untrusted intermediaries, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. Many differently encoded versions of a media file might exist. Our previous work applied distributed source coding to distinguish the legitimate diversity of encoded images from tampering. An authentication decoder was supplied with a Slepian-Wolf encoded lossy version of the image as authentication data. Distributed source coding provided the desired robustness against legitimate encoding variations, while detecting illegitimate modification. We augment the decoder to localize tampering in an image already deemed to be unauthentic. The localization decoder requires only incremental localization data beyond the authentication data since we use rate-adaptive distributed source codes. Both decoders perform joint bitplane decoding, rather than conditional bitplane decoding. Our results demonstrate that tampered image blocks can be identified with high probability using authentication plus localization data of only a few hundred bytes for a 512times512 image.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Source coding","Decoding","Image coding","Watermarking","Cryptography","Peer to peer computing","Data mining","Transform

Adding supercapacitor energy storage to distributed power systems improves power quality and efficiency and reduces capital expenses by allowing the systems to be sized more closely to the steady-state power requirements rather than over-sizing the main generator to meet transient loading requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-February  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412942/","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4412942/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9748003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January-February 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Drive friendly","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drive friendly","sourcePdf":"62008--24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061657S","chronDate":"January-February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8014","isNumber":"4408514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8014","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4408514","articleId":"4412942","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4412994,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhu","affiliation":["Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279329900"},{"name":"Venkata Gopala Krishna Addada","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Systems, George Mason University, USA"],"firstName":"Venkata Gopala Krishna","lastName":"Addada","id":"37567316500"},{"name":"Sanjeev Setia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, George Mason University, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Setia","id":"37269722100"},{"name":"Sushil Jajodia","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Systems, George Mason University, USA"],"firstName":"Sushil","lastName":"Jajodia","id":"37269731300"},{"name":"Sankardas Roy","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Systems, George Mason University, USA"],"firstName":"Sankardas","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400810600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3060-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3060-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9527"}],"articleNumber":"4412994","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"abstract":"Wireless sensor nodes lack hardware support for tamper- resistance and are often deployed in unattended environments, thus leaving them vulnerable to capture and compromise by an adversary. In a node replication attack, an adversary uses the credentials of a compromised node to surreptitiously introduce replicas of that node into the network. These replicas are then used to launch a variety of attacks that subvert the goal of the sensor application, and the operation of the underlying protocols. We present a novel distributed approach called Localized Multicast for detecting node replication attacks. We evaluate the performance and security of our approach both theoretically and via simulation. Our results show that Localized Multicast is more efficient than previous distributed approaches in terms of communication and memory costs. Further, in our approach, the probability of detecting node replicas is much higher than that achieved in previous distributed protocols.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Information systems","Sensor systems and applications","Communication system security","Hardware","Computer security","Application software","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast protocols","security of data","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed node replication attack detection","wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor nodes","tamper resistance","sensor application","localized multicast","security"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSAC.2007.26","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Third Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Third Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412959/4412960/04412994.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2007.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Distributed Detection of Node Replication Attacks in Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4412994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Distributed Detection of Node Replication Attacks in Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4412994/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4412994/","accessionNumber":"9903935","conferenceDate":"10-14 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Distributed Detection of Node Replication Attacks in Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"30600257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06237S","chronDate":"10-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412959","isNumber":"4412960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412959","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4412960","articleId":"4412994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4413008,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Moser","affiliation":["Secure Systems Laboratory, Technical University of of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Moser","id":"37666023700"},{"name":"Christopher Kruegel","affiliation":["Secure Systems Laboratory, Technical University of of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Kruegel","id":"37283981400"},{"name":"Engin Kirda","affiliation":["Secure Systems Laboratory, Technical University of of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Engin","lastName":"Kirda","id":"37298605700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3060-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3060-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9527"}],"articleNumber":"4413008","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":329,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":5504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Registers","Computer security","Face detection","Application software","Pattern matching","Performance analysis","Power system modeling","Internet","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invasive software","program diagnostics","program verification","theorem proving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static analysis","malware detection","malicious code","computer systems security","virus detection","spyware scanner","pattern matching","code transformation","semantic signatures","model checking","theorem proving","obfuscation transformation","program control flow"]}],"abstract":"Malicious code is an increasingly important problem that threatens the security of computer systems. The traditional line of defense against malware is composed of malware detectors such as virus and spyware scanners. Unfortunately, both researchers and malware authors have demonstrated that these scanners, which use pattern matching to identify malware, can be easily evaded by simple code transformations. To address this shortcoming, more powerful malware detectors have been proposed. These tools rely on semantic signatures and employ static analysis techniques such as model checking and theorem proving to perform detection. While it has been shown that these systems are highly effective in identifying current malware, it is less clear how successful they would be against adversaries that take into account the novel detection mechanisms. The goal of this paper is to explore the limits of static analysis for the detection of malicious code. To this end, we present a binary obfuscation scheme that relies on the idea of opaque constants, which are primitives that allow us to load a constant into a register such that an analysis tool cannot determine its value. Based on opaque constants, we build obfuscation transformations that obscure program control flow, disguise access to local and global variables, and interrupt tracking of values held in processor registers. Using our proposed obfuscation approach, we were able to show that advanced semantics-based malware detectors can be evaded. Moreover, our opaque constant primitive can be applied in a way such that is provably hard to analyze for any static code analyzer. This demonstrates that static analysis techniques alone might no longer be sufficient to identify malware.","doi":"10.1109/ACSAC.2007.21","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Third Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Third Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4412959/4412960/04413008.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2007.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4412960","startPage":"421","endPage":"430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limits of Static Analysis for Malware Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Limits of Static Analysis for Malware Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413008/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9903937","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4413008/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limits of Static Analysis for Malware Detection","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"30600421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072524S","chronDate":"10-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4412959","isNumber":"4412960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4412959","citationCount":"329","xplore-issue":"4412960","articleId":"4413008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4413033,"authors":[{"name":"Mutlu Mete","affiliation":["University of Arkansas, Little Rock, USA"],"firstName":"Mutlu","lastName":"Mete","id":"37639973000"},{"name":"Xiaowei Xu","affiliation":["University of Arkansas, Little Rock, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37402620400"},{"name":"Chun-Yang Fan","affiliation":["University of Arkanas for Medical Sciences, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Yang","lastName":"Fan","id":"37833365100"},{"name":"Gal Shafirstein","affiliation":["University of Arkanas for Medical Sciences, USA"],"firstName":"Gal","lastName":"Shafirstein","id":"37832897900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3031-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3031-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4413033","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Magnetic heads","Neck","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","cellular biophysics","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical diagnostic computing","pattern clustering","tumours","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","squamous cell carcinoma identification","head-neck cancer","computer vision system","automatic delineation","virtual histological slide","density-based clustering algorithm","proliferative cell nuclei"]}],"abstract":"Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of head and neck cancer affecting about 30,000 Americans each year [1].

Computer vision systems have yet to contribute significantly to the investigation of tumor areas in terms of histological slide analysis. Recently the improvements in imaging techniques led to the discovery of virtual histological slides. Virtual slides are of sufficiently high quality to generate immense interest within the research community. We describe a novel method to tackle automatic delineation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma problem in virtual histological slides. A density-based clustering algorithm improved in this study plays a key role in the determination of the proliferative cell nuclei. The experimental results on high-resolution head and neck slides show that the proposed algorithm performed well, obtaining an average of 96% accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Machine Learning Approach for Identification of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM 2007)","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2007.57","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413017/4413018/04413033.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2007.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413018","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Machine Learning Approach for Identification of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413033/","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9882684","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Machine Learning Approach for Identification of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","confLoc":"Fremont, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"30310029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046587S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413017","isNumber":"4413018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413017","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4413018","articleId":"4413033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4413041,"authors":[{"name":"Winnie W.

Previous works on genome comparison focus mainly on comparing the entire genome at the nucleotide level. As interesting patterns exist also at the gene and segment level, we propose an algorithm called Multi- Level Genome Comparison Algorithm (MGC) that can allow genome comparison to be performed at multi-level while sequential and regional consistency of gene segments can be determined. Different genomes may have common sub-sequences that differ with each other due to processes such as mutations, lateral transfers, gene rearrangements that cannot be easily identified. The result is that not all the genes can form a certain one-to-one matching gene pair. One-to-many or many-to-many ambiguity relationships may exist . MGC takes this ambiguity into consideration and represents genomes with a new graph representation known as Multi-Level Attributed Graph Mining Algorithm (MAGMA). We tested MGC with the intra- and inter-species of Chlamydia genomes. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to discover the similarities and dissimilarities among different genomes, while in addition, to confirm the specific role of the gene in the genomes and provide variations among species and similarity within species.

We present experimental results on the transmission performance of 111 Gbit/s POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK. For a dense WDM setup with channels carrying 111 Gbit/s with a 50 GHz channel spacing (2.0 bits/s/Hz), we show the feasibility of 2375 km transmission. This is enabled through coherent detection which results in excellent noise performance, and subsequent electronic equalization which provides the high tolerance to polarization mode dispersion and chromatic dispersion (CD). Furthermore, we discuss the impact of sampling and digital signal processing with either 1 or 2 samples/bit. We show that when combined with low-pass electrical filtering, 1 sample/bit signal processing is sufficient to obtain a large tolerance towards CD. The proposed modulation and detection techniques enable 111 Gbit/s transmission that is directly compatible with the existing 10 Gbit/s infrastructure.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.912128","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4451199/04413092.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.912128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent Equalization and POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK for Robust 100-GE Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coherent Equalization and POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK for Robust 100-GE Transmission","volume":"26","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9794385","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413092/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413092/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent Equalization and POLMUX-RZ-DQPSK for Robust 100-GE Transmission","sourcePdf":"26jlt01-fludger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127924S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4451199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"4451199","articleId":"4413092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4413093,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, their lower tolerance to linear and nonlinear fiber impairments remains a major drawback for field deployment. To address the issue of linear impairments, coherent detection of multilevel formats with polarization division multiplexing appears as a promising solution by reducing the symbol rate to 10 Gbaud. Indeed, such coherent based systems have already demonstrated an improved tolerance to optical noise and an interesting capability to compensate for large amount of chromatic dispersion. In this paper, the tolerances to narrow optical filtering, chromatic dispersion, and polarization mode dispersion are investigated with coherent detection of 10-Gbaud quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) with and without polarization division multiplexing. Moreover, the efficient mitigation of these linear impairments by digital processing in a coherent receiver is demonstrated in an ultralong haul transmission (4080 km) of 40-Gb/s QPSK polarization multiplexed data.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4451199/04413096.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.911893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.911893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Fiber Impairments Mitigation of 40-Gbit/s Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK by Digital Processing in a Coherent Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber polarization","Quadrature phase shift keying","Optical noise","Chromatic dispersion","Optical filters","Optical receivers","Costs","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre filters","optical fibre polarisation","optical information processing","optical modulation","optical noise","optical receivers","quadrature phase shift keying","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear fiber impairments mitigation","polarization-multiplexed QPSK","digital signal processing","coherent receiver","ultralong haul transmission","coherent based systems","optical noise","chromatic dispersion","narrow optical filtering","polarization mode dispersion","coherent detection","quadrature phase shift keying","polarization division multiplexing","WDM","bit rate 40 Gbit/s","distance 4080 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent detection","digital signal processing","optical fiber communications","phase-shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Linear Fiber Impairments Mitigation of 40-Gbit/s Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK by Digital Processing in a Coherent Receiver","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4413096/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2008","accessionNumber":"9794398","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Fiber Impairments Mitigation of 40-Gbit/s Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK by Digital Processing in a Coherent Receiver","sourcePdf":"26jlt01-renaudier.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102764S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4451199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4451199","articleId":"4413096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4413097,"authors":[{"name":"Micha\u00cbl A.

Distributed-parallel-processor (DPP) implementations of the systolic arrays allow synchronous sampling of the 2D input signal array, but because of the direct-form structure they have high circuit complexity. To address the high-complexity problem, the differential-form 2D z-domain transfer function is employed here to obtain a novel DPP systolic-array-based filter architecture. Differential operators are obtained by applying elemental predistortion to the passive LR prototype filter network using series-connected negative-resistance elements. The proposed systolic 2D IIR architecture is implemented on a single Xilinx Virtex-4 Xc4v Sx35-10ff668 FPGA chip. Two examples of broadband plane-wave filtering supporting N = 32 and N = 64 sensors are reported.

In this paper, a new THP algorithm using the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion is developed for the downlink of multi-user MIMO systems. This algorithm, called the MMSE THP algorithm, provides significant performance improvement compared to the zero-forcing (ZF) THP algorithm discussed in the literature. Moreover, ordering of the rows of the channel matrix is found to be important to the THP system performance, and the way in which this ordering affects the system structure is presented. An ordering lemma that generalizes the conditions, under which the \"best-first\" ordering is optimal, is introduced.With this lemma it is proved that the \"best-first\" ordering method achieves the optimal order in the minimax noise-variance sense for the ZF THP and the optimal order in the minimax error-variance sense for the MMSE THP.

The fixed relay scheme employs a relay that has a fixed location to help the cognitive network base station detect the presence of the primary user. The variable relay sensing scheme employs cognitive users distributed at various locations as relays to sense data and to improve the detection capabilities. This effectively reduces the average detection time by exploiting spatial diversity inherent in multiuser networks.

Spectrum sensing is one of the essential mechanisms of CRs and its operational aspects are being investigated actively. However, the security aspects of spectrum sensing have garnered little attention. In this paper, we identify a threat to spectrum sensing, which we call the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">primary user emulation (PUE) attack</i>\n. In this attack, an adversary's CR transmits signals whose characteristics emulate those of incumbent signals. The highly flexible, software-based air interface of CRs makes such an attack possible. Our investigation shows that a PUE attack can severely interfere with the spectrum sensing process and significantly reduce the channel resources available to legitimate unlicensed users. To counter this threat, we propose a transmitter verification scheme, called \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LocDef (localization-based defense)</i>\n, which verifies whether a given signal is that of an incumbent transmitter by estimating its location and observing its signal characteristics. To estimate the location of the signal transmitter, LocDef employs a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">non-interactive localization</i>\n scheme.

A fundamental challenge for realizing such a system is to ensure the quality of service (QoS) of the PUs as well as to maximize the throughput or ensure the QoS, such as signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), of the secondary users (SUs). In this paper, we study single-input multiple output multiple access channels (SIMO-MAC) for the CR network. Subject to interference constraints for the PUs as well as peak power constraints for the SUs, two optimization problems involving a joint beamforming and power allocation for the CR network are considered: the sum-rate maximization problem and the SINR balancing problem. For the sum-rate maximization problem, zero-forcing based decision feedback equalizers are used to decouple the SIMO-MAC, and a capped multi-level (CML) water-filling algorithm is proposed to maximize the achievable sum-rate of the SUs for the single PU case. When multiple PUs exist, a recursive decoupled power allocation algorithm is proposed to derive the optimal power allocation solution. For the SINR balancing problem, it is shown that, using linear minimum mean-square-error receivers, each of the interference constraints and peak power constraints can be completely decoupled, and thus the multi-constraint optimization problem can be solved through multiple single-constraint sub-problems. Theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithms is presented, together with numerical simulations which compare the performances of different power allocation schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4413132/04413139.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation for Multiple Access Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Interference constraints","Chromium","Quality of service","Signal to noise ratio","Constraint optimization","Radio spectrum management","Throughput","Decision feedback equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","constraint theory","decision feedback equalisers","mean square error methods","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","optimisation","quality of service","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint beamforming","power allocation algorithm","SIMO multiple access channels","cognitive radio networks","CR network","frequency band","primary users","quality of service","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios","secondary users","throughput maximization","single-input multiple output channels","interference constraints","peak power constraints","optimization problems","sum-rate maximization problem","SINR balancing problem","zero-forcing based decision feedback equalizers","CMLwater-filling algorithm","capped multilevel algorithm","linear minimum mean-square-error receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation for Multiple Access Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4413139/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9775838","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation for Multiple Access Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"108jsac038zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115814S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"316","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413139","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4413140,"authors":[{"name":"Watcharapan Suwansantisuk","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4413132/4413140/4413140-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Watcharapan Suwansantisuk (S'04) received the B.S. degrees (with Honors) in Electrical and Computer Engineering and in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2002.

Due to their high degree of adaptability to environmental variations, cognitive radios are expected to utilize packet-based transmission with variable-length frames. Packet-based transmission requires the receiver to perform frame synchronization, an important enabling step that allows adaptation in cognitive radios. However, proper metrics to characterize the performance of frame synchronization for transmission of variable-length frames are currently unavailable. To address this issue, we put forth two performance metrics, namely the expected duration to complete frame synchronization and the probability of correct acquisition within a given duration. We then develop analytical expressions for these important metrics. This paper advances our understanding of frame synchronization for the continuous transmission of variable-length frames and for bursty transmission.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4413132/04413140.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frame Synchronization for Variable-Length Packets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frame Synchronization for Variable-Length Packets","volume":"26","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9775839","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413140/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413140/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frame Synchronization for Variable-Length Packets","sourcePdf":"108jsac052Suwan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130273S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4413141,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Qu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4413132/4413141/4413141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Qu received the B.S.E degree from the Institute of Communications and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in June, 2002 and the M.S. degree (with honors) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA, in May 2004.

A low-complexity adaptive transmission protocol is described and evaluated for use in cognitive radio networks whose links have unknown and possibly time-varying propagation losses as a result of such phenomena as slow fading or variations in shadowing. The cognitive radios are required to derive only simple statistics in the receivers in order to provide the information that is needed by our protocol; no estimates or measurements of received power or channel gain are used. The protocol's primary mechanism for responding to changes in propagation loss is to adjust the modulation and coding. Because of disruptions that can be caused by higher levels of interference to other radios in the network, the transmitter power is increased only if the most powerful combination of coding and modulation is inadequate. We employ finite-state Markov models for slowly varying channels, and we demonstrate that for such channels our protocol performs nearly as well as an ideal protocol that is told the exact value of the propagation loss for each packet transmission. Thus, the additional complexity that is required to enable cognitive radios to obtain precise channel-gain estimates is not justified and would lead to only negligible improvement in throughput. The throughput of our adaptive transmission protocol is compared with an upper bound that is derived from information theory for a hypothetical ideal protocol that is given perfect channel-state information, and some preliminary results on learning the adaptation decision intervals are included.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4413132/04413142.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Adaptive Transmission for Cognitive Radios in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Adaptive Transmission for Cognitive Radios in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","volume":"26","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9775841","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413142/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Adaptive Transmission for Cognitive Radios in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"108jsac083pursley.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06278S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4413143,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Geirhofer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4413132/4413143/4413143-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Geirhofer (S05) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, Austria, in 2005.

Cognitive medium access (CMA) is derived from this model by recasting the problem as one of constrained Markov decision processes. Solutions are obtained by linear programming. Furthermore, we show that optimal CMA admits structured solutions, simplifying practical implementations. Preliminary results for the partially observable case are presented.

Recent reports show that most available spectrum has been allocated. While some of the spectrum bands (e.g., unlicensed band, GSM band) have seen increasingly crowded usage, most of the other spectrum resources are underutilized. This drives the emergence of open spectrum and dynamic spectrum access concepts, which allow unlicensed users equipped with cognitive radios to opportunistically access the spectrum not used by primary users. Cognitive radio has many advanced features, such as agilely sensing the existence of primary users and utilizing multiple spectrum bands simultaneously. However, in practice such capabilities are constrained by hardware cost. In this paper, we discuss how to conduct efficient spectrum management in ad hoc cognitive radio networks while taking the hardware constraints (e.g., single radio, partial spectrum sensing and spectrum aggregation limit) into consideration. A hardware-constrained cognitive MAC, HC-MAC, is proposed to conduct efficient spectrum sensing and spectrum access decision. We identify the issue of optimal spectrum sensing decision for a single secondary transmission pair, and formulate it as an optimal stopping problem. A decentralized MAC protocol is then proposed for the ad hoc cognitive radio networks. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed protocol.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","volume":"26","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9775842","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413144/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"HC-MAC: A Hardware-Constrained Cognitive MAC for Efficient Spectrum Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HC-MAC: A Hardware-Constrained Cognitive MAC for Efficient Spectrum Management","sourcePdf":"108jsac106jia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070665S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"495","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4413145,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Su","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4413132/4413145/4413145-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hang Su received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

Specifically, the MAC protocols enable the secondary users to identify and utilize the leftover frequency spectrum in a way that constrains the level of interference to the primary users. In our proposed protocols, each secondary user is equipped with two transceivers. One transceiver is tuned to the dedicated control channel, while the other is designed specifically as a cognitive radio that can periodically sense and dynamically use the identified un-used channels. To obtain the channel state accurately, we propose two collaborative channel spectrum-sensing policies, namely, the random sensing policy and the negotiation-based sensing policy, to help the MAC protocols detect the availability of leftover channels. Under the random sensing policy, each secondary user just randomly selects one of the channels for sensing. On the other hand, under the negotiation-based sensing policy, different secondary users attempt to select the distinct channels to sense by overhearing the control packets over the control channel. We develop the Markov chain model and the M/G\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Y</sup>\n/1-based queueing model to characterize the performance of our proposed multi-channel MAC protocols under the two types of channel-sensing policies for the saturation network and the non-saturation network scenarios, respectively.

Without being restricted to any prefixed spectrum bands, nodes choose operating spectrum on-demand. Such flexibility, however, makes efficient and fair spectrum access in large-scale networks a great challenge. Prior work in this area focused on explicit coordination where nodes communicate with peers to modify local spectrum allocation, and may heavily stress the communication resource. In this paper, we introduce a distributed spectrum management architecture where nodes share spectrum resource fairly by making independent actions following spectrum rules. We present five spectrum rules to regulate node behavior and maximize system fairness and spectrum utilization, and analyze the associated complexity and overhead. We show analytically and experimentally that the proposed rule-based approach achieves similar performance with the explicit coordination approach, while significantly reducing communication cost.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4413132/04413146.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Rule-Regulated Spectrum Sharing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413146/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Rule-Regulated Spectrum Sharing","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9816540","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413146/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Rule-Regulated Spectrum Sharing","sourcePdf":"108jsac130cao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096273S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4413147,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is a frequency-agile data communication device that is vastly more powerful than recently proposed multi-channel multi-radio (MC-MR) technology. In this paper, we investigate the important problem of multi-hop networking with CR nodes. For such a network, each node has a pool of frequency bands (typically of unequal size) that can be used for communication. The potential difference in the bandwidth among the available frequency bands prompts the need to further divide these bands into sub-bands for optimal spectrum sharing. We characterize the behavior and constraints for such a multi-hop CR network from multiple layers, including modeling of spectrum sharing and sub-band division, scheduling and interference constraints, and flow routing. We develop a mathematical formulation with the objective of minimizing the required network-wide radio spectrum resource for a set of user sessions. Since the formulated model is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard in general, we develop a lower bound for the objective by relaxing the integer variables and using a linearization technique. Subsequently, we design a near-optimal algorithm to solve this MINLP problem. This algorithm is based on a novel sequential fixing procedure, where the integer variables are determined iteratively via a sequence of linear programs. Simulation results show that solutions obtained by this algorithm are very close to the lower bounds obtained via the proposed relaxation, thus suggesting that the solution produced by the algorithm is near-optimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4413132/04413147.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sharing for Multi-Hop Networking with Cognitive Radios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Cognitive radio","Signal processing algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Chromium","Interference constraints","Signal processing","Radio frequency","Communication switching","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","integer programming","linear programming","minimisation","resource allocation","spectral analysers","telecommunication network routing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop networking","cognitive radio","signal processing","radio frequency reconfiguration","frequency-agile data communication device","multichannel multiradio technology","flow routing","interference constraint","scheduling","network-wide radio spectrum resource sharing","mixed-integer nonlinear program","NP-hard problem","sequential fixing procedure","user session"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sharing for Multi-Hop Networking with Cognitive Radios","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4413147/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9901456","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sharing for Multi-Hop Networking with Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"108jsac146hou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081563S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4413148,"authors":[{"name":"Ala Al-Fuqaha","affiliation":["Western Michigan University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4413132/4413148/4413148-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ala Al-Fuqaha (S'00\u2013M'04) received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Missouri, in 1999 and 2004 respectively.

We propose new techniques to leverage two optimizations for cognitive radio networks that are specific to such contexts: opportunistic channel selection and cooperative mobility. We present a new formal model for MANETs consisting of cognitive radio capable nodes that are willing to be moved (at a cost). We develop an effective decentralized algorithm for mobility planning, and powerful new Altering and fuzzy based techniques for both channel estimation and channel selection. Our experiments are compelling and demonstrate that the communications infrastructure-specifically, connection bit error rates-can be significantly improved by leveraging our proposed techniques. In addition, we find that these cooperative/opportunistic optimization spaces do not trade-off significantly with one another, and thus can be used simultaneously to build superior hybrid schemes. Our results have significant applications in high-performance mission-oriented MANETs, such as battlefield communications and domestic response & rescue missions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9901457","htmlLink":"/document/4413148/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Channel Selection Strategy for Better QoS in Cooperative Networks with Cognitive Radio Capabilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Channel Selection Strategy for Better QoS in Cooperative Networks with Cognitive Radio Capabilities","sourcePdf":"108jsac156fuqaha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062785S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4413149,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik R.

Mesh routers (MR) form the connectivity backbone while performing the dual tasks of packet forwarding as well as providing network access to the mesh clients. However, the performance of such networks is limited by traffic congestion, as only limited bandwidth is available for supporting the large number of nodes in close proximity. This problem can be alleviated by the cognitive radio paradigm that aims at devising spectrum sensing and management techniques, thereby allowing radios to intelligently locate and use frequencies other than those in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. These promising technologies are integrated in our proposed Cognitive Mesh NETwork (COMNET) algorithmic framework, thus realizing an intelligent frequency-shifting self-managed mesh network. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) A new approach for spectrum sensing is devised without any change to the working of existing de facto mesh protocols. (2) An analytical model is proposed that allows MRs to estimate the power in a given channel and location due to neighboring wireless LAN traffic, thus creating a virtual map in space and frequency domains. (3) These models are used to formulate the task of channel assignment within the mesh network as an optimization problem, which is solved in a decentralized manner. Our analytical models are validated through simulation study, and results reveal the benefits of load sharing by adopting unused frequencies for WMN traffic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9775844","htmlLink":"/document/4413149/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks with Dynamic Spectrum Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks with Dynamic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"108jsac168chowd.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069976S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4413150,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Ji","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4413132/4413150/4413150-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhu Ji received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Maryland, College Park in May 2007.

However, the collusion among selfish network users may seriously deteriorate the efficiency of dynamic spectrum sharing. The network users' behaviors and dynamics need to be taken into consideration for efficient and robust spectrum allocation. In this paper, we model the spectrum allocation in wireless networks with multiple selfish legacy spectrum holders and unlicensed users as multi-stage dynamic games. In order to combat user collusion, we propose a pricing-based collusion-resistant dynamic spectrum allocation approach to optimize overall spectrum efficiency, while not only keeping the participating incentives of the selfish users but also combating possible user collusion. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of spectrum usage even with the presence of severe user collusion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","volume":"26","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9901458","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413150/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Stage Pricing Game for Collusion-Resistant Dynamic Spectrum Allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Stage Pricing Game for Collusion-Resistant Dynamic Spectrum Allocation","sourcePdf":"108jsac182ji.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081744S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4413152,"authors":[{"name":"O.

According to the property-rights model of cognitive radio, the primary terminals own a given bandwidth and may decide to lease it for a fraction of time to secondary nodes in exchange for appropriate remuneration. In this paper, we propose and analyze an implementation of this framework, whereby a primary link has the possibility to lease the owned spectrum to an ad hoc network of secondary nodes in exchange for cooperation in the form of distributed space-time coding. On one hand, the primary link attempts to maximize its quality of service in terms of either rate or probability of outage, accounting for the possible contribution from cooperation. On the other hand, nodes in the secondary ad hoc network compete among themselves for transmission within the leased time-slot following a distributed power control mechanism. The investigated model is conveniently cast in the framework of Stackelberg games. We consider both a baseline scenario with full channel state information and information-theoretic transmission strategies, and a more practical model with long-term channel state information and randomized distributed space-time coding. Analysis and numerical results show that spectrum leasing based on trading secondary spectrum access for cooperation is a promising framework for cognitive radio.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4413132/04413152.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Leasing to Cooperating Secondary Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Remuneration","Quality of service","Channel state information","Information theory","Wireless communication","Frequency","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","game theory","power control","quality of service","radio links","random codes","space-time codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum leasing","cooperating secondary ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","secondary spectrum access","primary link","randomized distributed space-time coding","quality of service","distributed power control mechanism","Stackelberg games","channel state information","information-theoretic transmission strategies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Leasing to Cooperating Secondary Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4413152/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9901459","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Leasing to Cooperating Secondary Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"108jsac203simeone.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107335S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4413132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"472","xplore-issue":"4413132","articleId":"4413152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4413312,"authors":[{"name":"Taikang Ning","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Hartford, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Taikang","lastName":"Ning","id":"37276642600"},{"name":"Sagar Bhandari","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Hartford, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Sagar","lastName":"Bhandari","id":"37838274100"},{"name":"Nikolay A.

Using DGPS corrections prediction can reduce these errors to a certain extent, with the exception of SA. This makes it possible to enhance the accuracy of GPS positioning by a factor of twenty five. This paper presents a recurrent wavelet neural network (RWNN) for improving positioning accuracy. Method validity is verified with experimental data from an actual data collection, before and after SA The results show very clearly the dramatic change in the error value. It also shows that by using proposed method over a long period of time, 0.7 m GPS accuracy can be achieved. Also, it is shown that RWNN outperforms single WNN and RNN.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413579","startPage":"3029","endPage":"3033","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413579.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive correction technique for DGPS using recurrent wavelet neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413579/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An adaptive correction technique for DGPS using recurrent wavelet neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413579/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9848043","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive correction technique for DGPS using recurrent wavelet neural network","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056184S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4413591,"authors":[{"name":"Ishmael S.

Water supply entities therefore have the responsibility to supply clean and safe water at the rate required by the consumer. It is therefore necessary to implement mechanisms and systems that can be employed to predict both short-term and long-term water demands. The increasingly growing field of computational intelligence techniques has been proposed as an efficient tool in the modelling of dynamic phenomena. The primary objective of this paper is to compare the efficiency of two computational intelligence techniques in water demand forecasting. The techniques under comparison are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this study it was observed that ANNs perform better than SVMs. This performance is measured against the generalisation ability of the two.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413591","startPage":"638","endPage":"643","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413591.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines for water demand time series forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Support vector machines","Demand forecasting","Water resources","Human immunodeficiency virus","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome","Africa","Computational intelligence","Predictive models","Animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental science computing","neural nets","support vector machines","time series","water resources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["water demand time series forecasting","artificial neural network","support vector machine","computational intelligence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines for water demand time series forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848055","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines for water demand time series forecasting","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053505S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":4413596,"authors":[{"name":"Naohiko Suzuki","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Naohiko Suzuki","id":"38236730600"},{"name":"Kosuke Hirasawa","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kosuke Hirasawa","id":"38240489200"},{"name":"Kenichi Tanaka","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kenichi Tanaka","id":"37292346600"},{"name":"Yoshinori Kobayashi","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yoshinori Kobayashi","id":"38089745400"},{"name":"Yoichi Sato","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yoichi Sato","id":"37276345600"},{"name":"Yozo Fujino","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yozo Fujino","id":"38241720000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413596","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion analysis","Motion detection","Humans","Pattern analysis","Hidden Markov models","Event detection","Cameras","Image motion analysis","Laser radar","Video recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","hidden Markov models","image motion analysis","image representation","matrix algebra","object detection","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion pattern learning","anomaly detection","human trajectory analysis","hidden Markov model","time-series feature","similarity matrix","multi dimensional scaling","eigenvector decomposition","k-means clustering","motion pattern representation","unsupervised learning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel method to learn motion patterns and detect anomalies by human trajectory analysis. Human trajectories are various, for example, moving, roaming, pausing, and so on. But, current approaches for the analysis of motion patterns are effective only in understanding simple trajectories. We aim to understand complicated human trajectories with long-term observation. To deal with spatial and temporal features of trajectories, we employ HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to model time-series features of human positions. Next, a similarity matrix of HMM mutual distances is formed. MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling) based on eigenvector decomposition provides projected coordinates of trajectories in low-dimensional space. Then we apply k-means clustering to projected data in order to acquire human motion patterns. Anomalies can be detected by the use of likelihood scores for HMM representing motion patterns. We tested the proposed method by real-world trajectories data observed in a small store. Experimental result shows that our method accurately finds typical motion patterns and unusual trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413596","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","startPage":"498","endPage":"503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning motion patterns and anomaly detection by Human trajectory analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning motion patterns and anomaly detection by Human trajectory analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413596/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848060","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4413596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning motion patterns and anomaly detection by Human trajectory analysis","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055631S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4413635,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao- Hui Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering, Hiroshima Institute of Technology, Hiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Zhao- Hui Jiang","id":"37087380655"},{"name":"Taiki Ishida","affiliation":["Hiroshima Institute of Technology"],"lastName":"Taiki Ishida","id":"37087380918"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413635","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":624},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413635","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Robot control","Industrial control","Service robots","Neural networks","Manipulator dynamics","Electrical equipment industry","Control systems","PD control","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","feedforward","industrial manipulators","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","PD control","position control","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory tracking control","industrial robot manipulators","neural network controller","control system design","parallel subsystems","PD controller","trajectory tracking error regulation","force-torque generation","learning law","feedforward network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413635","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413635.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory tracking control of industrial robot manipulators using a neural network controller","abstract":"In this paper, trajectory tracking control based on a neural network controller for industrial manipulators is addressed.

Because of a SVR approach is equivalent to solving a linear constrained quadratic programming problem under a fixed structure of SVR the number of hidden nodes, the initial parameters and the initial weights of ARFNNs are easy obtained via the SVR approach. Secondly, the results of SVR are used as initial structure in ARFNNs. At the same time, an annealing robust learning algorithm (ARLA) is used as the learning algorithm for ARFNNs, and applied to adjust the parameters in the membership function as well as weights of ARFNNs. That is, an ARLA is proposed to overcome the problems of initialization and the cut-off points in the robust learning algorithm. Hence, when an initial structure of ARFNNs are determined by a SVR approach, the ARFNNs with ARLA have fast convergence speed and robust against outliers for the modeling of molecular biology systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413643","startPage":"3113","endPage":"3118","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413643.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Annealing robust fuzzy neural networks for modeling of molecular biology systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413643/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Annealing robust fuzzy neural networks for modeling of molecular biology systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413643/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9848107","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Annealing robust fuzzy neural networks for modeling of molecular biology systems","confLoc":"Montreal, Que.","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051319S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4413654,"authors":[{"name":"Yanxia Jiang","affiliation":["School of Mangement, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yanxia Jiang","id":"37087579960"},{"name":"Dagang Ke","affiliation":["School of Mangement, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Dagang Ke","id":"37087582064"},{"name":"Yongjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yongjun Wang","id":"37087064962"},{"name":"Lida Xu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, USA"],"lastName":"Lida Xu","id":"37087584073"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413654","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413654","abstract":"This study applies genetic algorithms to select financial statement variables which are used to predict the direction of one-year-ahead earnings change.

An adaptive feedback fuzzy sliding mode controller is used to compensate for residual errors. A systolic top-down hardware design methodology takes full advantage of the neural networks' inherent parallelism that allows the controller to operate at high frequencies.

Recently a number of streaming algorithms have been proposed using crisp algorithms such as hard c means or its variants. The crisp cases may not be easily generalized to fuzzy cases as these two groups of algorithms try to optimize different objective functions. In this paper we propose a streaming variant of the fuzzy c means algorithm. At any stage during processing, a good streaming algorithm should be able to summarize data seen so far and also respond to evolving distributions. We study the tradeoff involved between summarization of data seen and response to an evolving distribution by varying the amount of history used by a streaming algorithm. Empirical evaluation of the performance of our algorithm using both artificial and real data sets under a noisy setting shows its effectiveness.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413710.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"365","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy c means variant for clustering evolving data streams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","History","Fuzzy sets","Statistical distributions","Telephony","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy c means variant","data streams","data sets","crisp algorithms","hard c means","objective functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy c means variant for clustering evolving data streams","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413710/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848173","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy c means variant for clustering evolving data streams","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053765S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4413718,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The Radon transform can capture the directional features of the pattern image by projecting the pattern onto different orientation slices. The combination of the 2-D shift invariant wavelet transform with the Fourier transform can extract features that are invariant to rotation of the patterns. Standard normalization techniques are used to normalize the input pattern image so that it is translation and scale invariant. Experiments conducted in this paper show that the proposed descriptor achieves high recognition rates for different combinations of rotation angles and noise levels. The descriptor is very robust to Gaussian white noise even when the noise level is very high.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413718.pdf","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1025","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Extraction Using Radon, Wavelet and Fourier Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Fourier transforms","Wavelet transforms","Pattern recognition","Noise level","Discrete transforms","Noise robustness","White noise","Computational complexity","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Fourier transforms","Radon transforms","wavelet transforms","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Radon transform","wavelet transform","Fourier transform","invariant pattern recognition","Gaussian white noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radon transform","wavelet transform","Fourier transform","feature extraction","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Feature Extraction Using Radon, Wavelet and Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413718/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848181","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Extraction Using Radon, Wavelet and Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089474S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4413726,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Zhao Wang","affiliation":["Machine Learning Center, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, China"],"lastName":"Xi-Zhao Wang","id":"37085967261"},{"name":"Jian-Hui Yan","affiliation":["Machine Learning Center, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, China"],"lastName":"Jian-Hui Yan","id":"37088193802"},{"name":"Ran Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Beijing forestry University, China"],"lastName":"Ran Wang","id":"37087191900"},{"name":"Chun-Ru Dong","affiliation":["Machine Learning Center, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, China"],"lastName":"Chun-Ru Dong","id":"37087357428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413726","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Algorithm design and analysis","Machine learning algorithms","Testing","Iterative algorithms","Learning systems","Machine learning","Entropy","Classification tree analysis","Cellular neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","fuzzy set theory","maximum entropy methods","pattern classification","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample selection algorithm","fuzzy decision tree induction","classifier","maximum entropy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413726","abstract":"The generalization capability of a classifier will probably be degenerated when the classifier is generated from a dataset containing redundancy.

Then, the number and parameters of hidden neurons in the FNNDC are determined by means of a fuzzy c-means clustering strategy. Finally, an algorithm for immune-clone evolution (ICE) is combined with a self-adaptive mutation rate to optimize the connecting weights of the FNNDC. This method features global optimization and high precision in local searches. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of this method and its superiority over genetic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413733","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413733.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"89","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter optimization of fuzzy-neural-network decoupling controller for adjusting temperatures of regenerative reheating furnace","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Parameter optimization of fuzzy-neural-network decoupling controller for adjusting temperatures of regenerative reheating furnace","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9848196","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4413733/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter optimization of fuzzy-neural-network decoupling controller for adjusting temperatures of regenerative reheating furnace","confLoc":"Montreal, Que.","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047534S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4413741,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yoneyama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yoneyama","id":"37375036800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413741","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"abstract":"This paper is concerned with sampled-data stabilization for fuzzy systems. A new approach to sampled-data control is introduced. The system is modelled as a continuous-time fuzzy system, while the control input has a piecewise-conthmous delay. Sufficient stability conditions for the closed-loop system with a sampled- data state feedback controller are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities(LMls). We derive such stability conditions via descriptor approach to fuzzy time-delay systems under the assumption that sampling-time is not greater than some prescribed number. As such a prescribed number goes to zero, our stability conditions coincide with sufficient stability conditions for continuous- time state feedback stabilization for fuzzy systems. We also propose a design method of sampled-data state feedback controller for fuzzy systems. A numerical example is given to illustrate our sampled-data state feedback control.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Delay systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","continuous time systems","control system synthesis","delay systems","fuzzy control","fuzzy systems","linear matrix inequalities","sampled data systems","stability","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample-data stabilization","continuous-time fuzzy systems","input delay","sampled-data state feedback controller design","closed-loop system","linear matrix inequalities","LMl","stability conditions","descriptor approach","fuzzy time-delay systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems","sampled-data control","time-delay systems","delay-dependent conditions","linear matrix inequality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413741","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413741.pdf","startPage":"835","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample-data stabilization of fuzzy systems with input delay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sample-data stabilization of fuzzy systems with input delay","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413741/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413741/","accessionNumber":"9848204","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample-data stabilization of fuzzy systems with input delay","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078821S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4413755,"authors":[{"name":"Thongam Khelchandra","affiliation":["Information Systems Department, University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"lastName":"Thongam Khelchandra","id":"37088193082"},{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Information Systems Department, University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"lastName":"Jie Huang","id":"37087168801"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413755","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"abstract":"This paper presents a new technique of path planning in synthetic 3D environment.

However, many ensemble training algorithms sometimes create a very large MCS which is combined by many individual classifiers. A large MCS not only consumes computational resources but also decreases the effectiveness. One of the solutions is the pruning method. It reduces the number of individual classifiers inside an MCS that maintains the performance well or is just slightly worse than the original one. In this paper, a new pruning method, called NNEPSM, for Neural Network ensemble based on a sensitivity measure is proposed. The classifiers which have less impact to the final output of MCS will be removed. The advantages of this method include efficient performance, low-complexity and independence on training method. NNEPSM has been applied in Web applications and other benchmark dataset. The experimental results showed that our approach performs well using different datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413821","startPage":"3051","endPage":"3056","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413821.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network ensemble pruning using sensitivity measure in web applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","History","Bagging","Boosting","Computer science","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Information filtering","Information filters","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network ensemble pruning","sensitivity measure","Web application","multiple classifier systems","ensemble training algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural network ensemble pruning using sensitivity measure in web applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4413821/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848283","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network ensemble pruning using sensitivity measure in web applications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062073S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4413828,"authors":[{"name":"Shinichi Shirakawa","affiliation":["Department of Information Media and Environment, Graduate School of Environment and Information Sciences, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Shinichi Shirakawa","id":"37605835800"},{"name":"Tomoharu Nagao","affiliation":["Department of Information Media and Environment, Graduate School of Environment and Information Sciences, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Tomoharu Nagao","id":"38343994500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413828","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"abstract":"In this paper, we apply graph structured program evolution (GRAPE) to evolution of general sorting algorithm.

this paper, we experimentally implement and validate distributed consensus algorithms on a mobile actuator and sensor network platform under directed, possibly switching interaction topologies to explore issues and challenges in distributed multi-vehicle cooperative control. Distributed consensus algorithms are applied to three target applications namely rendezvous, axial alignment, and formation maneuvering. In the rendezvous application, multiple mobile robots simultaneously arrive at a common a priori unknown target location determined through team negotiation. In the axial alignment application, multiple mobile robots collectively align their final positions along a line. In the formation maneuvering application, multiple mobile robots form a rigid geometric shape and maneuver as a group with a given group velocity. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the consensus algorithms even in the presence of platform physical limitations, packet loss, information delay, etc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4413882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9848344","htmlLink":"/document/4413882/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Experimental implementation and validation of consensus algorithms on a mobile actuator and sensor network platform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental implementation and validation of consensus algorithms on a mobile actuator and sensor network platform","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057103S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4413882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4413930,"authors":[{"name":"Wan-Yu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Measurement and Control, Harbin Institute of Technology, 150001, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087505285"},{"name":"Kai Xie","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Measurement and Control, Harbin Institute of Technology, 150001, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Xie","id":"37087506942"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4413930","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4413930","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Calibration","Neural networks","Optimization methods","Genetic algorithms","Lenses","Machine vision","Inspection","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","calibration","cameras","genetic algorithms","image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera calibration method","neural network","genetic algorithm","vision inspection system","neurocalibration approach","BP neural network","two dimensional image"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413930","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04413930.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2748","endPage":"2753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A camera calibration method based on neural network optimized by genetic algorithm","abstract":"The calibration of camera is to determine the relation between the two dimensional (2D) image coordinates and the corresponding three dimensional (3D) world points, and is the basis of vision inspection system.

Inspired by Pareto optimum and NSGA-II, the developed MOGA can deal the path planning with multi-objective optimization such as: minimum energy consumption, safest and shortest length of the paths, etc. To utilize the prior knowledge, the process of initialization and mutation are controlled by different rules. The effectiveness of the prior knowledge based MOGA is demonstrated by simulation studies.

The result of operational experiments using illuminance sensors that were preset to the target illuminance showed that the brightness at specified locations approached the target illuminance that the illuminance sensors were set to.

The proposed system was used for enhancing standing balance and gait performance for amputees. In this pilot study, we hypothesized that the static balance with single limb support and gait performance during treadmill walking could be improved by providing proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation using sub-sensory stimulation and visual-auditory biofeedback in amputee respectively. To test this hypothesis, five unilateral trans-tibial amputees who consecutively wore prosthetics over two years were recruited. Experimental results show that reduction in all of the postural sway indices and increase in single leg support time index during single leg quiet standing by applying sub-sensory stimulation. With visual-auditory biofeedback for providing clue for heel contact and toe push off condition during treadmill ambulation, the improvement of all four dynamic gait performance indices in amputees was verified. These findings suggest that proposed system with sub-sensory electrical stimulation and visual-auditory biofeedback mechanisms may be effective in compensating sensory loss and improving posture control for amputees.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4414064/","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848524","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Balance control enhancement using sub-sensory stimulation and visual-auditory biofeedback strategies for amputee subjects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balance control enhancement using sub-sensory stimulation and visual-auditory biofeedback strategies for amputee subjects","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056997S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4414064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4414106,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Production Systems Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan"],"lastName":"Zhong Zhang","id":"37087172024"},{"name":"Takuma Akiduki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Production Systems Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"lastName":"Takuma Akiduki","id":"37087674579"},{"name":"Takashi Imamura","affiliation":["Department of Production Systems Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan"],"lastName":"Takashi Imamura","id":"37087306378"},{"name":"Tetsuo Miyake","affiliation":["Department of Production Systems Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan"],"lastName":"Tetsuo Miyake","id":"37087305206"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0990-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0991-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4414106","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Cellular neural networks","Design methodology","Piecewise linear techniques","Computer simulation","Guidelines","Inspection","Production systems","Systems engineering and theory","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","content-addressable storage","piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivalued associative memory realization","cellular neural network","linear combination","piecewise linear functions","linear-slope range","computer simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4414106","abstract":"In this paper, a design and implementation method of cellular neural networks with a multi-valued saturation function is discussed.

In PSO, the system (swarm) is initialized with a population of random solutions (particles) and searches for optima using cognitive and social factors by updating generations. PSO has been successfully applied to a wide range of applications, mainly in solving continuous nonlinear optimization problems. Based on the PSO and chaos theories, this paper discusses the use of a chaotic PSO approach hybridized with an implicit filtering (IF) technique to optimize performance of economic dispatch problems. The chaotic PSO with chaos sequences is the global optimizer and the IF is used to fine-tune the chaotic PSO run in sequential manner. The hybrid methodology is validated for a test system consisting of 13 thermal units whose incremental fuel cost function takes into account the valve-point loading effects.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4414152","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04414152.pdf","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1968","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4414152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic dispatch optimization using hybrid chaotic particle swarm optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Economic dispatch optimization using hybrid chaotic particle swarm optimizer","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9848612","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4414152/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic dispatch optimization using hybrid chaotic particle swarm optimizer","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085038S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4414152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4414191,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Biological nanomachines are nano- and micro-scale devices that either exist in the biological world or are artificially created from biological materials and that perform simple functions such as sensing, logic, and actuation. Molecular communication provides a mechanism for biological nanomachines to communicate information by propagating molecules that represent the information. Molecular communication is based on observations of existing biological systems which use molecules as communication carriers. With the advancement of current research in areas such as synthetic biology and bio-nanotechnologies, it may become relatively easy in the near future to develop systems of biological nanomachines communicating through molecules. In this paper, we present a framework for describing molecular communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4414237","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4413560/4413561/04414237.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4414237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4413561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interfacing with nanomachines through molecular communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4414237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414237/","displayDocTitle":"Interfacing with nanomachines through molecular communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848697","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4414237/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interfacing with nanomachines through molecular communication","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192007-00676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060177S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4413560","isNumber":"4413561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4413560","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4413561","articleId":"4414237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4414280,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Sawada","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Sawada","id":"37274767900"},{"name":"Shoko Araki","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoko","lastName":"Araki","id":"37274774900"},{"name":"Shoji Makino","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Makino","id":"37277149100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1565-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1566-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"4414280","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Blind source separation","Speech analysis","Independent component analysis","Fourier transforms","Source separation","Sampling methods","Conferences","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","blind source separation","frequency-domain analysis","independent component analysis","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain approach","blind source separation","speech/audio signals","short-time Fourier transforms","convolutive mixtures","complex-valued independent component analysis","permutation alignment method","frequency bin- wise separated signals","MLSP 2007 Data Analysis Competition"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the frequency-domain approach to the blind source separation of speech/audio signals that are convolutively mixed in a real room environment.

We employ complex-valued independent component analysis (ICA) to separate the mixtures in each frequency bin.

The log spectra of the sources are estimated from the mixture's log spectrum using minimum mean square error (MMSE) approach. The estimation is obtained from the assumption that the sources are modelled using a set of Gaussian subsources which are related to the mixture using MIXMAX approximation. The resulting estimator has a closed form and is expressed using the mean and variance of Gaussian subsources. In order to obtain the two most likely subsources which generate the mixture, we use the estimation-detection technique. We also show that the binary mask filtering which has been empirically - and with no mathematical justification - used in speech separation techniques is, in fact, a simplified form of the MMSE estimator. The proposed technique is compared with the binary mask when the input consists of male-male, female-female, and female-male mixtures. The experimental results in terms of segmental SNR show that the MMSE estimator outperforms binary mask filtering.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mean square error methods","Estimation error","Filtering","Source separation","Filters","Speech processing","Systems engineering and theory","Speech coding","State estimation","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","Gaussian processes","least mean squares methods","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single channel speech separation","minimum mean square error estimation","source log spectra","linear mixture","Gaussian subsources","MIXMAX approximation","estimation-detection technique","binary mask filtering","segmental SNR"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4414265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414294","startPage":"128","endPage":"132","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4414264/4414265/04414294.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Channel Speech Separation using Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation of Sources' Log Spectra","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single Channel Speech Separation using Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation of Sources' Log Spectra","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9946348","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4414294/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Channel Speech Separation using Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation of Sources' Log Spectra","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"MLSP-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078088S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4414264","isNumber":"4414265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4414264","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4414265","articleId":"4414294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4414311,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Specifically, we are interested in the estimation of fiber bundles (fiber tracking) in diffusion tensor (DT) fields acquired via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In previous work, we proposed a tracking scheme that was successfully tested with synthetic and real DT-MRI images. In this paper, a NN-based scheme for tuning-up these tracking systems is introduced and tested. This issue has been traditionally undertaken under an heuristical approach. Besides, several novel simplification schemes are developed so as to reduce the computational complexity of the Bayesian approaches for fiber tracking. The proposed procedures have been numerically evaluated. The efficient tracking of white matter fibers in the human brain will improve the diagnosis and treatment of many neuronal diseases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414311/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9825857","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4414311/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improvement of DT-MRI Processing Algorithms using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of DT-MRI Processing Algorithms using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"MLSP-00-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050945S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4414264","isNumber":"4414265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4414264","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4414265","articleId":"4414311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4414337,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo P.

The complex ESN (CESN) replaces the real connection weights for the reservoir and readout with complex numbers and the real activation functions with fully complex nonlinearities. CESNs provide much faster and simpler learning compared to other techniques in the literature since ESN does not backpropagate the errors through complex nonlinearities for training but only adapts a feedforward linear readout.

We optimize the sound quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and provide results on a noisy speech recognition task.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414345","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4414264/4414265/04414345.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4414265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind Noise Reduction using Non-Negative Sparse Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4414345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414345/","displayDocTitle":"Wind Noise Reduction using Non-Negative Sparse Coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9825890","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4414345/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind Noise Reduction using Non-Negative Sparse Coding","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"MLSP-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043001S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4414264","isNumber":"4414265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4414264","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4414265","articleId":"4414345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4414346,"authors":[{"name":"Seungju Han","affiliation":["Computational Neuro Engineering Laboratory (CNEL), Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Seungju","lastName":"Han","id":"37557692000"},{"name":"Kyu-Hwa Jeong","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory (CNEL), Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Kyu-Hwa","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37548586400"},{"name":"Jose Principe","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory (CNEL), Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Principe","id":"37267418400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1565-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1566-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"4414346","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise robustness","Entropy","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Array signal processing","Radar antennas","Sensor arrays","Antenna arrays","Radar applications","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","higher order statistics","impulse noise","minimum entropy methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum output entropy beamformer","robust adaptive beamforming","alpha-stable noise","nonGaussian noise","least mean p-norm","impulsive noise","MOE algorithm","higher-order statistics","M-eatimator property"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of adaptive beamforming in \u03b1-stable (non-Gaussian) noise using the constrained minimum output entropy (MOE) based algorithm.

The model captures both the economic and physical aspects of the pricing process, considering two sources of uncertainty: availability of the units and demand. This work is based on three oligopoly models-Bertrand, Cournot, and supply function equilibrium (SFE) due to Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen-and obtains closed form expressions for expected value and variance of electricity hourly prices and average price. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the number of firms, anticipated peak demand, and price elasticity of demand. The results show that as the number of firms in the market decreases, the expected values of prices increase by a significant amount. Variances for the Cournot model also increase, but the variances for the SFE model decrease, taking even smaller values than Bertrand's. Thus, if the Rudkevich model is an accurate representation of the electricity market, the results show that an introduction of competition may decrease the expected value of prices but the variances may actually increase. Finally, using a refinement of the model, it has been demonstrated that an accurate temperature forecast can reduce significantly the prediction error of the electricity prices.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.913195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4435940/04414354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.913195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435940","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting the Mean and the Variance of Electricity Prices in Deregulated Markets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4414354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting the Mean and the Variance of Electricity Prices in Deregulated Markets","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748250","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4414354/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting the Mean and the Variance of Electricity Prices in Deregulated Markets","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs01-ruibal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087495S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4435940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4435940","articleId":"4414354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4414356,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4435940/4414356/4414356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun Wang received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.","Since 2003, he has been with the Electrical Engineering and Automation Department, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.

This paper presents a network configuration optimization approach based on the plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA), which is specially suited to large-scale distribution systems. An elegant design method of the decision variables, which describes the radial feature of the distribution network and considerably reduces the dimension of the variables in the solved model, is developed. Moreover, a detailed description on switch states further improves the efficiency of calculation. The main advantage of the proposed approach in relation to previously published random algorithms is that it does not require any external parameters such as barrier factors, crossover rate, mutation rate, etc. These parameters are hard to be effectively determined in advance and affect the searching performance of the algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to a 33-bus sample system and a large-scale real system. The best solutions of the two systems, which were published in the technical literature, have been found in shorter time than the existing random algorithms. The numerical results demonstrate well the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.913293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4435940/04414356.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.913293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435940","startPage":"119","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Network Configuration in Large Distribution Systems Using Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4414356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Network Configuration in Large Distribution Systems Using Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748256","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4414356/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Network Configuration in Large Distribution Systems Using Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs01-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07308S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4435940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4435940","articleId":"4414356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4414357,"authors":[{"name":"Anupama Balasubramanian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4463806/4414357/4414357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anupama Balasubramanian (S'02) received the B.E. degree (with honors) in electrical and electronics engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, in 2004, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her research interests include biological sensors, microelectronic-circuit analysis and design, and effects of radiation on integrated circuits, specifically designing for radiation hardness and modeling circuit-level soft errors.","Ms. Balasubramanian was the recipient of the IEEE NPSS Paul Phelps Award in 2007.

In order to capture realistic driver behavior, a dynamic driver model is implemented as a probabilistic prior, which computes the likelihood of a potential maneuver. A distribution of possible future scenarios can then be approximated using a Monte Carlo sampling. Based on this distribution, different threat measures can be computed, e.g., probability of collision or time to collision. Since the algorithm is based on the Monte Carlo sampling, it is computationally demanding, and several techniques are presented to increase performance without increasing computational load. The algorithm is intended both for online safety applications in a vehicle and for offline data analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Threat Assessment for General Road Scenes Using Monte Carlo Sampling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2007.909241","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4459084/04414362.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2007.909241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4414362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Threat Assessment for General Road Scenes Using Monte Carlo Sampling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4414362/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918411","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Threat Assessment for General Road Scenes Using Monte Carlo Sampling","sourcePdf":"09tits01-eidehall.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065836S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4459084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4459084","articleId":"4414362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4414367,"authors":[{"name":"Umesh K.

Agreement based resource management in service environment enable service provider to know customer demand in advance and allocate the required resources for the service. However, traditional resource management scheduling systems for the service model have tended to be statically configured and to be non-adaptive at runtime, and have addressed coordination across resources in a limited fashion. In this paper we present a novel resource management framework in which resources can be flexible assigned to business process tasks in an efficient and adaptive way to adjust business service capability when service requirements change. The framework also uniformly accommodates an extensible set of resource types that may be both fine-grained and abstract. In addition, it is highly configurable and extensible in terms of pluggable strategies, and supports flexible runtime adaptation to fluctuating application demand and resource availability. It thus comprises a QoS driven and potentially autonomic resource management facility.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4414426","publicationTitle":"The 2nd IEEE Asia-Pacific Service Computing Conference (APSCC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd IEEE Asia-Pacific Service Computing Conference (APSCC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4414425/4414426/04414434.pdf","doi":"10.1109/APSCC.2007.8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSCC.2007.8","startPage":"3","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Resource Management Framework for Adjusting Business Service Capability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4414434/","displayDocTitle":"Automated Resource Management Framework for Adjusting Business Service Capability","htmlLink":"/document/4414434/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9895657","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Resource Management Framework for Adjusting Business Service Capability","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"30510003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063843S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4414425","isNumber":"4414426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4414425","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4414426","articleId":"4414434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4414530,"authors":[{"name":"Changhui Yang","affiliation":["Chongqing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Changhui","lastName":"Yang","id":"38239367100"},{"name":"Jinxun Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jinxun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38241832300"},{"name":"Gang Ji","affiliation":["Chongqing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Ji","id":"38242359800"},{"name":"Youjia Fu","affiliation":["Chongqing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Youjia","lastName":"Fu","id":"38231252500"},{"name":"Xiong Hong","affiliation":["Chongqing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Hong","id":"38237622300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3065-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4414530","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4414530","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Steel","Surface morphology","Neural networks","Image segmentation","Multi-layer neural network","Corrosion","Filters","Surface cracks","Stochastic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fault diagnosis","image colour analysis","image recognition","neural nets","steel","steel industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defects recognition","steel surface image","neural networks","morphology","image recognition","RGB threshold value","BP neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DMAMH.2007.56","pdfPath":"/iel5/4414509/4414510/04414530.pdf","publicationTitle":"Second Workshop on Digital Media and its Application in Museum & Heritages (DMAMH 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Second Workshop on Digital Media and its Application in Museum & Heritages (DMAMH 2007)","startPage":"72","endPage":"77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4414510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DMAMH.2007.56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Defects in Steel Surface Image Based on Neural Networks and Morphology","abstract":"A hybrid image recognition approach based on 'Neural Networks and Morphology is presented to detect various defects in steel surface image, because signal-to-noise ratio of steel surface image is very low, and defection targets are small and their shape is irregular.

The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization, which outperforms other optimization algorithm considerably on its simple architecture and fast convergence, has previously applied to solve optimum problem. Due to the particles in the multi-dimensional space seeking the best position so quickly, it would result in the dangerous of stagnation, which would make the QPSO impossible to arrive at the global optimum. In order to overcome defects of QPSO, the improved hybrid algorithm was proposed.

Given the advantages of these two techniques, this paper proposes a novel combination of them in one system. The key feature of the proposed system, termed bit-interleaved coded OFDM with iterative decoding (BI-COFDM-ID), is the iterative processing at the receiver where information exchange is carried out between the OFDM demodulator and the channel decoder. Structure and algorithms employed at the iterative receiver of BI-COFDM-ID are described in detail. The results show that BI-COFDM-ID outperforms all the previously proposed techniques at the high signal-to-noise-ratio region and, therefore, it is attractive for applications that require high spectral efficiency and low bit-error rate.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.910986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4476461/04415036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.910986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476461","startPage":"640","endPage":"649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM With Iterative Decoding in Impulsive Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM With Iterative Decoding in Impulsive Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920745","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4415036/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Interleaved Coded OFDM With Iterative Decoding in Impulsive Noise","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd02-nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123446S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4476461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4476461","articleId":"4415036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4415037,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A new indexed-scaling method is proposed to reduce both the critical-path delay and hardware cost by employing shorter wordlength. Together with the mixed-radix multipath delay feedback structure, the proposed FFT processor can achieve very high throughput with low hardware cost. From analysis, it is shown that the proposed indexed-scaling method can save at least 11% memory utilizations compared to other state-of-the-art scaling algorithms. Also, a test chip of a 1.2 Gsample/s 2048-point FFT processor has been designed using UMC 90-nm 1P9M process with a core area of 0.97 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. The signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) performance of this test chip is over 32.7 dB to support 16-QAM modulation and the power consumption is about 117 mW at 300 MHz.

The goal is to enhance the perception in complex virtual environments deriving from haptic displays mimicking human tactile discrimination. To do this we explored a Minimally Invasive Surgery application where the tactile information are strictly limited. In fact, this promising technique suffers from some evident limitations due to the surgeon loss of tactile perception during palpation of internal organs. This is basically due to the mechanical transmission of the elongated tools used during operation. We propose to integrate an Artificial Neural Network in an electronic board capable of processing data provided by a sensorized laparoscopic tool. The capabilities of several pattern recognition techniques present in literature, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Kohonen Self-Organising Map (KSOM) are investigated. The results are compared with that obtained psychophysically on five viscoelastic materials.","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415048","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415042","displayPublicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415041/4415042/04415048.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Artificial Neural Network approach for Haptic Discrimination in Minimally Invasive Surgery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415048/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Artificial Neural Network approach for Haptic Discrimination in Minimally Invasive Surgery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4415048/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9825291","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Artificial Neural Network approach for Haptic Discrimination in Minimally Invasive Surgery","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ROMAN-00-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058077S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4415041","isNumber":"4415042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4415041","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4415042","articleId":"4415048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4415207,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Wainer","affiliation":["Interaction Laboratory Center for Robotics and Embedded Systems Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Wainer","id":"38339505300"},{"name":"David J.

We measure task performance and participants' impression of a robot's social abilities in a structured task based on the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. Our experiment compares aspects of embodiment by evaluating: (1) the difference between a physical robot and a simulated one; and (2) the effect of physical presence through a co-located robot versus a remote, tele-present robot. With a participant pool (n=21) of roboticists and non- roboticists, we were able to show that participants felt that an embodied robot w as more appealing and perceptive of the world than non-embodied robots. A larger pool of participants (n=32) also demonstrated that the embodied robot was seen as most helpful, watchful, and enjoyable when compared to a remote tele-present robot and a simulated robot.","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415207","publicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415041/4415042/04415207.pdf","startPage":"872","endPage":"877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embodiment and Human-Robot Interaction: A Task-Based Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Embodiment and Human-Robot Interaction: A Task-Based Perspective","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4415207/","accessionNumber":"9825447","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embodiment and Human-Robot Interaction: A Task-Based Perspective","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ROMAN-00-165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060991S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4415041","isNumber":"4415042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4415041","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4415042","articleId":"4415207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4415228,"authors":[{"name":"Nick Hawes","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Hawes","id":"37590842900"},{"name":"Michael Zillich","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zillich","id":"37316898200"},{"name":"Jeremy Wyatt","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Wyatt","id":"37295577100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1634-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1635-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"4415228","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Middleware","Cognitive robotics","Computer architecture","Intelligent robots","Robot sensing systems","Software tools","Human robot interaction","Content addressable storage","Computer science","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","intelligent robots","middleware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["middleware","cognitive robotics","information-processing architecture","state-of-the-art intelligent robot"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415228","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415042","publicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415041/4415042/04415228.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BALT & CAST: Middleware for Cognitive Robotics","abstract":"In this paper we present a toolkit for implementing architectures for intelligent robotic systems.

In addition, a bigroup enhancer is proposed to make a clear-cut separation of the pixels lying in-between two objects. A mean vector difference enhancer is presented to suppress the gradients of noises and also to brighten the gradients of object contours. What is more, a relative-distance-error measure is put forward to evaluate the segmentation error between the extracted and target object contours. The experimental results show that all the aforementioned techniques proposed have performed impressively. Other than for cervical smear images, these proposed techniques can also be utilized in object segmentation of other images.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.912940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.912940","startPage":"353","endPage":"366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4468809/04415261.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge Enhancement Nucleus and Cytoplast Contour Detector of Cervical Smear Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Edge Enhancement Nucleus and Cytoplast Contour Detector of Cervical Smear Images","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4415261/","accessionNumber":"9918542","pubMedId":"18348920","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415261/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Enhancement Nucleus and Cytoplast Contour Detector of Cervical Smear Images","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb02-yangmao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080268S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4468809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4468809","articleId":"4415261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4415265,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Magierowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4435989/4415265/4415265-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sebastian Magierowski received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.","He was a Researcher with the Fully Integrated Systems Hardware Laboratory (FISH Lab), where he was engaged in the development of cross-layer wireless microsystems for low-power sensor network applications.

Specifically, MOS varactor characteristics are exploited to support subharmonically pumped configurations. Such configurations require lower frequency pumping, and thus, are more accommodating to CMOS pumps for millimeter-wave applications. Closed-form expressions are derived for the optimally biased accumulation-mode MOS varactor elastance based on pumping voltage, channel doping, and gate oxide thickness. Simple design equations for the pumped figure of merit, a metric common to all small-signal paramps, are obtained, resulting in a compact means of predicting integrated circuit performance. A comparison is made between MOS-based and diode-based designs (traditional and subharmonic) for a downconverting paramp topology.

We design a general framework for the Veracity problem and invent an algorithm, called TRUTHFlNDER, which utilizes the relationships between websites and their information, i.e., a website is trustworthy if it provides many pieces of true information, and a piece of information is likely to be true if it is provided by many trustworthy websites. An iterative method is used to infer the trustworthiness of websites and the correctness of information from each other.

The bilevel programming problem is firstly transformed into a single level problem by applying Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, and then an efficient method based on the statistical genetic algorithm has been proposed for solving the single level problem with the complementarity constraints. By certain handling tech- nology, the simplified problem without the complementarity constraints can be gotten. If it is solvable then its optimal solution is a feasible solution of the original bilevel pro- gramming problem. At last, a global optimal solution of the original problem can be found among its feasible solutions. Numerical experiments on some benchmark problems show that the new algorithm can find global optimal solutions of the bilevel programming problems in a small number of fit- ness evaluations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415309/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4415309/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Global Optimization Method Based on the Statistical Genetic Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear Bilevel Programming Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Optimization Method Based on the Statistical Genetic Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear Bilevel Programming Problems","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"30720096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079385S","chronDate":"15-19 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4415275","isNumber":"4415276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4415275","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4415276","articleId":"4415309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4415315,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37693123100"},{"name":"Yuanxiang Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuanxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37292395500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3072-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3072-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4415315","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415315","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolu- tion (DE) and multi-parents crossover (MPC) are the evo- lutionary computation paradigms, all of which have shown superior performance on complex non-linear function op- timization problems.

The results of security analysis indicate that this scheme not only has a large key space but also has a very sensitivity with respect to the initial conditions of 3-order CNN and the key of DES.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2007.54","startPage":"968","endPage":"971","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415275/4415276/04415491.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2007.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical Behavior of Three-Order Cellular Neural Network with Application in Image Secure Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Chaotic communication","Cryptography","Image analysis","Paper technology","Communication system security","Space technology","Computational intelligence","Information security","Application software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamical Behavior of Three-Order Cellular Neural Network with Application in Image Secure Communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4415491/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical Behavior of Three-Order Cellular Neural Network with Application in Image Secure Communication","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"30720968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103123S","chronDate":"15-19 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4415275","isNumber":"4415276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4415275","xplore-issue":"4415276","articleId":"4415491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4415503,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwen Tian","affiliation":["Beijing Union University, China","Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jingwen","lastName":"Tian","id":"37290884900"},{"name":"Meijuan Gao","affiliation":["Beijing Union University, China","Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Meijuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289044200"},{"name":"Yanxia Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Union University, China"],"firstName":"Yanxia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089073942"},{"name":"Hao Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37715520500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3072-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3072-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4415503","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Sewage treatment","Wavelet analysis","Artificial neural networks","Chemical technology","Pattern recognition","Computational intelligence","Uncertainty","Algorithm design and analysis","Temperature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415503","abstract":"Because of the complicated interaction of the sludge compost components, it makes the compost quality evaluation system appear the non-linearity and uncertainty.

We adopt a method of reduce the number of the wavelet basic function by analysis the sparse property of sample data, and use the learning algorithm based on gradient descent to train network. We select the index of sludge compost quality and take the high temperature duration, degradation rate, nitrogen content, average oxygen concentration and maturity degree as the evaluation parameters.

The overall computation is decomposed into two distinct stages; where column processing is performed in stage-1, while row processing is performed in stage-2. Using a new data-access scheme and a novel folding technique, the computation of both the stages are performed concurrently for transposition-free implementation of 2-D DWT. The proposed design can offer nearly the same throughput rate, and requires the same or less the number of adders and multipliers as the best of the existing structures. The storage space is found to occupy most of the area in the existing 2-D DWT structures but the proposed structure does not require any on-chip or off-chip storage of input samples or storage/transposition of intermediate output. The proposed one, therefore, involves considerably less hardware complexity compared with the existing structures. Apart from that, it has less duration of cycle period in comparison to the existing structures, and has a latency of cycles while all the existing structures have latency of cycles, the filter order being small compared to the input size .","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.911801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4454058/04415524.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.911801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-Efficient Systolic-Like Modular Design for Two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415524/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Efficient Systolic-Like Modular Design for Two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform","volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9778314","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4415524/","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Efficient Systolic-Like Modular Design for Two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"55tcsii02-meher.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081893S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4454058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4454058","articleId":"4415524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4415525,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Moez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Moez","id":"37530742500"},{"name":"Mohamed I.

In this work, the terminating resistor of the gate transmission line, a main contributor to the overall DA's noise figure, is replaced with a resistive-inductive network. The proposed terminating network creates an intentional mismatch to reduce the noise contribution of the terminating network. The degraded input matching at low frequencies can be tolerated for ultra-wide-band applications as they need to operate above 3 GHz. Implemented in a 0.13 mum CMOS process, the proposed DA achieves a flat gain of 12 dB with an average noise figure of 3.3 dB over the 3- to 9.4-GHz band, the best reported noise performance for a CMOS DA in the literature.

Previous work by the authors has shown that splitting each lattice stage into cascade of subrotations results in larger stopband attenuation of filter than the conventional direct quantization. This brief extends the work further by exploiting the subrotations which yield more flexible sum of signed powers-of-two quantization. This enables us to find more possible discrete representations, and hence to reduce the quantization error. Also, an algorithm for the efficient gathering of candidate discrete coefficients is developed, based on the trellis-based searching approach. It substantially alleviates the overheads of optimization program, especially when the wordlengths and the number of nonzero digits are large. Several design examples are provided to show that the proposed structure with the candidate gathering algorithm provides improved frequency response.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","startPage":"173","endPage":"177","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.910969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.910969","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4454058/04415526.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Multiplierless Lattice QMF: Structure and Algorithm Development","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415526/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of Multiplierless Lattice QMF: Structure and Algorithm Development","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9794355","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4415526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Multiplierless Lattice QMF: Structure and Algorithm Development","sourcePdf":"55tcsii02-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057198S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4454058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4454058","articleId":"4415526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4415527,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Hune Park","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Hune","lastName":"Park","id":"37836110800"},{"name":"Kwang-Hee Choi","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang-Hee","lastName":"Choi","id":"37654054600"},{"name":"Jung-Bum Shin","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Bum","lastName":"Shin","id":"37652111700"},{"name":"Jae-Yoon Sim","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Yoon","lastName":"Sim","id":"37287288800"},{"name":"Hong-June Park","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-June","lastName":"Park","id":"37277119400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4415527","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":908},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Semiconductor device measurement","Data communication","CMOS process","Bit error rate","Universal Serial Bus","Communication cables","Area measurement","Power measurement","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","data communication","demultiplexing","error statistics","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-data-bit blind oversampling data-recovery circuit","FIFO","flrst-in first-out","universal serial bus high-speed packet data transmission","USB","de-multiplexing scheme","CMOS process","bit-error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-digital data recovery","blind oversampling","first-in first-out (FIFO)","packet data communication","single data bit","universal serial bus (USB)2.0"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415527","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.911791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.911791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4454058/04415527.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Single-Data-Bit Blind Oversampling Data-Recovery Circuit With an Add-Drop FIFO for USB2.0 High-Speed Interface","abstract":"A compact blind oversampling data-recovery circuit was implemented by using a coarse data-recovery block and an add-drop first-in first out, and it was successfully applied to the universal serial bus (USB)2.0 high-speed packet data transmission.

Although many companies have deployed working VoD services, some aspects of the VoD should still undergo further improvement in order for it to reach to the foreseen potentials. An important aspect of a VoD system is the underlying network in which it operates. According to the huge number of customers in this network, it should be carefully designed to fulfill certain performance criteria. This process should be capable of finding optimal locations for the nodes of the network as well as determining the content that should be cached in each one. While this problem is categorized in the general group of network optimization problems, its specific characteristics demand a new solution to be sought for it. In this paper, which is inspired by the successful use of fuzzy optimization in similar problems in other fields, a fuzzy objective function that is heuristically shown to minimize the communication cost in a VoD network is derived while also controlling the storage cost. Then, an iterative algorithm is proposed to find a locally optimal solution to the proposed objective function. Capitalizing on the unrepeatable tendency of the proposed algorithm, a heuristic method for picking a good solution from a bundle of solutions produced by the proposed algorithm is also suggested. This paper includes a formal statement of the problem and its mathematical analysis. In addition, different scenarios in which the proposed algorithm can be utilized are discussed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.912744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468809","startPage":"404","endPage":"420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4468809/04415531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video-on-Demand Network Design and Maintenance Using Fuzzy Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4415531/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Video-on-Demand Network Design and Maintenance Using Fuzzy Optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918516","pubMedId":"18348923","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video-on-Demand Network Design and Maintenance Using Fuzzy Optimization","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb02-abadpour.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170904S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4468809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4468809","articleId":"4415531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4415532,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Delgado","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4468809/4415532/4415532-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miguel Delgado was born in Granada, Spain, in May 1951.

In the case of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the lack of suitable training algorithms sometimes hampers these procedures due to vanishing gradient problems. This paper addresses the simultaneous training and topology optimization of RNNs using multiobjective hybrid procedures. The proposal is based on the SPEA2 and NSGA2 algorithms for making hybrid methods using the Baldwinian hybridization strategy. We also study the effects of the selection of the objectives, crossover, and mutation in the diversity during evolution.

In this paper, a compressed distributed arithmetic architecture for 2D 8times8 DCT is presented, which offers high speed and small area. The basic architecture consists of a ID row DCT followed by a transpose register array and another ID column DCT, in which an 8-input ID DCT structure only requires 15 adders to build a compressed adder matrix and no ROM is needed.

The input sequence of the inter-row and intra-row samples is reordered and the folding technique is employed to reduce the hardware cost of the 1-D architecture, which achieves the critical path of one multiplier delay and can operate at over 180 MHz under SMIC 0.18um. For an N*N image, the 2-D DWT architecture requires only 3.5 N internal buffer for 5/3 DWT and 5.5 N for 9/7 DWT with delay registers of the 1-D DWT replaced by the temporal buffer. Compared with the others, the proposed architectures can achieve the same delay constraint with less arithmetic resource and internal buffer. The design is regular and well suited for VLSI implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415535/4415536/04415608.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","doi":"10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient architecture for two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform based on lifting scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Delay","Very large scale integration","Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Two dimensional displays","Hardware","Costs","Filter bank","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","pipeline arithmetic","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D discrete wavelet transform","lifting scheme","efficient 2D line-based pipeline architecture","folding technique","1D architecture","multiplier delay","VLSI implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient architecture for two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform based on lifting scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4415608/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808282","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient architecture for two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform based on lifting scheme","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066265S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4415535","isNumber":"4415536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4415535","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4415536","articleId":"4415608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4415612,"authors":[{"name":"Xunzhang","affiliation":["Department Information Science Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China","Institute of Electronic Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xunzhang","id":"38228063000"},{"name":"Liya Ying","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Liya Ying","id":"38231752100"},{"name":"Lingling Sun","lastName":"Lingling Sun","id":"38236842700"},{"name":"Zhineng Li","lastName":"Zhineng Li","id":"38239495000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1131-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1132-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-755X"}],"articleNumber":"4415612","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415612","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Field programmable gate arrays","Chaotic communication","Digital signal processing","Mathematical model","Logistics","Circuits","Nonlinear equations","Hardware","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos generators","chaotic communication","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic model","FPGA","chaotic sequence generator","logistic model","Matlab/Simulink","Altera Quartus II","Altera DSP Builder","VHDL code generation","security communication","field programmable gate array","hardware description language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Logistic model","Chaotic sequence","FPGA","DSP Builder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415612","publicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415535/4415536/04415612.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on new implementation method of chaotic model based on FPGA","abstract":"In this paper, a novel method is adopted to design a chaotic sequence generator, which is based on logistic model and implemented in FPGA.

This technique effectively reduces the gain requirement of opamp while the conversion speed is not compromised, allowing the use of simple cascode CMOS inverters. The compensation of finite gain of the opamp is made by using customized reference voltages that is calibrated periodically. The technique has been confirmed by intensive simulations.

For disadvantage(l), in DFMOC since lots of MBs in the same slice are placed together, thus the bitrate overhead is smaller.

After employing LDPC coding for UEP transmission strategy, experiment shows DFMOC has a better error robustness while still keeps less bitrate overhead compared with traditional FMO mode: the PSNR has 1 to 2 db outperforming and the bitrate overhead keeps no more than 5% which is about a half of traditional FMO overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415751","publicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415535/4415536/04415751.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415536","startPage":"798","endPage":"801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal error protected transmission with dynamic classification in H.264/AVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unequal error protected transmission with dynamic classification in H.264/AVC","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415751/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832620","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4415751/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal error protected transmission with dynamic classification in H.264/AVC","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041182S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4415535","isNumber":"4415536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4415535","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4415536","articleId":"4415751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4415754,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-qin Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-qin Wang","id":"38242030000"},{"name":"Yong Hei","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yong Hei","id":"37666512500"},{"name":"Xuan Zhou","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xuan Zhou","id":"38240349000"},{"name":"Yu-mei Zhou","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yu-mei Zhou","id":"37067737900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1131-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1132-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-755X"}],"articleNumber":"4415754","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Gain control","OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Dynamic range","Convergence","Circuit stability","Flexible printed circuits","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","gain control","OFDM modulation","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive automatic gain control","hybrid gamma parameters","frame-based OFDM receivers","frame-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM signals","flexible gain compensation scheme","stability","AGC circuits","adaptive parameter-changing-point","programmable absolute power deviation reference"]}],"abstract":"Automatic gain control (AGC) is very essential to frame-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers, because the significant features of OFDM signals are large dynamic range and high Peak-to-Average power Ratio (PAR).

Interconnection networks of regular topologies can be designed as IP cores to reduce the well known design-productivity gap. Therefore, regular topologies are more preferred than irregular topologies. To solve the scalability problem of the NoC designs with homogeneous regular topologies, we propose a new NoC design methodology that uses heterogeneous regular topologies. We illustrate the proposed heterogeneous design methodology with a simple configurable regular interconnect topology set, which consists of three subtopologies with different network performances and silicon overheads. Evaluation of the three subtopologies reveals that subtopologies with more connections result in better network performance and more wire complexity. The contribution of the proposed heterogeneous design methodology is that it provides a flexible way to scale the interconnection networks of regular topologies according to the traffic requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415873","publicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 7th International Conference on ASIC","pdfPath":"/iel5/4415535/4415536/04415873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASIC.2007.4415873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4415536","startPage":"1293","endPage":"1296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous design methodology with configurable regular topology set for scalable Network-on-Chip designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous design methodology with configurable regular topology set for scalable Network-on-Chip designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4415873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808260","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4415873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous design methodology with configurable regular topology set for scalable Network-on-Chip designs","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040498S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4415535","isNumber":"4415536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4415535","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4415536","articleId":"4415873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4415888,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Bashirullah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Bashirullah","id":"37278346500"},{"name":"Pengfei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Pengfei Li","id":"37087399623"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1131-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1132-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-755X"}],"articleNumber":"4415888","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4415888","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","High power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Power generation","Hysteresis","Frequency synchronization","Automatic control","Medical control systems","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","delay lock loops","network topology","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency DC-DC converter","power amplifier","direct RF carrier generation","ISM band","converter topology","delay-locked loop synchronization scheme","high-frequency hysteretic controlled multiphase converters","hysteretic comparator","CMOS process","frequency 6.78 MHz","frequency 25 MHz to 70 MHz","voltage 5 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the design and implementation of a high frequency DC-DC converter to directly generate an RF carrier for inductively coupled links in the 6.78 MHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band.

Today this is often a manual task. Whenever the failure in the controlled system is not directly related to an actuator, its sources have to be tracked back through the PLC program to the corresponding sensors. This process can be very time consuming. The presented work aims at providing a means for determining this effort and to assist the diagnosis process. To do so, software quality measures are studied. The evaluation of these measures on a program shows the most complex parts and hence gives hints on possible improvements. During the calculation of the measures graphical representations of some dependency relations are derived. These can be used as an aid for the engineer in the actual diagnosis process. Two case studies illustrate the presented approach.","doi":"10.1109/EFTA.2007.4416791","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (EFTA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (EFTA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4416742/4416743/04416791.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4416743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EFTA.2007.4416791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software quality measures to determine the diagnosability of PLC applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4416791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Software quality measures to determine the diagnosability of PLC applications","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4416791/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824708","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software quality measures to determine the diagnosability of PLC applications","confLoc":"Patras, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057586S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4416742","isNumber":"4416743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4416742","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4416743","articleId":"4416791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4416884,"authors":[{"name":"Volodymyr Vasyutynskyy","affiliation":["Technical Information Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Vasyutynskyy","id":"37541099500"},{"name":"Klaus Kabitzsch","affiliation":["Technical Information Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Kabitzsch","id":"38532305300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0825-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0826-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"}],"articleNumber":"4416884","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4416884","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-term control","Sampling methods","Control systems","Open loop systems","State estimation","Networked control systems","Timing","Limit-cycles","Automation","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","closed loop systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PID control algorithm","deadband sampling","CPU utilization","networked control system","closed control loop","TrueTime Toolbox","Matlab/Simulink"]}],"abstract":"Deadband sampling is used to reduce the number of messages and CPU utilization in networked control systems.

These sensor networks will typically not remain isolated but the need of interconnecting them on the network level to enable integrated data processing will arise, thus realizing the vision of a global \"sensor Internet.\" This requires a flexible middleware layer which abstracts from the underlying, heterogeneous sensor network technologies and supports fast and simple deployment and addition of new platforms, facilitates efficient distributed query processing and combination of sensor data, provides support for sensor mobility, and enables the dynamic adaption of the system configuration during runtime with minimal (zero-programming) effort. This paper describes the global sensor networks (GSN) middleware which addresses these goals. We present GSN's conceptual model, abstractions, and architecture, and demonstrate the efficiency of the implementation through experiments with typical high-load application profiles.

The hybrid excitation is an association of permanent magnets and a wound exciter.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417204","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417204.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new structure of a switching flux synchronous polyphased machine with hybrid excitation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417204/","displayDocTitle":"A new structure of a switching flux synchronous polyphased machine with hybrid excitation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852249","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417204/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new structure of a switching flux synchronous polyphased machine with hybrid excitation","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084673S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4417217,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco D.

A novel interleaved flyback-boost converter is derived with further modifications on the interleaved flyback converter, which extends the voltage gain and reduces the voltage stress of the switch. The active-clamp circuits are employed to recycle the leakage energy. Both the main and the auxiliary switches can realize ZVT soft switching condition. The turn-off voltage spikes of the main switch are clamped by the active-clamp circuits. Due to the leakage inductance of the coupled inductors, the output diode reverse-recovery problem is alleviated dramatically. A 1 kW prototype with 40V-input-to-380V-output operating at 50 kHz switching frequency built in the lab verifies the effectiveness of the proposed converter. The efficiency of nearly 90% at full load is achieved. More than 7% efficiency improvements with active-clamp circuits are achieved compared with the case with RCD snubbers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4417255/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852296","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An isolated interleaved active-clamp ZVT flyback-boost converter with coupled inductors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An isolated interleaved active-clamp ZVT flyback-boost converter with coupled inductors","confLoc":"Aalborg","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054043S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4417283,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Roux","affiliation":["Laboratoire Plasma et Conversion d''Energie, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Roux","id":"37397512500"},{"name":"Frederic Richardeau","affiliation":["Laboratoire Plasma et Conversion d''Energie, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Richardeau","id":"38349724400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417283","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Energy storage","Diodes","Bridge circuits","Voltage","Rectifiers","Filters","Pulse width modulation inverters","Plasma stability","Variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","permanent magnet motors","PWM invertors","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC link stability","energy storage","regenerative permanent magnet synchronous drive","PWM voltage inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Regenerative power","Variable speed drive","Power cycling","DC power supply"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417283","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417283.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of DC link with reduced energy storage for regenerative synchronous drive - Analytical approach","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to present an analytical approach in order to minimize the energy storage of a DC bus composed of a source, a filter and a load to estimate the influence of all parameters (operating point, control ...) on the stability.

Despite their proven buck-boost capability, existing three-level Z-source inverters are either too costly with numerous passive LC elements needed or poor in spectral quality if the \"reduced element count\" (REC) variant is used. Instead of being constrained by the tradeoff, this paper proposes an alternative three-level Z-source topological and control combination that can produce optimal output waveform quality, while using lesser passive LC elements. Through detailed operational analysis, new operating modes of the REC Z-source inverters are identified, which when inserted appropriately to the inverter state sequence, will always produce the desired voltage transfer gain with minimized commutation count and optimized three-level switching.

Active damping is performed by means of a digital Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter. Digital filters, being well known in digital signal analysis, can easily be implemented when using digital controllers and require very low computational effort. In contrast to active damping solutions found in literature, no extra quantities except the controlled current must be sensed. This functionality is proven via experimental results. After a short introduction of the problem and an overview of solutions found in literature, the implemented fundamental procedure for active damping is described. Subsequently, the main idea of using an IIR filter for active damping, being an approximation to a derivative function, is qualified and the design procedure is presented. In this paper it is stated that with this method the sensors are minimized and that due to the approximation of the derivative function the damping performance is lower compared to solutions found in literature. However, the damping effect by using an IIR filter is proven. The use of IIR filters and the reduction of sensor effort for active damping of EMI filters with multiple passives looks promising also for other applications with a known load.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417362","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417362.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping of LCL resonance with minimum sensor effort by means of a digital infinite impulse response filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Active damping of LCL resonance with minimum sensor effort by means of a digital infinite impulse response filter","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417362/","accessionNumber":"9852403","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417362/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping of LCL resonance with minimum sensor effort by means of a digital infinite impulse response filter","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070413S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4417385,"authors":[{"name":"Patricio Cortes","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (UTFSM), Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Patricio","lastName":"Cortes","id":"37275248400"},{"name":"Jose Rodriguez","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (UTFSM), Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37279149900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417385","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1548},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Filters","Predictive control","Uninterruptible power systems","Sampling methods","Low voltage","Harmonic distortion","Voltage control","Predictive models","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","power filters","predictive control","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase inverter","output LC filter","predictive control","UPS","sinusoidal voltages","low harmonic distortion","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)","Control methods for electrical systems","Voltage Source Inverters (VSI)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417385","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-phase inverter with output LC filter using predictive control for UPS applications","abstract":"The use of an inverter with an output LC filter allows for generation of sinusoidal voltages with low harmonic distortion.

Bombardier Transportation has equipped one bogie of a prototype LRV (light rail vehicle) for the public transportation operator RNV in Mannheim with a MITRAC Energy Saver. Outstanding feature is the daily operation of the energy storage unit in daily passenger service, and this even since September 2003. The experiences are very positive. The measured traction energy saving of approximately 30% confirmed fully the former calculations. Running the energy storage device on board of a tram brings additionally following benefits: (i) a dramatic reduction of the peak power demand (ii) catenary free operation\" on several hundred meters without power supply from the catenary (iii) catenary free city center by on board storage and recharging stations. Applying the energy storage devices in Metro systems has a similar effect as in case of LRVs. However the savings distribution in the whole system will be a little bit different. Due to higher regeneration capability of metro systems the expected share of the train propulsion saving will be lower. It will be compensated by a considerable reduction of the line losses, especially for systems with low rated catenary voltages (600 V or 750 V). Very promising are energy storage applications in propulsion systems of diesel-electrical multiple units (DEMUs). These vehicles lack possibilities to use the braking energy of the train. Energy storage systems on board of DEMUs bring high fuel savings together with the corresponding emission reduction. On top of that the energy storage leads to a booster effect - extra power during acceleration from the storage, by adding the limited weight of the MITRAC Energy Saver.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417400.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417400","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy storage system with ultracaps on board of railway vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417400/","displayDocTitle":"Energy storage system with ultracaps on board of railway vehicles","htmlLink":"/document/4417400/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9852437","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy storage system with ultracaps on board of railway vehicles","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052756S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4417405,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The proposed PMSM model is a phase domain model with inductances and flux profiles computed from the JMAG-RT finite element analysis software. A 3-phase IGBT inverter drives the PMSM machine. Both models are implemented on an FPGA chip, with no VHDL coding, using the RT-LAB real-time simulation platform from Opal-RT and a Simulink blockset called Xilinx System Generator (XSG). The PMSM drive, along with an open-loop test source for the pulse width modulation, is coded for an FPGA card. The PMSM drive is completed with various encoder models (quadrature, Hall effects and resolver). The overall model compilation and simulation is entirely automated by RT-LAB. The drive is designed to run in a closed loop with a HIL-interfaced controller connected to the I/O of the real-time simulator. The PMSM drive model runs with an equivalent 10 nanosecond time step (100 MHz FPGA card) and has a latency of 300 ns (PMSM machine and inverter) with the exception of the FEA-computed inductance matrix routines which are updated in parallel on a CPU of the real-time simulator at a 40 us rate. The motor drive is directly connected to digital inputs and analog outputs with 1 microsecond settling time on the FPGA card and has a resulting total hardware-in-the-loop latency of 1.3 microseconds.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417435","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417435.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time simulation of finite-element analysis permanent magnet synchronous machine drives on a FPGA card","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Finite element methods","Magnetic analysis","Permanent magnet machines","Field programmable gate arrays","Computational modeling","Testing","Motor drives","Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","finite element analysis","machine testing","permanent magnet motors","power engineering computing","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet synchronous machine drives","FPGA card","permanent magnet synchronous motor drive","HIL testing","motor drive controllers","phase domain model","flux profiles","JMAG-RT finite element analysis software","3-phase IGBT inverter drives","FPGA chip","VHDL coding","RT-LAB real-time simulation platform","Opal-RT","Simulink blockset","Xilinx System Generator","open-loop test source","pulse width modulation","HIL-interfaced controller","inductance matrix routines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real time simulation","Permanent magnet motor","Electric drive","Finite-Element Analysis","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Real-time simulation of finite-element analysis permanent magnet synchronous machine drives on a FPGA card","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852472","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time simulation of finite-element analysis permanent magnet synchronous machine drives on a FPGA card","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061471S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4417445,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihui Yuan","affiliation":["Technical University Delft, Netherlands"],"lastName":"Zhihui Yuan","id":"37088077820"},{"name":"Sjoerd W.H. de Haan","affiliation":["Technical University Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sjoerd W.H.","lastName":"de Haan","id":"37274236300"},{"name":"Braham Ferreira","affiliation":["Technical University Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Braham","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37394179000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417445","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":740},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417445","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Distributed control","Power system reliability","Control systems","Power system harmonics","Power system control","Load flow control","Power markets","Power transmission lines","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","power control","power convertors","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FACTS component","distributed UPFC","low-power series converters","large-power converter","power exchange","transmission line","harmonic frequency","power system parameters","distributed power flow controller"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new concept for power flow control by distributed UPFC.

The main problem of unequal sharing of voltage across the series connected devices can be minimised by using active gate control techniques, snubber circuits and active clamping circuits. The aim of this paper is to present a novel hybrid voltage balancing technique which can achieve good voltage balancing with minimum number of components and minimum total losses (i.e. IGBT losses and balancing circuit losses). This technique minimises the disadvantages in present voltage balancing techniques and it consists of both an active voltage clamp circuit and an optimised passive snubber. The passive snubber capacitance is optimised to have low power losses. The proposed technique was validated by both simulation and experimental work. In simulation, two lkV/50A IGBTs were connected in series and the results showed good voltage balancing with minimum losses. The experimental work was carried out on three 3.3kV71200A IGBTs connected in series. Experimental results showed good voltage balancing across the devices and the possibility of finding an optimum capacitance. Determining of the optimum snubber capacitance is critical in the hybrid voltage balancing technique and the dependence of the optimum capacitance on load is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417500","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417500.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Novel voltage balancing technique for series connection of IGBTs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417500/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852535","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417500/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel voltage balancing technique for series connection of IGBTs","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036848S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4417501,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Deadbeat control is one method to ensure the output voltage or current matches to the references at the sampling instant, so adopting this control law to the utility interactive inverter, the response of the system is much improved with small LC filter component compared with the conventional PI control, which results in the improvement of the cost performance of the inverter.

It was reported that the deadbeat control method with FPGA based hardware controller had the very good transient response for various loads, but these reports were mainly focused on a few KW class PWM inverter system, so the high carrier frequency were adopted for evaluation. But in MW class PWM inverter system, the carrier frequency is limited up to 2 kHz range, because of the performance of the switching devices and the trade off against the efficiency of the inverter. In this condition, the controllability of the PWM inverter is not so much expected. In the proposed method, to ensure the tracking accuracy of the output voltage to the reference voltage, more than two sampled data is used while one carrier interval. The proposed method is applied to single phase system and then expanded to three phase PWM inverter system. The control characteristics of the proposed variable sampling deadbeat control were verified through simulations and experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Pulse width modulation inverters","Frequency","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Control systems","Voltage","Feedback control","Transient response","Controllability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","feedback","field programmable gate arrays","PWM invertors","sampling methods","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable sampling quasi multirate deadbeat control method","PWM inverter controllability","real time digital feedback control","FPGA","hardware controller","transient response","carrier frequency","switching devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage Source Inverters","Pulse Width Modulation","Uninterruptible Power Supply"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417529","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable sampling quasi multirate deadbeat control method for PWM Inverter in low carrier frequency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variable sampling quasi multirate deadbeat control method for PWM Inverter in low carrier frequency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417529/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417529/","accessionNumber":"9852564","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable sampling quasi multirate deadbeat control method for PWM Inverter in low carrier frequency","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059071S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4417531,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Differently from other optimization methods, the proposed approach is based on a constant-optimal slip control, and then the model of the machine is not required to evaluate the power losses, avoiding any inaccuracy due to imperfect tuning of the motor parameters. The algorithm is based on an intuitive adaptation of the well known maximum torque per ampere (MTA) control into a proper scalar control scheme able to ensure a constant-optimal slip value for efficiency optimization. The proposed control scheme is implemented using the same hardware resources as those required by conventional constant V/f or slip control implementation. An experimental evaluation has been accomplished on a 5 Hp induction motor drive in order to evaluate the efficiency improvement and dynamic response of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4417542/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852577","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Indirect Maximum Torque per Ampere control of induction motor drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indirect Maximum Torque per Ampere control of induction motor drives","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053372S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4417545,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

Single stage topologies seem to be a rather attractive solution, for these applications, since in generally they are characterised by high efficiency, low cost and simple structure with high reliability due to reduced components count. On the other hand in single-phase AC-PV Module inverters, the power that is transferred to the power network has a large amount of power pulsation at twice line frequency. So a large ripple of voltage and current appears at the PV module output. Taking into account that there is a close correspondence between the power that flows from a PV module and the point of operation, this fact leads to reduced PV power generation. In order to overcome this defect, this paper presents a novel current pulsation smoothing parallel active filter (CPS-PAF) which is independent from the inverter topology and his operation mode. Purpose of the proposed CPS-PAF is the elimination of the low frequency PV current ripple. So the PV module can be operated close enough to the maximum power point and consequently the PV generated electricity power is maximised. The CPS-PAF conception, control and effectiveness are validated by PSpice simulation and experimental results accomplished on a laboratory prototype.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel Parallel Active Filter for Current Pulsation Smoothing on single stage grid-connected AC-PV modules","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417545","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417545.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A novel Parallel Active Filter for Current Pulsation Smoothing on single stage grid-connected AC-PV modules","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417545/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852580","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Parallel Active Filter for Current Pulsation Smoothing on single stage grid-connected AC-PV modules","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063945S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4417560,"authors":[{"name":"Kamel Bouallaga","affiliation":["EPMI-SATIE, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Kamel","lastName":"Bouallaga","id":"37590625800"},{"name":"Lahoucine Idkhajine","affiliation":["SATIE, Cergy-Pontoise University, Neuville-sur-Oise, France"],"firstName":"Lahoucine","lastName":"Idkhajine","id":"37394147300"},{"name":"Antonio Prata","affiliation":["Hispano-Suiza Electronic Division, Moissy Cramayel, France"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Prata","id":"37869060300"},{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["SATIE, Cergy-Pontoise University, Neuville-sur-Oise, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Monmasson","id":"37294192700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417560","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":549},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Signal resolution","Field programmable gate arrays","Analog-digital conversion","Voltage","Aerospace electronics","Stator windings","System-on-a-chip","Field programmable analog arrays","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","demodulation","field programmable gate arrays","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based system","resolver signals treatment","navigation dynamics","synchronous demodulation methods","system on a chip","SoC solution","analog to digital converter","field programmable gate array","Actel Company"]}],"abstract":"Their importance and reliability make resolvers key building blocks in flight control and navigation dynamics.

For this purpose a real time simulation of the load of the electric drive train was implemented and allows applying dynamic drive cycles, hence representing a realistic load situation of the HEPS. The test platform can be used for Hardware In the Loop (HIL) simulations of HEPS and with their power converters (in particular DC/DC converters) managing the power flow between the different power sources of the HEPS and the electric drive train. In this way the power flow in the HEPS can be optimized in function of performance and efficiency. Further the test platform can be used for the development of dedicated power converters and rapid prototyping of the associated controllers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417578.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test platform for hybrid electric power systems: Development of a HIL test platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System testing","Load flow","Road vehicles","Power system simulation","Vehicle dynamics","Hardware","DC-DC power converters","Energy management","Management training","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid electric vehicles","load flow","power convertors","railway electrification","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid electric power systems","HIL test platform","hybrid electric road vehicles","power flow","real time simulation","electric drive train","realistic load situation","hardware in the loop","power converters","dynamic drive cycles","HEPS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Test bench","Real time simulation","Hybrid electric vehicle","Power management","Simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Test platform for hybrid electric power systems: Development of a HIL test platform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417578/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852613","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test platform for hybrid electric power systems: Development of a HIL test platform","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06086S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4417587,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

Two essential parts of DVR control are how to detect the voltage disturbance such as voltage sag and how to compensate it as fast as possible respectively. The new voltage disturbance detector was implemented by using the delta rule of the neural network control. Through the proposed method, we can instantaneously track the amplitude of each phase voltage under the severe unbalanced voltage conditions. Compared to the conventional synchronous reference frame method, the proposed one shows the minimum time delay to determine the instance of the voltage disturbance event. Also a modified d-q transformed voltage regulator for single phase inverter was adopted to obtain the fast dynamic response and the robustness, where three independent single phase inverters are controlled by using the amplitude of source voltage obtained by neural network controller. By using the proposed voltage regulator, the voltage disturbance such as voltage sag can be compensated quickly to the nominal voltage level. The proposed disturbance detector and the voltage regulator were applied to the high power DVR (1000 kV A@440 V) that was developed for the application of semiconductor manufacture plant. The performances of the proposed DVR control were verified through computer simulation and experimental results. Finally, conclusions are given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417587/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417587/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852622","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Neural network controlled voltage disturbance detector and output voltage regulator for Dynamic Voltage Restorer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network controlled voltage disturbance detector and output voltage regulator for Dynamic Voltage Restorer","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038476S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4417594,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Cobreces","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Spain"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Cobreces","id":"37270949200"},{"name":"Emilio Bueno","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Spain"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Bueno","id":"37270955400"},{"name":"Francisco J.

A simple and computationally efficient control scheme is proposed for this purpose.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417617","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417617.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant hybrid four-leg multilevel converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant hybrid four-leg multilevel converter","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417617/","accessionNumber":"9852652","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417617/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant hybrid four-leg multilevel converter","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.170045S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4417623,"authors":[{"name":"Jorg Janning","affiliation":["Converteam GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Janning","id":"37327331500"},{"name":"Jean-Charles Mercier","affiliation":["Converteam Motors SA, Champigneulles, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Charles","lastName":"Mercier","id":"37680209600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417623","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":610},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medium voltage","Harmonic distortion","Filters","Topology","Induction motors","Couplings","Drives","Constraint optimization","Pulse inverters","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressors","induction motor drives","invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium voltage three-level inverter","modern gas compressor systems","high speed induction motor","drive system","high speed motor","harmonic distortions","inverter topologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High speed drives","Multilevel converters","Induction motor","Modulation strategy","Industrial application"]}],"abstract":"Key component of modern gas compressor systems in the megawatt range is the high speed induction motor fed by a medium voltage inverter. The high speed motor can be directly coupled with the compressor without needing a gearbox. This makes the compressor system more reliable and efficient. For the design of this drive system it is mandatory to follow the requirements of the high speed motor regarding harmonic distortions. The paper outlines the impact of harmonic distortions on the high speed motor. Different inverter topologies are discussed. The three-level NPC inverter with a reasonable output filter can be optimized to meet the motor requirements while also considering the constraints of the inverter. Different filter topologies combined with optimized pulse patterns are described and the harmonic distortions of the motor and the losses of the inverter are determined. The optimization shows that in many cases just an output choke in series to the motor is sufficient as a filter to meet the requirements, if the pulse pattern is optimized accordingly. Applying press pack IGBTs the three-level inverter is well fitting for the higher power range of gas compressor systems.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417623","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medium voltage three-level inverter for high speed applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417623/","displayDocTitle":"Medium voltage three-level inverter for high speed applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852658","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417623/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium voltage three-level inverter for high speed applications","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046014S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4417639,"authors":[{"name":"Jee-hoon Jung","affiliation":["Digital Printing Division, SAMSUNG Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jee-hoon Jung","id":"37279660600"},{"name":"Joong-gi Kwon","affiliation":["Digital Printing Division, SAMSUNG Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joong-gi Kwon","id":"37850782300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417639","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3955},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Rectifiers","Cost function","Frequency conversion","Zero voltage switching","Zero current switching","Diodes","Inductance","Power harmonic filters","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal design","LLC resonant converter","MOSFET","diode rectifiers","power transformer","first harmonic approximation","FHA method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power supply","Resonant converter","ZVS converters","Soft switching"]}],"abstract":"A LLC resonant topology is analyzed to derive efficiency and cost optimal design for wide input ranges and load variations. In the LLC converter, a wide range of output power is controlled with only a narrow variation in operating frequency since this converter is capable of both step-up and step-down. In addition, ZVS turn-on and ZCS turn-off of MOSFETs and diode rectifiers can be achieved over the entire operating range. Finally, the inductance of a resonant tank in the primary side can be merged in the main power transformer by resonant inductance and the absence of the secondary filter inductor makes low voltage stress on secondary rectifier and cost-effective property. DC characteristics and input-output response in frequency domain are obtained with the equivalent circuit derived by first harmonic approximation (FHA) method. In addition, operational principles are explained to show the ZVS and ZCS conditions of primary switches and output diode rectifiers, respectively.

Photovoltaic generation systems need maximum power point tracker because the PV power output depends on the operating terminal voltage and current. Further, the PV array exhibits two or more MPP's under partial shading condition and hence finding the MPP using conventional techniques is a difficult task. To overcome the difficulty, finding the MPP, the authors have proposed a novel MPPT algorithm by introducing Particle Swarm Optimization technique. Further, the proposed algorithm uses only one pair of sensors to control multiple PV arrays. This results in lower cost, higher overall efficiency and also the algorithm is simple. Proposed MPPT algorithm is verified through experimental studies. Several partial shading conditions were tested and in all these cases the algorithm takes about one second to reach the global MPP. The reachability to MPP is good in both shading and unshading.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417640.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel maximum power point tracker controlling several converters connected to photovoltaic arrays with particle swarm optimization technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle tracking","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Particle swarm optimization","Power generation","Optimal control","Control systems","Voltage","Sensor arrays","Renewable energy resources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","particle swarm optimisation","photovoltaic power systems","power convertors","power generation control","solar cell arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point tracking control","photovoltaic arrays","particle swarm optimization technique","photovoltaic generator control","partial shading condition","MPPT algorithm","multiple PV arrays","power converters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photovoltaic","Converter control","Power conditioning","Optimal control","Renewable energy systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel maximum power point tracker controlling several converters connected to photovoltaic arrays with particle swarm optimization technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417640/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852675","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel maximum power point tracker controlling several converters connected to photovoltaic arrays with particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071934S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4417645,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It permits to reduce the weight and the size of the system and improves the global life cycle cost of the vehicle. The proposed multilevel converter consists of sixteen bidirectional direct current converters (cycloconverters) connected in series to the catenary 15 kV, 16.7 Hz through a choke inductor.

It is shown that by proper modelling of the induction machine it is possible to detect the effect of the different faults on the machine current and vibrations. This paper proposes a model based on permeance network method (PNM) for the simulation of faulty induction machines. The PNM allows the authors to take into account the local magnetic saturation and remains moderately time consuming compared to the finite element method. The developed permeance network of the machine is coupled to the stator phase electrical equations on one side and, on the other side, to the mechanical motion equation in order to simulate variable speed operations. The air-gap eccentricity is then taken into account in the modelling of the air-gap permeance. The effect of the eccentricity on the current and vibration signatures is discussed. Theoretical analysis for the effect of the machine eccentricity is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852697","htmlLink":"/document/4417662/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Induction machine modelling using Permeance Network Method for dynamic simulation of air-gap eccentricity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induction machine modelling using Permeance Network Method for dynamic simulation of air-gap eccentricity","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076449S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4417663,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoyasu Nunokawa","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"lastName":"Tomoyasu Nunokawa","id":"37087571333"},{"name":"Takaharu Takeshita","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"lastName":"Takaharu Takeshita","id":"37087530381"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417663","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Matrix converters","Power harmonic filters","Voltage","Switches","Power system harmonics","Equivalent circuits","Motion control","Control systems","Bidirectional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","harmonics suppression","matrix convertors","power conversion harmonics","power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonance suppression control","three-phase to three-phase matrix converters","harmonic power","AC-AC converter","power filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matrix converter","AC/AC converter","Harmonics","Three-phase system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonance suppression control in complex frame for three-phase to three-phase matrix converters","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417663","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417663.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417663","abstract":"This paper presents a control scheme of matrix converters for suppressing the resonance of the input filter.

Depending on the stray inductances of the inductive components the power drawn by the clamping circuit can be up to 5-10% of the converter's transferred power. This paper describes methods to recover the energy of the clamping circuit (sometimes called \"active clamping\") and to feed it directly into the converter's secondary side. These methods are shown for the current fed full bridge converter and the boost converter with autotransformer. The operating behaviour of the clamping circuits is shown and analysed. Also the semiconductor losses of the switches in the clamping circuit are derived for both converters. The general operating behaviour and the analysis is verified by simulation results and by practical results of two laboratory setups with a rated power of 20 kW. Practical issues of the clamping circuit like the non-ideal reverse recovery behaviour of the MOSFET's body-diode are also covered in this paper.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","DC-DC power converters","Fuel cells","Inverters","Bridge circuits","Power system protection","Surge protection","Feeds","Switching circuits","Power semiconductor switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autotransformers","DC-DC power convertors","fuel cells","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-fed dc/dc converters","clamping energy recovery","fuel cell inverter systems","current-fed full bridge converters","boost converters","autotransformer","medium power fuel cell systems","stray inductances","inductive components","clamping circuit","switches semiconductor losses","nonideal reverse recovery","MOSFET"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Renewable energy systems","Fuel cell system","Three-phase system","High frequency power converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417676","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417676.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clamping for current-fed de/dc converters with recovery of clamping energy in fuel cell inverter systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clamping for current-fed de/dc converters with recovery of clamping energy in fuel cell inverter systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417676/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417676/","accessionNumber":"9852711","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clamping for current-fed de/dc converters with recovery of clamping energy in fuel cell inverter systems","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049886S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4417709,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To enhance high conversion efficiency together with high reliability and cost reduction, the document addresses the use of a power architecture whose front-end is a three-level half-bridge converter non standard NPC configuration. Thanks to a structured control methodology based on the possibility to use either a two-level or a three-level modulation strategy according to the input voltage level, it is possible to optimize the converter performance over the whole input voltage range. First, the soft-switching implementation of the converter which allows ZVS operation in the entire load range by using the magnetizing inductance of the transformer is discussed. Then, the operation of the converter at both two-level and three-level operation is addressed. Concluding, experimental results obtained in the specified input voltage range are presented to confirm the validity of the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417709","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417709.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide input voltage range compensation in DC/DC resonant architectures for on-board traction power supplies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417709/","displayDocTitle":"Wide input voltage range compensation in DC/DC resonant architectures for on-board traction power supplies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9852744","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417709/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide input voltage range compensation in DC/DC resonant architectures for on-board traction power supplies","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052324S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4417716,"authors":[{"name":"Josep Pou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Pou","id":"37274427400"},{"name":"Eider Robles","affiliation":["Energy Unit Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico, ROBOTIKER TECNALIA Technologic Corporation, Basque, Spain"],"firstName":"Eider","lastName":"Robles","id":"37294042000"},{"name":"Salvador Ceballos","affiliation":["Energy Unit Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico, ROBOTIKER TECNALIA Technologic Corporation, Basque, Spain"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Ceballos","id":"37293931400"},{"name":"Jordi Zaragoza","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Zaragoza","id":"37294161600"},{"name":"Antoni Arias","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Antoni","lastName":"Arias","id":"37338564400"},{"name":"Pedro Ibanez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Ibanez","id":"37426170900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-92-75815-10-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4417716","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Milling machines","Voltage control","Control systems","Capacitors","Electronic mail","Uniform resource locators","Wind turbines","Detectors","Wind energy","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet generators","power convertors","power generation control","synchronous generators","voltage control","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neutral-point-clamped converters","wind mills","wind turbines","wind generator","permanent magnet machines","positive-sequence voltage detector","grid voltage vector","converter control","synchronous generators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Converter control","Modulation strategy","Multilevel converters","Renewable energy systems","Three-phase system","Wind energy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417716","abstract":"This paper analyzes back-to-back-connected neutral-point-clamped converters in wind turbine applications.

Neither an AC choke nor a DC choke is used. It is necessary to use DC-link stabilization control if the mains inductance is not very low. Conventional DC-link stabilization controllers rely on the current controller. If no input choke is used, however, the natural frequency of the DC link is higher than the current-control bandwidth, and the conventional stabilization methods cannot be used. This paper proposes a control algorithm based on direct manipulation of the stator voltage reference. Furthermore, a recently proposed field-weakening controller is modified to better suit the oscillating DC-link voltage. Design recommendations for the proposed scheme are presented. Simulation results of a 110-kW drive show that the proposed scheme stabilizes the DC link and the dynamic performance is comparable with that of the conventional drive.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2007.4417763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2007.4417763","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417196/4417197/04417763.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of induction motor drives equipped with small DC-Link capacitance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Control of induction motor drives equipped with small DC-Link capacitance","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4417763/","accessionNumber":"9852797","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417763/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of induction motor drives equipped with small DC-Link capacitance","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045691S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417196","isNumber":"4417197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417196","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4417197","articleId":"4417763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE AssociationIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4417768,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Performance and cost issues will be mentioned in order to explain why the SiC market is growing more slowly than numerous market analyses may suggest. However, it will be shown that the position of SiC in power electronics is manifested. For the further penetration of these components into applications the use of efficiency advantages given by the use of SiC components will be worked out as an important argument for justifying the higher device costs. The current version of commercially available diodes will be mentioned as well as an insight into the field of SiC power switches.

The DDSRF-PLL uses a dual synchronous reference frame and a decoupling network to effectively separate the positive- and negative-sequence voltage components in a fast and accurate way. Excellent behavior of the DDSRF-PLL is demonstrated experimentally. Once sequence components of the faulty grid voltage are properly identified several algorithms computing current references are developed. Additionally, different power delivery strategies to ride-through grid faults are discussed and simulations results are presented. As a conclusion, it will be demonstrated that certain control strategies ensure a stable operation of the front-end inverter while the grid voltage is supported by means of injection of instantaneous reactive power at the same time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Wind turbines","Phase locked loops","Power system transients","Wind power generation","Renewable energy resources","Voltage control","Wind energy","Voltage fluctuations","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase locked loops","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault ride-through capability implementation","wind turbine converters","decoupled double synchronous reference frame PLL","grid synchronization","power converters","dual synchronous reference frame","decoupling network","voltage components","faulty grid voltage","front-end inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrical energy generating systems","renewable energy systems","13a.

Such environments can be implemented using commercial multiplayer game engines together with the associated software development kits. Such immersive environments are expected to provide students with an opportunity for exercising their problem solving skills by collaboratively interacting with each other and the virtual laboratory exercises. This paper discusses the requirements for designing game-based virtual laboratory environments from pedagogical as well as technical point of view. Also, the practical implementation of these design requirements in a prototype system is discussed and a sample scenario for a virtual laboratory based on an existing laboratory exercise from a junior- level mechanical engineering course on mechanisms and machine dynamics is presented. The described virtual laboratory environment represents an attempt to mimic important aspects of the learning experience gained through conventional hands-on experiments and even augment this experience by certain features that are not achievable in the traditional hands-on laboratory setting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4417818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4417818/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9831567","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A scenario for collaborative learning in virtual engineering laboratories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scenario for collaborative learning in virtual engineering laboratories","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093737S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417794","isNumber":"4417795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417794","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4417795","articleId":"4417818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4417913,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Hashemian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Hashemian","id":"37352242100"},{"name":"Jason Riddley","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Riddley","id":"37698000300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1083-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1084-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-5848"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-634X"}],"articleNumber":"4417913","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Hardware","Internet","Remote monitoring","Buildings","System testing","Debugging","Prototypes","Laboratories","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","computerised monitoring","data acquisition","electronic engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","Internet","logic CAD","logic testing","peripheral interfaces","student experiments","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital hardware design","digital hardware testing","classroom environment","laboratory experiment","Internet","Web terminal","system debugging","e-Lab experimental unit","Xilinx SPARTAN-3E FGPA development board","National Instruments Lab View","RS232 serial port","USB port","Microsoft XP remote desktop","computerised monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electronic lab","hardware design","laboratory experiment","remote access"]}],"abstract":"A new technique is presented that allows an instructor to bring the hardware construction and the laboratory experiments into the classroom environment through the Internet.

The pace of such improvement depends on the speed with which new ideas and materials are adopted across institutions. In 1999 Microsoft pledged $25 million and staff support for iCampus, a seven-year MIT project to develop pioneering uses of educational technology. The TLT Group studied five iCampus projects in order to identify factors affecting institutionalization and widespread dissemination. Among the factors impeding adoption: lack of rewards and support for faculty to adopt innovations; faculty isolation; and a lack of attention to adoption issues among projects selected for funding. The study made recommendations for universities, foundations, government agencies and corporations: 1) continue making education more authentic, active, collaborative, and feedback-rich; 2) create demand to adopt ideas and materials from other sources by encouraging all faculty members to improve and document learning in their programs, year after year; 3) nurture coalitions for instructional improvement, across and within institutions; 4) create more effective higher education - corporate alliances; and 5) improve institutional services to support faculty in educational design, software development, assessment methods, formative evaluation, and/or in sharing ideas with others who teach comparable courses.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2007.4418031","publicationTitle":"2007 37th Annual Frontiers In Education Conference - Global Engineering: Knowledge Without Borders, Opportunities Without Passports","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 37th Annual Frontiers In Education Conference - Global Engineering: Knowledge Without Borders, Opportunities Without Passports","pdfPath":"/iel5/4417794/4417795/04418031.pdf","startPage":"T2G-18","endPage":"T2G-23","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2007.4418031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Factors affecting the adoption of faculty-developed academic software: A study of five iCampus projects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Factors affecting the adoption of faculty-developed academic software: A study of five iCampus projects","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4418031/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9831732","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factors affecting the adoption of faculty-developed academic software: A study of five iCampus projects","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262007-00236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04752S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4417794","isNumber":"4417795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4417794","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4417795","articleId":"4418031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4418131,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Minnesota State University, Mankato, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Qun Zhang","id":"37307996700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1083-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1084-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-5848"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-634X"}],"articleNumber":"4418131","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphical user interfaces","Optical computing","Optical design","Optical fiber communication","Software tools","Wavelength division multiplexing","Computer interfaces","Communication industry","Computer industry","System-level design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","electronic engineering education","graphical user interfaces","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GUI based computer modeling","interactive learning","fiber optic communications","graphical user interface","optical communications","software tool development","wavelength division multiplexing system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fiber optic communications","system design","photonic design automation","graphical user interface (GUI)","software engineering"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we explain a graphical user interface (GUI) based computer modeling and design platform that has been developed to teach students about the current industry design practice in optical communications and to promote interactive learning in our senior/graduate level fiber optic communications course.

Furthermore, the proposed method is based on the traditional parity codes to detect and correct a single-bit error without significant increase in area overhead.

Since most of the Oriya characters have curve-like stroke, we use curvature feature for the recognition purpose. To get the feature, at first, the input image is size normalized and segmented into 49times49 blocks. Curvature is then computed using bi-quadratic interpolation method and quantized into 3 levels according to concave, linear and convex regions. Next direction of gradient is quantized into 32 levels with pi/16 intervals, and strength of the gradient is accumulated in each of the 32 directions and in each of the 3 curvature levels of every block. A spatial resolution is made to get 7times7 blocks from 49times49 blocks and a directional resolution is made to get 8 directions from 32 directions. Using curvature features for 3 levels we get 1176 (7times7 blocks times 8 directions times 3 levels) dimensional features. Finally using principal component analysis we reduce the dimension 1176 to 392 and this 392 dimensional feature vector is fed to a quadratic classifier for recognition. We tested 18190 samples of Oriya handwritten samples and obtained 94.60% accuracy from our proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2007.63","startPage":"227","endPage":"229","displayPublicationTitle":"10th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418246/4418247/04418301.pdf","publicationTitle":"10th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2007.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System for Off-Line Oriya Handwritten Character Recognition Using Curvature Feature","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Shape","Handwriting recognition","Computer vision","Spatial resolution","Speech recognition","Information technology","Pattern recognition","Image segmentation","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","handwritten character recognition","image classification","interpolation","natural language processing","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offline Oriya handwritten character recognition","curvature feature","biquadratic interpolation method","principal component analysis","quadratic classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A System for Off-Line Oriya Handwritten Character Recognition Using Curvature Feature","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418301/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9896020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System for Off-Line Oriya Handwritten Character Recognition Using Curvature Feature","confLoc":"Rourkela, India","sourcePdf":"30680227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044886S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418246","isNumber":"4418247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418246","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4418247","articleId":"4418301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4418370,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

Each TDOA satisfies the equation of a hyperboloid in space and methods have been developed to either solve for intersecting hyperboloids or make some approximation to them, keeping source-location determination a nonlinear, somewhat complex problem. We introduce a closed-form, analytic solution for the problem (the GS algorithm). It is so simple that we were surprised that, until very recently, there have been no other solutions similar to ours. The method uses a minimum of five microphones in three dimensions, one more than other solutions, but, for nonsingular layouts of the microphones, it is very fast and accurate. First, the new method is compared to other closed-form methods for accuracy and sensitivity to noise using simulated data. Then, several variants of GS are compared to two other real-time algorithms, LEMSalg and SRP-PHAT, using real, human-talker data from a large array in a noisy room.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.910324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.910324","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04418389.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Linear Closed-Form Algorithm for Source Localization From Time-Differences of Arrival","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"A Linear Closed-Form Algorithm for Source Localization From Time-Differences of Arrival","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","volume":"15","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418389/","accessionNumber":"9920179","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418389/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linear Closed-Form Algorithm for Source Localization From Time-Differences of Arrival","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-gillette.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059149S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4418389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":4418399,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwu Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Hongwu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292097600"},{"name":"Ji Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Li","id":"37292373100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4418399","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Multiuser detection","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Block codes","Estimation","Genetic algorithms","Maximum likelihood detection","Fading","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","diversity reception","genetic algorithms","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection","Pareto analysis","particle swarm optimisation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization-based multiuser detection","receive-diversity-aided STBC systems","space-time block coding","independent log-likelihood function","signal estimation","multiple receive antenna-branches","Pareto optimal way","genetic algorithm","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","multiuser detection","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","space-time block coding (STBC)"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based multiuser detection (MUD) for the receive-diversity aided space-time block coding (STBC) systems.

These patterns are learnt from a set of phone lattices generated from the utterances. Just like children acquiring language, our system does not have prior information on what the meaningful patterns are. By applying the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to a fixed-length high-dimensional vector representation of the speech utterances, a decomposition in terms of additive units is obtained. We illustrate that these units correspond to words in case of a small vocabulary task. Our result also raises questions about whether explicit segmentation and clustering are needed in an unsupervised learning context.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.911723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04418411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.911723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Phone Patterns in Spoken Utterances by Non-Negative Matrix Factorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Phone Patterns in Spoken Utterances by Non-Negative Matrix Factorization","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418411/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"9920222","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4418411/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Phone Patterns in Spoken Utterances by Non-Negative Matrix Factorization","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-stouten.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043611S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4418411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4418417,"authors":[{"name":"Amr M.

Over the equivalent non-fading channel, capacity has recently been shown to be achievable using transmission schemes that were designed for the \"dirty paper\" channel. We focus on a similar \"fading paper\" model. The evaluation of the fading paper capacity is difficult to obtain. We confine ourselves to the linear-assignment capacity, which we define, and use convex analysis methods to prove that its maximizing distribution is Gaussian. We compare our fading-paper transmission to an application of dirty paper coding that ignores the partial state information and assumes the channel is fixed at the average fade. We show that a gain is easily achieved by appropriately exploiting the information. We also consider a cooperative upper bound on the sum-rate capacity as suggested by Sato. We present a numeric example that indicates that our scheme is capable of realizing much of this upper bound.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418461.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","startPage":"100","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Fading-Paper Achievable Region of the Fading MIMO Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Fading-Paper Achievable Region of the Fading MIMO Broadcast Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756573","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4418461/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Fading-Paper Achievable Region of the Fading MIMO Broadcast Channel","sourcePdf":"54tit01-bennatan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087903S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4418455","articleId":"4418461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4418462,"authors":[{"name":"Irina E.

The output of a list decoder is a list of the <emphasis><formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$L$</tex></formula></emphasis> most likely codewords, that is, the <emphasis><formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$L$</tex> </formula></emphasis> signal points closest to the received signal in the Euclidean-metric sense. A decoding error occurs when the transmitted codeword is not on this list. It is shown that the list error probability is fully described by the so-called list configuration matrix, which is the Gram matrix obtained from the signal vectors forming the list. The worst case list configuration matrix determines the minimum list distance of the code, which is a generalization of the minimum distance to the case of list decoding. Some properties of the list configuration matrix are studied and their connections to the list distance are established. These results are further exploited to obtain a new upper bound on the list error probability, which is tighter than the previously known bounds. This bound is derived by combining the techniques for obtaining the tangential union bound with an improved bound on the error probability for a given list.

Since the channel is not ergodic, Shannon's source-channel separation theorem becomes obsolete and the optimal performance requires a joint source-channel approach. Our goal is to minimize the expected end-to-end distortion, particularly in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The figure of merit is the distortion exponent, defined as the exponential decay rate of the expected distortion with increasing SNR. We provide an upper bound and lower bounds for the distortion exponent with respect to the bandwidth ratio among the channel and source bandwidths. For the lower bounds, we analyze three different strategies based on layered source coding concatenated with progressive superposition or hybrid digital/analog transmission. In each case, by adjusting the system parameters we optimize the distortion exponent as a function of the bandwidth ratio.

At least theoretically, this meets one of the central challenges in algorithmic coding theory. Our codes are simple to describe: they are folded Reed-Solomon codes, which are in fact exactly Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, but viewed as a code over a larger alphabet by careful bundling of codeword symbols. Given the ubiquity of RS codes, this is an appealing feature of our result, and in fact our methods directly yield better decoding algorithms for RS codes when errors occur in phased bursts. The alphabet size of these folded RS codes is polynomial in the block length. We are able to reduce this to a constant (depending on epsiv) using existing ideas concerning ldquolist recoveryrdquo and expander-based codes. Concatenating the folded RS codes with suitable inner codes, we get binary codes that can be efficiently decoded up to twice the radius achieved by the standard GMD decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418476.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explicit Codes Achieving List Decoding Capacity: Error-Correction With Optimal Redundancy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418476/","displayDocTitle":"Explicit Codes Achieving List Decoding Capacity: Error-Correction With Optimal Redundancy","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742866","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418476/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explicit Codes Achieving List Decoding Capacity: Error-Correction With Optimal Redundancy","sourcePdf":"54tit01-guruswami.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160287S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4418455","articleId":"4418476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4418479,"authors":[{"name":"Syed A.

The inner and outer bounds on the degrees of freedom region are tight whenever integer degrees of freedom are optimal for each message. With M = 1 antennas at each node, we find that the total (sum rate) degrees of freedom are bounded above and below as 1 les eta*x les 4/3. If M > 1 and channel matrices are nondegenerate then the precise degrees of freedom eta*x = (4/3)M. Thus, the MIMO X channel has noninteger degrees of freedom when M is not a multiple of 3. Simple zero forcing without dirty paper encoding or successive decoding, suffices to achieve the (4/3)M degrees of freedom. If the channels vary with time/frequency then the channel with single antennas (M = 1) at all nodes has exactly 4/3 degrees of freedom. The key idea for the achievability of the degrees of freedom is interference alignment-i.e., signal spaces are aligned at receivers where they constitute interference while they are separable at receivers where they are desired. We also explore the increase in degrees of freedom when some of the messages are made available to a transmitter or receiver in the manner of cognitive radio.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","startPage":"151","endPage":"170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO - Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex>$X$</tex></formula> Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756580","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex>$X$</tex></formula> Channel","sourcePdf":"54tit01-jafar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073921S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"570","articleId":"4418479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4418481,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhua Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jinhua","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37291790800"},{"name":"Yan Xin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xin","id":"37293344500"},{"name":"Hari Krishna Garg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hari Krishna","lastName":"Garg","id":"37281044200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4418481","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":359},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> In this paper, the interference channel with common information (ICC), in which two senders need deliver not only private messages but also certain common messages to their <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">corresponding</emphasis> receivers, is investigated. An achievable rate region for such a channel is obtained by applying a superposition coding scheme that consists of successive encoding and simultaneous decoding. It is shown that the derived achievable rate region includes or extends several existing results for the interference channels with or without common information. The rate region is then specialized to a class of ICCs in which one sender has no private information to transmit, and a class of deterministic interference channels with common information (DICCs). In particular, the derived rate region is found to be the capacity region for this class of DICCs. Last, the achievable rate region derived for the discrete memoryless ICC is extended to the Gaussian case, in which a numerical example is provided to illustrate the improvement of our rate region over an existing result. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Decoding","Integrated circuit modeling","Degradation","Communication networks","Silicon carbide","Additives","Acoustic materials","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","encoding","interference (signal)","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference channels","common information","private messages","achievable rate region","superposition coding scheme","successive encoding","simultaneous decoding","private information","capacity region","discrete memoryless ICC","Gaussian case","multiple access channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity region","common information","interference channel","multiple-access channel (MAC)","simultaneous decoding","superposition coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418481.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Channels With Common Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Channels With Common Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418481/","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9756582","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Channels With Common Information","sourcePdf":"54tit01-jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048746S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"40","articleId":"4418481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4418482,"authors":[{"name":"Yibo Jiang","affiliation":["Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yibo","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37558429500"},{"name":"Alexei Ashikhmin","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Alexei","lastName":"Ashikhmin","id":"37272162900"},{"name":"Ralf Koetter","affiliation":["Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Koetter","id":"37274507400"},{"name":"Andrew C.

Our primary motivation is construction of practical and portable multi-antenna configurations with a very small and a-priori fixed volume for placing antennas. Using spectral efficiency as a target metric for array optimization, we show that any array configuration, transmit or receive, can be characterized via a parameter that we interpret as \"effective degrees of freedom.\" For any array configuration, effective degrees of freedom describes an equivalent uncorrelated array, which results in the same low-power behavior of spectral efficiency. Joint optimization of transmit and receive antenna configurations decouples into maximizing effective degrees of freedom for transmitter and receiver separately. To achieve this goal, we introduce and study a theoretical benchmark of \"limiting degrees of freedom,\" which is the least upper bound on effective degrees of freedom, evaluated over all configurations with finite number of antennas. Limiting degrees of freedom therefore describes the best possible performance for any transceiver array which confines its elements inside a given space. We compute a closed-form expression for limiting degrees of freedom of a circular geometry. Finally, we present numerical procedure and examples for designing linear and square arrays with nonuniform spacing, which typically exhibit significant spectral efficiency gains over uniform arrays.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418491.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Packing in Low-Power Systems: Communication Limits and Array Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Decoding","Hamming weight","Linearity","Computer science","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","low-power electronics","MIMO communication","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna packing","low-power systems","communication limits","transceiver antenna array design","portable multiantenna configurations","array optimization","equivalent uncorrelated array","joint optimization","receive antenna configurations","closed-form expression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","multi-antenna communications","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Packing in Low-Power Systems: Communication Limits and Array Design","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4418491/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756591","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Packing in Low-Power Systems: Communication Limits and Array Design","sourcePdf":"54tit01-muharemovic-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087659S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4418455","articleId":"4418491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4418493,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Muresan","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA","University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Muresan","id":"37324462500"},{"name":"Michelle Effros","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Effros","id":"37275255700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4418493","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Histograms","Algorithm design and analysis","Decoding","Runtime","Polynomials","Shortest path problem","Data compression","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","encoding","quantisation (signal)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["histogram segmentation","optimal scalar quantizer design","network systems","discrete-alphabet sources","entropy-constrained conventional scalar quantizers","multiresolution scalar quantizers","fixed-rate scalar quantizers","multiple description scalar quantizers","Wyner-Ziv scalar quantizers","directed acyclic graph","shortest path problem","code design algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal design","multiple descriptions","multiresolution","scalar quantizer","successive refinement","Wyner\u2013Ziv"]}],"abstract":"An algorithm for scalar quantizer design on discrete-alphabet sources is proposed.

The transmitter has a long-term (time) average power constraint. There can be multiple antennas at the transmitter and at the receiver. The channel experiences Rayleigh fading. We consider beamforming and space-time coded systems with perfect/imperfect CSIT and CSIR. The performance measure is the bit error rate (BER). We show that in both coded and uncoded systems, our power allocation policy provides exponential diversity order if perfect CSIT is available. We also show that, if the quality of CSIT degrades then the exponential diversity is retained in the low SNR region but we get only polynomial diversity in the high SNR region. Another interesting conclusion is that in case of imperfect CSIT and CSIR, knowledge of CSIT at the receiver is very important. Finally, for the optimal power control policy of the uncoded system we find the error-exponents which provide the rate versus diversity-order tradeoff for this policy. This tradeoff is of an entirely different nature than the well-known Zheng-Tse tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","startPage":"188","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential Diversity Achieving Spatio\u2013Temporal Power Allocation Scheme for Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exponential Diversity Achieving Spatio\u2013Temporal Power Allocation Scheme for Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756595","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4418500/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential Diversity Achieving Spatio\u2013Temporal Power Allocation Scheme for Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit01-sharma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082421S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4418455","articleId":"4418500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4418501,"authors":[{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Oren Somekh","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Somekh","id":"38336938100"},{"name":"Yeheskel Bar-Ness","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yeheskel","lastName":"Bar-Ness","id":"38272137900"},{"name":"Umberto Spagnolini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Spagnolini","id":"37269649600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4418501","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Collaboration","Base stations","Relays","Decoding","Fading","Media Access Protocol","Time division multiple access","Frequency division multiaccess","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cellular radio","fading channels","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power cellular systems","collaborative base stations","collaborative base relaying","joint decoding","cooperative decoding","collaborative transmission","collaborative relaying","current cellular systems","fading channels","intracell orthogonal medium access control","low-power wideband regime","reliable communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular systems","cooperative transmission","mesh networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput of Low-Power Cellular Systems With Collaborative Base Stations and Relaying","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911220","startPage":"459","endPage":"467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418501.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911220","abstract":"In this correspondence, joint (cooperative) decoding at the base stations combined with collaborative transmission (relaying) is investigated as a means to improve the uplink throughput of current cellular systems over fading channels. Intracell orthogonal medium access control (e.g., TDMA, FDMA, or orthogonal CDMA) and Decode-and-Forward relaying by either a mobile terminal or a fixed relay are assumed. Moreover, the cellular system is modeled according to a simplified framework introduced by Wyner. The per-cell achievable ergodic throughput is calculated for different system configurations and then characterized in the low-power (wideband) regime in terms of minimum energy per bit required for reliable communication and slope of the spectral efficiency. The analysis allows to clearly assess the relative merits of both cooperation among base stations and at the terminal level within the considered model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418501/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9756596","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4418501/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Throughput of Low-Power Cellular Systems With Collaborative Base Stations and Relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput of Low-Power Cellular Systems With Collaborative Base Stations and Relaying","sourcePdf":"54tit01-simeone-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074936S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4418455","articleId":"4418501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4418503,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Wan Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi Wan","lastName":"Sung","id":"37265579100"},{"name":"Kenneth W.

While problems on storage required for participants, for example, the size of shares, have been well studied, problems regarding the communication complexity of the two distribution phases seem to have been mostly neglected in the literature so far. In this correspondence, we deal with several communication related problems in the secret reconstruction phase. Firstly, we show that there is a tradeoff between the communication costs and the number of participants involved in the secret reconstruction. We introduce the communication rate as the ratio of the secret size and the total number of communication bits transmitted from the participants to the combiner in the secret reconstruction phase. We derive a lower bound on the communication rate and give constructions that meet the bound. Secondly, we show that the point-to-point secure communication channels for participants to send share information to the combiner can be replaced with partial broadcast channels. We formulate partial broadcast channels as set systems and show that they are equivalent to the well-known combinatorial objects of cover-free family. Surprisingly, we find that the number of partial broadcast channels can be significantly reduced from the number of point-to-point secure channels. Precisely, in its optimal form, the number of channels can be reduced from n to O(log n), where is the number of participants in a secret sharing scheme. We also study the communication rates of partial broadcast channels for the secret reconstruction.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4418455/04418504.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"480","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.911179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.911179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Secret Reconstruction in Secret Sharing Schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"On Secret Reconstruction in Secret Sharing Schemes","htmlLink":"/document/4418504/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9756599","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Secret Reconstruction in Secret Sharing Schemes","sourcePdf":"54tit01-wang-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10382S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4418455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4418455","articleId":"4418504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4418506,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Tao Xia","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Shenzhen of Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Shu-Tao","lastName":"Xia","id":"37288202600"},{"name":"Fang-Wei Fu","affiliation":["Chern Institute of Mathematics and the Key Laboratory of Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Fang-Wei","lastName":"Fu","id":"37283990600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4418506","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418506","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Cryptography","Broadcasting","Computer science","Cost function","Communication channels","Buildings","Communication system security","Distributed computing","Cryptographic protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","linear programming","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum pseudoweight","minimum pseudocodewords","LDPC Codes","low-density parity-check codes","linear programming decoding","Tanner graph","maximum-likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fundamental cone","linear programming (LP) decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","pseudocodewords","pseudoweight","stopping sets"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we study the minimum pseudoweight and minimum pseudocodewords of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under linear programming (LP) decoding.

Then, the lower bound of Kashyap and Vardy on the stopping distance of an LDPC code is proved to be also a lower bound on the pseudoweight of a nonzero pseudocodeword of an LDPC code whose Tanner graph has girth , and this lower bound is tight if and only if this pseudocodeword is a real multiple of a codeword. Using these results we further obtain that for some LDPC codes, there are no other minimum pseudocodewords except the real multiples of minimum weight codewords. This means that the LP decoding for these LDPC codes is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the ratio of the probabilities of decoding errors of LP decoding and maximum-likelihood decoding approaches as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity.

The main goal is to perform the complete control of the electronic ballast by maintaining the switching frequency constant and without using other parameters of the power converter, such as input voltage or duty cycle. The magnetic regulator is controlled by means of a dc current, which allows performing both lamp soft starting and lamp dimming. Apart from the important advantage of keeping a constant frequency during full electronic ballast operation, the proposed method presents additional advantages when compared to other control methods, such as inherent isolated control, more linear control characteristics, constant electrode power, and higher efficiency. Experimental results from a 36-W linear fluorescent lamp prototype are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.896033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4418510/04418511.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.896033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418510","startPage":"3","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of a New Control Strategy for Electronic Ballasts Based on Variable Inductor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of a New Control Strategy for Electronic Ballasts Based on Variable Inductor","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742851","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4418511/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of a New Control Strategy for Electronic Ballasts Based on Variable Inductor","sourcePdf":"55tie01-alonso2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048337S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4418510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4418510","articleId":"4418511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4418512,"authors":[{"name":"Luis A.

Five different fuel-cell technologies are available in the research laboratories. Nevertheless, only two technologies can really be considered for transportation applications due to their solid electrolyte, i.e., proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells. The PEMFCs are investigated in this paper. When talking about EV design, a simulation model of the whole fuel-cell system is a binding milestone. This would lead in the optimization ability of the complete vehicle (including all ancillaries, output electrical converter, and their dedicated control laws). Nevertheless, the fuel-cell model is strongly dependent on many physicochemical parameters that are difficult to evaluate on a real PEMFC stack. Moreover, the analytical relations governing the behavior of a PEMFC system are also far from being easy.

The development of a fully automated web inspection system requires robust and efficient fabric defect detection algorithms. The inspection of real fabric defects is particularly challenging due to the large number of fabric defect classes, which are characterized by their vagueness and ambiguity. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect fabric defects and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and/or describe these algorithms. This paper attempts to present the first survey on fabric defect detection techniques presented in about 160 references. Categorization of fabric defect detection techniques is useful in evaluating the qualities of identified features. The characterization of real fabric surfaces using their structure and primitive set has not yet been successful. Therefore, on the basis of the nature of features from the fabric surfaces, the proposed approaches have been characterized into three categories; statistical, spectral and model-based. In order to evaluate the state-of-the-art, the limitations of several promising techniques are identified and performances are analyzed in the context of their demonstrated results and intended application. The conclusions from this paper also suggest that the combination of statistical, spectral and model-based approaches can give better results than any single approach, and is suggested for further research.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.1930.896476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4418510/04418522.pdf","startPage":"348","endPage":"363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.1930.896476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-Vision-Based Fabric Defect Detection: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418522/","displayDocTitle":"Computer-Vision-Based Fabric Defect Detection: A Survey","volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756548","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418522/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-Vision-Based Fabric Defect Detection: A Survey","sourcePdf":"55tie01-kumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173963S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4418510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"392","xplore-issue":"4418510","articleId":"4418522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":4418523,"authors":[{"name":"Yuang-Shung Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Applied Science and the Department of Electronic Engineering, FuJen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4418510/4418523/4418523-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuang-Shung Lee (M'91) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1983 and 1993, respectively.","In 1986, he joined Fu-Jen Catholic University, Taipei, as a Faculty Member, where he was the Head of the Department of Electronic Engineering from 1997 to 2000 and is currently a Full Professor with the Graduate Institute of Applied Science and Engineering and the Department of Electronic Engineering.

The algorithm is employed to tune both control points of the BMFs and the weights of the FNNs. The traditional multiple-input multiple-output FNN (MIMOFNN) cannot directly be used in this paper. The main reason is that there are too many free parameters in the MIMOFNN to be trained if many inputs are required. In this paper, a merged multiple-input single-output (MISO) FNN is proposed and can be trained by the RGA optimization approach. The merged MISO FNN with RGA (FNNRGA) can achieve faster convergence and lower estimation error than neural networks with the back propagation method. From experimental results, the proposed merged MISO FNNRGA is superior, more robust than the traditional method, and the overfitting suppression features are significantly improved.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.896496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4418510/04418523.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.896496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Computing for Battery State-of-Charge (BSOC) Estimation in Battery String Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418523/","displayDocTitle":"Soft Computing for Battery State-of-Charge (BSOC) Estimation in Battery String Systems","volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756550","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418523/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Computing for Battery State-of-Charge (BSOC) Estimation in Battery String Systems","sourcePdf":"55tie01-lee3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062314S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4418510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4418510","articleId":"4418523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4418525,"authors":[{"name":"Sudip K.

The effect of delay due to RF transmission on system stability and performance is analyzed, and regions of operation for a stable as well as satisfactory performance are determined. We experimentally demonstrate a satisfactory performance of the master-slave converter at 20-kHz switching frequency under steady state as well as transient conditions in the presence of a transmission delay.

It was developed with a view to portability, robustness, and ease of operation for very small samples. The rheometer operates by subjecting the samples to small-amplitude sinusoidal strain rates via an inverse piezoelectric actuator and detecting the stress response of the material via a direct piezoelectric sensor. The device operates under frequency-sweep mode in a very wide range of frequencies. Required sample sizes are typically three orders of magnitude smaller than for conventional rheometers. Owing to its lack of moving parts, the rheometer has an extremely simple design and is insensitive to vibration. Measurements on pressure-sensitive adhesives and other polymeric systems are presented and validated against a standard cone-and-plate rheometer.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viscosity","Polymers","Frequency","Rheology","Elasticity","Rubber","Robustness","Capacitive sensors","Piezoelectric actuators","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesives","microsensors","piezoelectric actuators","piezoelectric materials","polymers","rheology","viscoelasticity","viscometers","viscosity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectric minirheometer","viscosity measurement","polymer microsamples","electromechanical design","viscoelastic materials","sinusoidal strain rates","piezoelectric actuator","piezoelectric sensor","frequency-sweep mode","pressure-sensitive adhesives","polymeric systems","cone-and-plate rheometer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Actuator","gain measurement","piezoelectric material","rheology","sensor","viscosity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.910528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4418510/04418531.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.910528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Piezoelectric Minirheometer for Measuring the Viscosity of Polymer Microsamples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Piezoelectric Minirheometer for Measuring the Viscosity of Polymer Microsamples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418531/","volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418531/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9756556","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Piezoelectric Minirheometer for Measuring the Viscosity of Polymer Microsamples","sourcePdf":"55tie01-sanchez2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059349S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4418510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4418510","articleId":"4418531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4418532,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Kai Shyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4418510/4418532/4418532-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuo-Kai Shyu (M'98) received the B.S. degree from Tatung Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1979 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the National Chung-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1984 and 1987, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","In 1988, he joined the National Central University, Chung-Li, Taoyuan, Taiwan, where he is currently a Professor and the Chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering.

The proposed APF controller forces the supply current to be sinusoidal, with low current harmonics, and to be in phase with the line voltage. The advantages of using MRAC over conventional proportional-integral control are its flexibility, adaptability, and robustness; moreover, MRAC can self-tune the controller gains to assure system stability. Since the APF is a bilinear system, it is hard to design the controller. This paper will solve the stability problem when a linearization method is used to solve the nonlinearity of the system. Moreover, by using Lyapunov's stability theory and Barbalat's lemma, an adaptive law is designed to guarantee an asymptotic output tracking of the system. To verify the proposed APF system, a digital signal controller (dsPIC30F4012) is adopted to implement the algorithm of MRAC, and a 1-kVA laboratory prototype is built to test feasibility. Experimental results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed APF system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Active filters","Control systems","Power system modeling","Power harmonic filters","Pi control","Robust stability","Reactive power","Power system harmonics","Force control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","bilinear systems","linearisation techniques","Lyapunov methods","model reference adaptive control systems","power factor","power filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model reference adaptive control","MRAC design","shunt active-power-filter system","single-phase APF controller","line power factor","line current harmonics reduction","bilinear system","linearization method","Lyapunov's stability theory","Barbalat's lemma","digital signal controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active power filter (APF)","harmonics","model reference adaptive control (MRAC)","power factor (PF)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.906131","startPage":"97","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4418510/04418532.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.906131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Reference Adaptive Control Design for a Shunt Active-Power-Filter System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Model Reference Adaptive Control Design for a Shunt Active-Power-Filter System","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9756560","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","volume":"55","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418532/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Reference Adaptive Control Design for a Shunt Active-Power-Filter System","sourcePdf":"55tie01-shyu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068919S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4418510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"4418510","articleId":"4418532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4418535,"authors":[{"name":"Pericle Zanchetta","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group,  School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4418510/4418535/4418535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pericle Zanchetta (M'97) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Bari, Bari, Italy, in 1993 and 1997, respectively.","In 1998, he became an Assistant Professor of power electronics and control at the Technical University of Bari.

In this paper, a pixel level image fusion algorithm based on independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet transform is proposed. Firstly, we use the 2D discrete wavelet transform in order to extract multiple subband images, and then apply ICA on the subband images to get ICA bases, at last fuse the image by the independent component bases. The results show that it gives promising results as compared to previous methods and performs considerably well across a variety of multi-sensor imaging data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 1st Asian and Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418536/4418537/04418596.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"2007 1st Asian and Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar","doi":"10.1109/APSAR.2007.4418596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSAR.2007.4418596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pixel level image fusion based on ICA and wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Image fusion","Independent component analysis","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Application software","Computer vision","Object detection","Image processing","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","image fusion","independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pixel level image fusion","independent component analysis","2D discrete wavelet transform","subband image extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet transform","Independent Component Analysis (ICA)","Image Fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Pixel level image fusion based on ICA and wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418596/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9810019","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixel level image fusion based on ICA and wavelet transform","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12222007-00059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038969S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418536","isNumber":"4418537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418536","xplore-issue":"4418537","articleId":"4418596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4418632,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jin","affiliation":["College of Electronic Engineering, UESTC, China"],"lastName":"Li Jin","id":"37087025002"},{"name":"Min Rui","affiliation":["College of Electronic Engineering, UESTC, China"],"lastName":"Min Rui","id":"37087770320"},{"name":"Pi Yiming","affiliation":["College of Electronic Engineering, UESTC, China"],"lastName":"Pi Yiming","id":"37087332306"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1187-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1188-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4418632","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"This paper discusses the application of APES for analysis in SAR stereo imaging algorithm.

novel spectrum reconstruction algorithm for high resolution and wide swath space-borne SAR","abstract":"The displaced phase center multi-beam technique enables a wide-swath Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with high azimuth resolution. However, the pulse repetition frequency, sensor velocity and antenna size underlie a stringent timing requirement and any deviation will result in a non-uniform sampling in space domain. The paper derives an innovative frequency domain reconstruction algorithm, which enables a recovery of the unambiguous Doppler spectrum also in case of a non-uniform sampling. Theoretical analysis shows the swath and resolution can be simultaneously increased M (the number of sub-aperture) times. The potential of the algorithm when applied to the DPC SAR systems with 7 receive sub-apertures is demonstrated and the spurious image from the non-uniform sampling is suppressed to below -60dB. In addition, the fast algorithm of reconstruction in frequency domain is proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418711/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9859438","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418711/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel spectrum reconstruction algorithm for high resolution and wide swath space-borne SAR","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel spectrum reconstruction algorithm for high resolution and wide swath space-borne SAR","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12222007-00174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051865S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418536","isNumber":"4418537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418536","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4418537","articleId":"4418711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4418714,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Jiang","affiliation":["Artillery Academy of PLA, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38239485800"},{"name":"Chunhou Li","affiliation":["Artillery Academy of PLA, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chunhou","lastName":"Li","id":"38238992800"},{"name":"Xinwei Wu","affiliation":["Artillery Academy of PLA, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xinwei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293515900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1187-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1188-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4418714","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Sampling methods","Time domain analysis","Reconstruction algorithms","Image sampling","Algorithm design and analysis","Image reconstruction","Synthetic aperture radar","Computational complexity","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","sampling methods","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain reconstruction","nonuniform azimuth sampling","SAR signal","synthetic aperture radar","displaced phase centers multiple azimuth beams","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR","displaced phase center antenna (DPCA)","non-uniform azimuth sampling","time domain reconstruction","paired echo"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418714","abstract":"Wide-swath and high-resolution impose contradicting requirements on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system design and parameters choice.

As the case used a corridor of university building in Dubrovnik, for which calculation, simulation and measurement of signal strength were obtained. The results show an improvement in field strength prediction with neural models over conventional models if training algorithm and neural network architecture are carefully chosen. The best results are obtained by the radial basis function neural network model.","doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2007.4418842","startPage":"251","endPage":"254","displayPublicationTitle":"ELMAR 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418779/4418780/04418842.pdf","publicationTitle":"ELMAR 2007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR.2007.4418842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of neural network models for indoor field strength prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Multi-layer neural network","Multilayer perceptrons","Neurons","Ray tracing","Radial basis function networks","Floors","Indoor environments","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","multilayer perceptrons","radial basis function networks","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor field strength prediction","indoor environment","ray tracing","multilayer perceptron","radial basis function network","signal strength","training algorithm","neural network architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Radial Basis Function Network","Ray Tracing","Multilayer Perceptron","Training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of neural network models for indoor field strength prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4418842/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9777234","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of neural network models for indoor field strength prediction","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"SPI-12212007-00062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059521S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418779","isNumber":"4418780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418779","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4418780","articleId":"4418842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ELMARIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4418843,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Katalinic","affiliation":["Croatian Telecommunications Agency, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Katalinic","id":"38230596300"},{"name":"Robert Nagy","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37268479600"},{"name":"Radovan Zentner","affiliation":["Croatian Telecommunications Agency, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Radovan","lastName":"Zentner","id":"37268477700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-953-7044-05-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"4418843","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Electromagnetic scattering","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Telecommunication computing","Channel capacity","Topology","Costs","Narrowband","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","channel models","antenna elements","antenna topologies","maximum capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["limitations of MIMO","capacity","limitations","DAS","VAA"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with some of the open issues in the area of MIMO systems from a practical point of view.

From those advantages, they have low Ioff due to good SCE immunity with DIBL of 40 mV/V and SS of 84 mV/dec, low GIDL current, low junction leakage current, and low junction capacitance as well as no body bias dependence.

The ultimate scaling limit for PCM is also believed to be determined by the structural stability of nm-sized amorphous volumes. To improve the reliability and to predict the ultimate scaling perspectives of PCM technology, a comprehensive understanding of crystallization and relaxation physics is necessary. This work reviews the current understanding of the reliability properties of PCMs. The possibility to tailor the cell reliability by composition changes in the chalcogenide material will be addressed.

Accurate resistance and thermal conductivity models are provided for isolated SWCNTs and MWCNTs, as well as bundles of these, based on detailed electrical and thermal transport physics in sub-mum regime. It is found that although CNT via resistance may not be a significant concern for local interconnects, the resistance must be minimized in order to avoid significant degradation of global interconnect performance. Furthermore, detailed three dimensional electrothermal simulations show that Joule heating and the presence of thermal contact resistance between CNTs and metal, can be major bottlenecks in extracting maximum thermal performance from ballistic CNT bundle vias. From a processing perspective, we show that the applicability of MWCNT vias, which are currently being fabricated, is severely limited by their thermal and electrical resistance. For SWCNT vias, small diameter CNTs with dense packing and good thermal and electrical contacts between CNT and metal are needed.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2007.4418903","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418847/4418848/04418903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2007.4418903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418848","startPage":"207","endPage":"210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carbon Nanotube Vias: A Reality Check","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4418903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Carbon Nanotube Vias: A Reality Check","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418903/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9829080","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4418903/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carbon Nanotube Vias: A Reality Check","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"IEDM-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070363S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418847","isNumber":"4418848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418847","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4418848","articleId":"4418903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4418913,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Lun Cheng","affiliation":["R&D, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Hsinchu, Taiwan R.O.C."],"firstName":"Kuan-Lun","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37275534100"},{"name":"C.

Gate current degradation during RF power device operation is a great concern because it impacts PAE, gain, and output power. In this paper, we have experimentally studied gate current degradation under high forward and reverse bias conditions on the gate. We find that strong reverse bias on the gate produces defects that become paths for excess IG. On the other hand, strong forward bias on the gate degrades Schottky junction probably due to thermal effects.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2007.4418953","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418847/4418848/04418953.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"388","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2007.4418953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gate Current Degradation Mechanisms of GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Gate Current Degradation Mechanisms of GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4418953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9829121","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4418953/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gate Current Degradation Mechanisms of GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"IEDM-00-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060312S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418847","isNumber":"4418848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418847","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4418848","articleId":"4418953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":4418962,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Abdolvand","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Abdolvand","id":"37296448700"},{"name":"Hossein Mirilavasani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Mirilavasani","id":"37706640600"},{"name":"Farrokh Ayazi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Farrokh","lastName":"Ayazi","id":"37275433900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1507-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1508-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-017X"}],"articleNumber":"4418962","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":196},"abstract":"This paper reports on the design and implementation of a sub-milliwatt dual-frequency oscillator that utilizes two high-Q acoustic modes of an AIN-on-Si microresonator.

A small reset current of less than 100 muA was achieved by controlling the gate voltage of a cell transistor, which acts as an excellent current limiter in the set operation. A fast reset time of less than 5 ns was achieved by doping the Ti into the NiO film. Ti is thought to be effective to not only stabilize the reset process by forming an oxygen reservoir, but also to suppress the abnormal set phenomenon during the reset operation due to the formation of strong Ti-O bonds. Moreover, stable pulse switching with a large resistance change ratio has been successfully demonstrated using a unipolar voltage source of less than 3 V.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2007.4419060","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418847/4418848/04419060.pdf","startPage":"767","endPage":"770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2007.4419060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power and High Speed Switching of Ti-doped NiO ReRAM under the Unipolar Voltage Source of less than 3 V","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low Power and High Speed Switching of Ti-doped NiO ReRAM under the Unipolar Voltage Source of less than 3 V","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4419060/","accessionNumber":"9829212","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power and High Speed Switching of Ti-doped NiO ReRAM under the Unipolar Voltage Source of less than 3 V","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"IEDM-00-212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084027S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418847","isNumber":"4418848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418847","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4418848","articleId":"4419060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4419061,"authors":[{"name":"Myoung-Jae Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Semiconductor Device Laboratory, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Myoung-Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37310261900"},{"name":"Youngsoo Park","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Semiconductor Device Laboratory, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngsoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37281317200"},{"name":"Bo-Soo Kang","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Semiconductor Device Laboratory, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Bo-Soo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37633349400"},{"name":"Seung-Eon Ahn","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Semiconductor Device Laboratory, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Eon","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37401320500"},{"name":"Changbum Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Semiconductor Device Laboratory, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Changbum","lastName":"Lee","id":"38185658800"},{"name":"Kihwan Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Semiconductor Device Laboratory, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Kihwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280261900"},{"name":"Wenxu.

Our experimental results confirm previous observations that reset is controlled by Joule heating, providing an insight on the electrical and thermal parameters of the conductive filament (CF) in the low resistance state. The characterization of such parameters allows to model the CF rupture responsible for reset switching. Our model explains the switching by self-accelerated dissolution of the CF, and can quantitatively account for reset and data-retention experiments. The scaling of programming current is finally investigated by means of reduction of CF cross-section.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2007.4419062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2007.4419062","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418847/4418848/04419062.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conductive-filament switching analysis and self-accelerated thermal dissolution model for reset in NiO-based RRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Conductive-filament switching analysis and self-accelerated thermal dissolution model for reset in NiO-based RRAM","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9829214","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4419062/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conductive-filament switching analysis and self-accelerated thermal dissolution model for reset in NiO-based RRAM","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"IEDM-00-214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04037S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418847","isNumber":"4418848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418847","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"4418848","articleId":"4419062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4419063,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although the amorphous phase is quite stable with respect to crystallization, structural relaxation (SR), affecting the concentration of localized states in the band gap, strongly impacts the electrical properties of the amorphous phase even at room temperature. This work combines a previous physics-based model for transport in the chalcogenide glass and a new kinetic model for defect annealing, allowing to quantitatively account for the time and temperature dependences of SR and on its impact on the I-V curve for different read currents. The optimization of readout conditions to minimize the reliability impact is finally discussed.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2007.4419107","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4418847/4418848/04419107.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2007.4419107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical interpretation, modeling and impact on phase change memory (PCM) reliability of resistance drift due to chalcogenide structural relaxation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical interpretation, modeling and impact on phase change memory (PCM) reliability of resistance drift due to chalcogenide structural relaxation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9829253","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4419107/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419107/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical interpretation, modeling and impact on phase change memory (PCM) reliability of resistance drift due to chalcogenide structural relaxation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"IEDM-00-259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048923S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4418847","isNumber":"4418848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4418847","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4418848","articleId":"4419107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4419124,"authors":[{"name":"Keith Fife","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Fife","id":"37281720800"},{"name":"Abbas El Gamal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"El Gamal","id":"37295359000"},{"name":"H.-S.

Preventive maintenance (PM) activities are, therefore, done to these auxiliary components for the sake of extending the life of the primary component. Frequent PM care to auxiliary components increase the cost of PM while infrequent PM leads to increasing downtime of the primary component and, subsequently, production losses. The search for the optimal level of PM care requires a nonlinear programming (NLP) solution that can, sometimes, be very complex. This paper suggests that a very useful pattern exists in the NLP model of this optimization problem which can significantly reduce the complexity of model formulation and the arrival to the NLP solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4419130/4419131/04419272.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"662","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","doi":"10.1109/IEEM.2007.4419272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEM.2007.4419272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4419131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4419272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear programming solution for optimum PM schedule of auxiliary components","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Seals","Preventive maintenance","Inspection","Machinery","Mechanical engineering","Costs","Petroleum","Production facilities","Solenoids","Valves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear programming","preventive maintenance","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear programming solution","optimum PM schedule","auxiliary components","preventive maintenance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical Optimization","Nonlinear Programming","Preventive Maintenance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear programming solution for optimum PM schedule of auxiliary components","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4419272/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9822415","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear programming solution for optimum PM schedule of auxiliary components","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272007-00141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043792S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4419130","isNumber":"4419131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4419130","xplore-issue":"4419131","articleId":"4419272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4419303,"authors":[{"name":"M.

According to the modern portfolio theory, the fundamental principle of financial investments is a diversification where investors diversify their investments into different types of assets. Constructing an optimal risky portfolio is a high-dimensional constrained optimization problem where financial investors look for an optimal combination of their investments among different financial assets with the aim of achieving a maximum reward-to-variability ratio. Among the various methodologies suggested, the most popular one is based on maximizing the well-known Sharpe ratio. In this study, we apply particle swarm optimization (PSO) for constructing optimal risky portfolios based on Sharpe ratio for financial investments. A particle swarm solver is developed and tested on a risky investment portfolio. The method is applied to a sample of stocks in Tehran Stock Exchange. Experimental results reveal that the proposed PSO algorithm provides a very feasible and useful tool to assist the investors in planning their investment strategy and constructing their portfolio.","doi":"10.1109/IEEM.2007.4419303","pdfPath":"/iel5/4419130/4419131/04419303.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"816","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEM.2007.4419303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4419131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of particle swarm optimization in construction of optimal risky portfolios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of particle swarm optimization in construction of optimal risky portfolios","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9822444","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4419303/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of particle swarm optimization in construction of optimal risky portfolios","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272007-00172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063517S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4419130","isNumber":"4419131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4419130","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4419131","articleId":"4419303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":4419512,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohe.

This paper proposes a methodology that captures the dynamics of the supply chain, predicts and analyzes future behavior modes, and indicates potentials for modifications in the supply chain parameters in order to avoid or mitigate possible oscillatory behaviors. Neural networks are used to capture the dynamics from the system dynamic models and analyze simulation results in order to predict changes before they take place. Optimization techniques based on genetic algorithms are applied to find the best setting of the supply chain parameters that minimize the oscillations. A case study in the electronics manufacturing industry is used to illustrate the methodology.","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2007.4419826","startPage":"1968","endPage":"1976","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Winter Simulation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4419575/4419576/04419826.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 Winter Simulation Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2007.4419826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4419576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis of the supply chain by using neural networks and genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Supply chains","Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Supply chain management","Companies","Predictive models","Globalization","Feedback loop","Modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","supply chain management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","supply chain","neural network","genetic algorithm","optimization technique","electronics manufacturing industry","system dynamic model","simulation result analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of the supply chain by using neural networks and genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4419826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9847952","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of the supply chain by using neural networks and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272007-00250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057457S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4419575","isNumber":"4419576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4419575","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4419576","articleId":"4419826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4419916,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoping Yun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4447379/4419916/4419916-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoping Yun (S'86\u2013M'87\u2013SM'96\u2013F'05) received the B.S. degree from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1982 and the M.S. and D.Sc. degrees from Washington University, St. Louis, MO, in 1984 and 1987, respectively.","He is currently a Professor of electrical and computer engineering with the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA.

Some formulation of the QUaternion ESTimator (QUEST) algorithm is commonly used to solve this problem. Triads of accelerometers and magnetometers are used to measure gravity and local magnetic field vectors in sensor coordinates. In the QUEST algorithm, local magnetic field measurements affect not only the estimation of yaw but also that of roll and pitch. Due to the deviations in the direction of the magnetic field vector between locations, it is not desirable to use magnetic data in calculations that are related to the determination of roll and pitch. This paper presents a geometrically intuitive 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) orientation estimation algorithm with physical meaning [which is called the factored quaternion algorithm (FQA)], which restricts the use of magnetic data to the determination of the rotation about the vertical axis. The algorithm produces a quaternion output to represent the orientation. Through a derivation based on half-angle formulas and due to the use of quaternions, the computational cost of evaluating trigonometric functions is avoided. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has an overall accuracy that is essentially identical to that of the QUEST algorithm and is computationally more efficient. Additionally, magnetic variations cause only azimuth errors in FQA attitude estimation. A singularity avoidance method is introduced, which allows the algorithm to track through all orientations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4447379/04419916.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.911646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.911646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4419916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified Quaternion-Based Algorithm for Orientation Estimation From Earth Gravity and Magnetic Field Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earth","Gravity","Magnetic field measurement","Quaternions","Magnetic sensors","Accelerometers","Magnetometers","Coordinate measuring machines","Computational efficiency","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","gravimeters","gravity","magnetic field measurement","magnetic sensors","magnetometers","motion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quaternion-based algorithm","orientation estimation","Earth gravity measurement","magnetic field measurement","accelerometers","magnetometers","QUEST algorithm","trigonometric function","azimuth errors","singularity avoidance method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerometers","inertial sensors","magnetic sensors","motion measurement","orientation estimation","quaternions"]},{"kwd":["Accelerometers","inertial sensors","magnetic sensors","motion measurement","orientation estimation","quaternions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified Quaternion-Based Algorithm for Orientation Estimation From Earth Gravity and Magnetic Field Measurements","volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4419916/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9792361","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified Quaternion-Based Algorithm for Orientation Estimation From Earth Gravity and Magnetic Field Measurements","sourcePdf":"57tim03-yun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081839S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4447379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"4447379","articleId":"4419916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4419951,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond G.

These problems will grow as wire diameters scale down and the resistance-capacitance product of the interconnect wires increases hyperbolically, which threatens to choke off the computational performance increases of chips that we have come to expect over time. We examine some of the quantitative implications of these trends by analyzing the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. We compare the potential of replacing the global electronic interconnect of future chips with a photonic interconnect and see that there is in principle a four order of magnitude bandwidth-to-power ratio advantage for the latter. This indicates that it could be possible to dramatically improve chip performance without scaling transistors but rather utilize the capability of existing transistors much more efficiently. However, at this time it is not clear if these advantages can be realized. We discuss various issues related to the architecture and components necessary to implement on-chip photonic interconnect.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.911057","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4432785/04419951.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.911057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanoelectronic and Nanophotonic Interconnect","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Nanoelectronic and Nanophotonic Interconnect","volume":"96","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9757228","htmlLink":"/document/4419951/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanoelectronic and Nanophotonic Interconnect","sourcePdf":"96jproc02-beausoleil.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103533S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4432785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"4432785","articleId":"4419951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4419979,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Arcing faults are substantially unconstrained free-burning arcs within electrical equipment. In order to assess the hazards of arcing faults to personnel in the immediate vicinity of the fault it is necessary to understand their nature and be able to quantify the hazards. This involves an understanding of the energy dissipation and the energy transfers in the near vicinity of these uncontrolled arcs. This paper sets out to describe the physics of arcing faults and uses this to describe the energy transfers within an arcing fault. This is the basis for describing the potential energy transfers to personnel in the vicinity of an arcing fault.","doi":"10.1109/ICEFA.2007.4419983","publicationTitle":"2007 8th International Conference on Electric Fuses and their Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 8th International Conference on Electric Fuses and their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4419952/4419953/04419983.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEFA.2007.4419983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4419953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy transfers within arcing faults in electrical equipment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4419983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4419983/","displayDocTitle":"Energy transfers within arcing faults in electrical equipment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 2007","accessionNumber":"9765989","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4419983/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy transfers within arcing faults in electrical equipment","confLoc":"Ceyrat, France","sourcePdf":"SPI-12282007-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043162S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4419952","isNumber":"4419953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4419952","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4419953","articleId":"4419983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Blaise Pascal University Academic Press","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
